0,Not uploaded on git.
0,"There is no Github link provided. Instead the code was zipped in an archive and posted on Expertizza. The code has no implementation of any functionality whatsoever, however, 'scaffold' code files exist in the zip with nil developer implementation. Code for 'house' is added though."

0,"The project is not deployed on either of mentioned cloud platforms such as Heroku, AWS or VCL. Instead an locally run server's IP link is provided, which doesn't seem to work. As a result, I cannot test the interface at all. No README is provided as well."
0,I Don't see the Deployment URL to comment on this and rest other UI questions. Requesting to upload the GIT Link and Deployment URL in Expertiza instead of the Project Folders

0,No test cases have been implemented for any entity.
0,"Yes, the controllers have been properly tested."
0,"�There are some tests for the controllers, but it looks like just the scaffold generated tests."
0,"The team has implemented modules like: Login, signup, logout, List all companies and List all houses. However, they lack in many functionalities and under each module. So they are not properly implemented. They lack validations, session management and things like multiple same email addresses can be registered with different users. � Hence, no the team has not thoroughly tested at least one model or controller."
0,only the default testcases created by the command are present in the repository.
0,"There are 24 commits done, however all have been made on one day."
0,There are no proper commit messages.
0,"No, I just see all commits happened in one day, so I don't think the team has been keeping on pushing their changes."
0,"�No, there has been only one commit on 10/01."
0,"No, The changes were made and pushed only in one particular day. There is no consistent flow on GitHub for pushing."
0,All the changes were pushed on a single day. the last day of submission.
0,Nothing mentioned in readme file. user interface not easy .just provided links for realtor creation. No link for house hunter.
0,"Basic navigation is missing. For example, Once a user click on the edit profile and tries to navigate, its difficult to return to home page.� There are no details available in the readme file to help with the application flow."
0,"Readme file is not updated and there are no instructions on how an admin or a house hunter can log in. The UI, though it didn't have any styling, is intuitive and self explanatory. �"
0,"No, not really. The website just has one role to operate, and the readme file is an auto-generated file, which doesn't include any useful information."
0,"Nearly all of the links seem to go to the wrong pages. For example, ""Back"" in Viewing Houses took me to a list of Users that had signed up, while logged in as a Realtor."
0,Interface is very basic It lacks in many major functionalities that made the navigation through the site difficult. README was not well described to understand the team's work and their functionalities.
0,the README file is not maintained by the developer. The design is not complete. Whatever is done is intuitive but incomplete.
0,Some indentation issues in the project.For example in index.html.erb indentation is not proper. Splelling mistakes.For example in hunters view in index .html.erb� prefered spelling is wrong.
0,The ruby coding convention has been followed�through out the project.
1,"The team followed good practices. No repetition of the code. DRY principles uses. How, there is an empty controller though, which is, the commons_controller.rb. What is its purpose?"
1,"The MVC structure is good, but some details should� be improved."
0,�Yeah in a way. The scaffolding generated code follows convention.
1,"The code follows the common ""Ruby on rails"" application structure:  Hence, it was easy for me to navigate through other files to see portion of the code. It follows the common MVC structure. However, In some parts of the code, comments were missing which was confusing as I didn't understand the logic for that code. README file was not properly described for other users navigating through app."
0,"The application is modled according to the ruby practices but lacks the use of ruby features such as validations , associations and active record.�"
1,"The code is very well written, properly organised and good architecture. No repetition. Cons Application logic written in controllers, for example, house_controller, which can be ported to the respective models."
0,The controllers are well-written.
0,"The code follows ""good Ruby and Rails coding practice"" from my point of view."
0,Requesting to GIT Link to verify the same
0,Have used DRY principles. The code has good readability and good naming conventions are followed. Have grouped similar functionalities into classes so that it is modularized. Have used iterators such as each instead of for and while.
0,UI/UX is awesome and intuitive. Read me file is also well described.
0,The README is empty and does not contain the admin account information. It's hard to navigate around the interface and determine where all the functionality is.
1,"UI looks nice but I found the it to be a bit confusing. The relation between User, House Hunter and Realtor is not apparent. It would helpful if it could be explained in detail in the README file."
0,The interface was simple. Some of the fields input were not mentioned like for creating house
0,Requesting to GIT Link to verify the same. But i downloaded the Zipped file to see if there is admin credentials in README file and it was not there.
0,The user interface is easy to use and the README file is explicit.
0,Great UI. Admin dashboard looks very professional.
0,"Controller test cases have been covered, but no model test cases can be seen."
0,Tests exist for the controller but not models.
0,Spec folder is not there. There are some tests in the test folder.
0,I was able to check for the realtor and house hunter. Some of the functionality of a realtor and househunter weren't working.
0,Yes you have the tests written.
1,The basics test are written. Some application specific tests can be written.
0,There are only four commits visible and no proper commit messages. Initial commit has 228 file changes.
0,All commits were made on one day
0,It seems that there is only one team member pushing changes.
0,Looks like the team has committed the project as a whole. Bug fixes are done incrementally.
0,"The project has successfully named it's varables and function names according to the principle. They are understandable form what the mean. But the project lacks any documentation internally, as well as a proper external readme file. Lack of code documentation makes it tough for the reviewer to make sense of the code. Apart from that, the design of the database schema isn't normalized to much extent, which makes data entries redundant."
0,The MVC structure is completed. and basic functions have been finished.
0,The model and controller are well designed. Each method covers a single functionality! Good job
0,"From what I see it looks like code we have seen in class. Although in the model classes, they don't have any associations between models."
1,"The code itself appears to be very clean.�The lack of scaffolding (or the stripped down scaffolding that it presents) means there's a lot less dead code in the files. All the indentation and variable names appear to follow convention as well. This cleanliness, on further inspection, appear to stem from the fact that the application frequently does not�support needed functionality. The code that's there is clean though."
1,"Overall, the code looks fine. Good code is self-documenting - So, your code could be improved by�adding comments in all required places. Make use of�different logging�options provided by ROR and avoid using ""puts"" in code."
1,The Code is structured as per basic rails norms. The CRUD operations operations actions could have followed the usual norms than custom actions defined. The routes config could have been more efficiently defined using match than defining each routes separately.
1,"All users have their own model controllers. The code is following Ruby on Rails standards but there are some debug ""puts"" that should�be removed."
1,"The user interface is very simple, clear and straightforward. But it lacks depth where it should have been extensive. For example, after signing up for the first time, the user is directed by to the login page to login again. This is not very user friendly, and is rather redundant. One must automatically sign in after creating an account. Also, the application should deduce whether I'm a realtor or a househunter or an admin from the email ID i entered. I should atleast now have to specify for househunter or realtor about my role."
1,The UI is basic as of now. The 'show profile' link is broken.
0,"the interface is good, clean and very easy to use."
0,They are simple links to pages which does tell you where to go so it's fine.
1,"All the buttons�which do what they say they do are quite good. Quite reasonably, I can click on these buttons and the expected behavior occurs. It's a little weird to have to select whether I want to log in as a house hunter, a realtor, or the admin at the login screen, and that it doesn't work without selecting the right user type. � Unfortunately, many buttons do not do what they say, or redirect the application to a dead page. Here are the functionalities which do not work: 1. Attempting to delete Real Estate Company makes you view Real Estate Company detailed info. Inquiries�do the same. 2. Attempting to 'show' anything�that's not a real estate company throws a 406. 3. As a realtor, I tried to Update/add company information and my change was rejected. 4. The List a House form has 'create company' as its submit button.� � There are also many things I expected to be able to do that there were not buttons or links for."
0,The UI is elementary but intuitive. The links have long descriptive names
0,Yes it is deployed on Heroku.
1,"The login / signup module seems to be well tested of all the other models and controllers in the program. But this module has a drawback. It deals with three tables, the realtors, the househunters and the admin. Due to this kind of segmentation, there is a repetition of data i the database, if any user would like to signup as both. Also, it would make it difficult to handle complexity as the application grows. According to me, its better to atleast cascade the tables of realtors and house hunters into one.� The other functionalities are not wholly implemented, only the CRUD operations related to those are implemented, hence not much could be reviewed about testing."
0,"The project needs validations on all fields (I was able to enter random values in email address, mobile number fields). Some of the additional functionalities were missing (filter inquiry, see who has added my house to their inquiry list etc). The project is well connected and navigation is easy. Overall it looks very clean and intuitive!�"
1,I don't think the test has been finished. the controller test file is basic empty and the same empty in the model test file.
0,"No, not really. No user type has all the functionality in this review's check boxes, much less all the functionality specified in the project description. Manual inspection of the test folder reveals that all the model and controller tests are empty, as are the fixtures."
0,"No, testing is not covered yet."
0,"Yes, the team seems to have tested their UsersController completely that handles login, logout and other user signin validations"
0,Admin and Realtor's functionalities are partially working. Many other features need to implement.�
0,"The project only has 3 commits, all on� a single day. So yes, it can't be said that the project was implemented or developed over a period of time.�"
0,The code was presumable uploaded in the end (pushed from another repo) and hence I could not see any regular commits.
0,"I can not see the completed devolepment procedure, the only commit in the github is happend on Monday, the week of 9/30."
0,No. They only have 3 commits and 1 branch so that means they waited until the last minute to do thi
1,"I cannot appraise this because�I do not believe they did their development in the linked repo. There is only one commit, where all the functionality was added. I am inclined to say the team was not actively developing over the project period."
0,"In total, there are only 3 commits done!"
0,"No, according to the Git history, there has not been no changes pushed after Oct 1st"
1,I could see only one person's commits. Each team member�needs to contribute to Git.
0,"The models, views and controllers have been properly designed and implemented."
0,Most of the practices have been followed
0,"The ruby source code appears to follow RoR conventions, and uses a few Rails associations. The directory names and project structure appear to follow good RoR MVC conventions. Source code is organized and uncluttered too."
0,The code is written�really well.
0,"Very good structure, readable and names are very relevant to the functionality"
0,The code is neat and precise with proper structure and comments
0,"The overall UI is good, but there can be some improvements made on the admin part of the app. We need to change the link manually to end up at the admin dashboard."
0,"The UI is mostly easy to use, but the README is nearly undocumented."
0,Good design and easy to use.
0,The deployed link is not accessible. The readme file describes the process for just admin login but not for the consequent steps.�
0,The UI is straight forward and easy to use. The implementation of the menu bar makes it look better. Though there is a scope for improvement. The admin link in the Readme file is not working.
0,"nice user interface, good use layouts. but unable to log in as admin,"
1,UI is nicely done.� There are a few things that can be improved:� 1. Clear all / list all houses field once a search parameter has been given 2. Do not show receiver object id in inquiries. Maybe something more useful.
0,Controller has been tested �
0,"They tested at least one controller, but none of the models."
0,"The team has added functionality for login through google sign-in, but I couldn't verify it's working.��"
1,the realtor and house hunter controllers work as desired in most cases though there are some cases which need to be addressed. There is a need to validate the real estate creation form.
0,extensive testing was done
0,Yes.
0,Team was active thoughout the process
0,"No, the majority of the work was pushed on 09/29. It is an impressive product if they got all of this done in the past week."
0,There are many commits which are divided almost equally between all teammmates
0,yes about 75� commits were done
0,Code commit frequency is good.
0,The code is very well written and arranged to be easily understandable. No extraneous code or unused code visible. DRY principles have been implemented very well.
0,Very clearly code
0,"I think it does pretty well to follow the�""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". It is elegant and follows the DRY code approach."
0,This team has followed the basic structure followed in every ruby on rails application which made my task easier to access files and understand their logic. Properly described README file and also one additional pdf given with application was enough to give me proper understanding of the modules.
0,ReadMe file contains enough information to understand the project implementation basics.
1,Please directly tall users where to sign up.
0,The user interface is very intuitive and easy to use. It is very well explained in the README file. The steps to run the code are described as well.
0,"Yes, the user interface is intuitive and easy to use. also, the README file has been perfectly described to give the proper idea of the flow and login credentials of an admin."
0,Basic scaffold generated tests available.
0,"Yes, from what I could see, they have done well in testing at least one model and one controller."
0,"Team has perfectly implemented major modules and also they have implemented the extra credit portion. I tried to login with invalid credentials or some invalid password-email-phone lengths: but there were validations. Hence, they have perfectly focused on this parts too and tested it. � I believe this has implemented a through test of at least one module and controller."
0,Several linear commits with good explanations available.
0,"Tem has properly used Git and only pushed the changes when necessary and also, consistently throughout the project period."
0,Well written code.
0,Not a lot of code to begin with but whatever is there seems by coding practice norms. Most of the code seems to be commented
0,The code base is very minimum. Many functionalities are not implemented.
0,"Yes partially, the code has the parameters not well defined for all only one�conceivable�user seemingly admin and that too is doubtful to have the correct MVC Layout.� For instance, they seem to have created separate MVC architectures for Admins, Companies and Users only. This goes to show that they are lacking in a layered approach on access and privileges.� Also, the code is written in a reasonably clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self-explanatory of the functionalities they perform in most cases for whichever few roles defined.�"
0,"The code is properly written with good Ruby practices, however, no comments are mentioned."
0,"It seems as though you have an awful lot of controllers that are supposed to have something to do with authentication that either don't get used or don't have any code in them. Other than that, the project looks organized like a Ruby on Rails project should be. There is a lot of code that is hard to follow, and I can't discern its purpose in several controllers."
0,"Yes, the code follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices as the models, views and controllers are well defined"
0,Readme not well defined
0,"The login opens the user page which has which has 5 ""back"" links for some reason and they do not do anything. No common home page for all the list views. Have to all the list views go from user pages. List of companies is not in tabulated form, thus very difficult to read"
0,I cannot create any hunter or realtor accounts.
1,This UI is pretty good. It's fairly intuitive to follow. The only thing I'd recommend is to have a link to the signup page on your welcome screen.
1,There is a scope of improvement by eliminating multiple 'back' links on each page.
0,Readme file is absent.
0,"Admin -� Not able to create a Real estate company - loads error page After creating a new user, not able to see the user in the list Couldn't find sign�up for a realtor/House hunter - throwing an error -�  Company must exist  This is because�of the foreign key reference and while creating the user there is no field to select one so it gets an empty or nil value. No houses and inquiries functionality created yet. Not able to check the functionalities of�house hunter and realtor as was not able to sign up for that user because�of the above error"
1,"It is not a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation not achieved in it due to the ill defined 'db' folders and the routes.rb file in git hub makes the session linkage a bit hard to follow.� Also, I fail to understand the structural flow of the program even after logging in after signing up. So, I get easily confused on what to do. Sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don't know what to do and that are we admins or any other user. Privilege separation has not been done. Also, the README barely resolve the dilemma and is of minimal help to us to follow the steps.�"
0,"The interface is preliminary, but is easy to understand."
0,"Doesn't seem like it. only user and company part have been implemented and I was able to delete the admin user easily,and in the company edit view for e.g year input doesn't check for a valid year(398343 is a valid year). Therefore it has not been thoroughly tested"
0,"There seems to be many functionalities missing. I cannot register as hunter or realtor. Hunter, Realtor, Interest of Buying, Inquiries ...These model do not appear to be in the folder app/models/... Seems to be an incomplete project, unless the previous reviewer cracked the system."
0,"Functionalities are incomplete,�while able to log in through admin, cannot�edit or create any other user because of the error."
0,"No, that doesn't seem to be the case since, it has been a very jumpy approach and also the functionality of only a basic login has been added. So, if adding the bare login and sign up is considered as an MVC architecture then they have surely built a bare backbone of it.�"
0,The team hasn't yet implemented any proper testing
0,"the User model has been tested, although I can't say it is thorough at this point, as it only tests the validity that is already required by the model."
0,"The admin functionality is tested well, however there are some fields like validations of phone number which are yet to be tested or improved upon"
0,Functionalities of admins are working.Though many other functionalities�are yet to be implemented.
0,"There are only ten commits and that too only from one account, which means it has only been done by one individual and not a team."
0,I did see updates and commits 15 hours ago.
0,"Yes, added the working functionalities timely."
0,"Yes, seems to be so the case in effect the last commit being just 5 hrs ago. But what changes against each file have been made is not clear hence its a bit unclear as to the extent and the number of changes made. Moreover, the amount of subject matter and the number of sessions or models are far too less to be implementing any changes as such.�"
0,The team has been pushing commits in a way that shows they have been making consistent progress on the project.
0,"Yes, they have around 21 commits."
0,I could see commits by only one person. Need team contribution.
0,Most files seem to be following good coding practices.
0,The readme file is well constructed. MVC files are properly made and easy to navigate. DB migrations can be seen easily as well. Overall good job done on this part.
0,The app was designed according to the ruby conventions and coding practices. The necessary authorizations are used along with gems to handle user session. Some models do not have the complete validations but the validations in place are using the ruby practices. The active record and association between models is also used in the project.�
0,Fairly good coding practices followed.
1,"UI is easy to use, a suggestion would be to display tables of data better, with better�spacing (the list houses page for example has the columns cramped up together)"
1,"The User Interface is very intuitive. The idea to add a field for preferred contact is very smart and relevant. Displaying the number of registered users, however, seems irrelevant to the house hunter and realtor. Perhaps this can be a function of the admin account where it would be more relevant."
0,The UI is well built as well. Specially the navigation bar at the top is a delight in terms of User experience.
0,"No, the README file tells me what I should do to test in local computer, and does not offer admin's information or any instruction of how to operate when login to the website."
0,"Yes the UI is pretty smooth and a person can navigate freely. However, in some cases there is no ""back"" link in the web-page, so the user has to use browser navigation to go to the previous page."
0,The design lacks dynamic paging for different users. all the links are visible to all the users and upon clicking the links an error comes that you are not authorized to perform the action. Ideally only relevant links should be visible to the user. It confuses the user regaring the actions he/she can perform. The user needs to perform all the actions visible in the UI to know what are the actions relevant for him/her. The readme file also is not well described about the actions that can be performed by the user. The readme file currently lacks any relevant information.
0,"I could only check househunter�UI. Since I could not find admin and realtor code on github�either, I believe you are yet to implement the functionality.� The UI I viewed was easy to use. Further site is responsive and incorporates several new features like requiring password for editing the profile. I guess that was work of a gem, but either way, good work!"
0,Yes. The controller and model for handling inquiries have been thoroughly tested.
0,Extra credit features have not been implemented. No google sign-in and no email replies�
0,The default testcases are present for some controllers. All the functionalities test are not present for the controllers. The models are not testes.
0,Could not find custom tests.
0,"With a total of 77 commits, the team has actively pushed changes to the project. Although not all commits are labeled very accurately, it is still easy to comprehend the pushed changes."
0,"The team kept on pushing changes throughout the project period, showing timely contributions from each team member. In fact, by looking at the commits, each team member was probably assigned a dedicated module to work on, which always works well to create such a big application."
0,"Yes, through the commit record, I can see that this team has been keeping pushing their changes."
0,"There are more than 70 commits , and they have been working continously"
0,There were regular commits during the course of the project.
0,Fairly frequent commits to GIT.
0,"Just one table is used for all users. Therefore there is no distinction among the admin, realtor and the house_hunter"
0,"Not much functionality is available. Of what is available, however, the code does follow�""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"""
0,The code there seems to be well organized. But the problem is that many functionalities are missing and there aren't too much code in models and controllers.
0,Code is using Basic Ruby on Rails Structure which by default provides the CRUD Functionalty. But no details of Admin login provided. Also some of the models seem to be missing.
0,The code is well written. I noticed the controller for inquiries is well written but it is unclear how to access all those functionalities from the front-end.
0,"The code is very neat and easy to read, but i can tell it is the auto generated code from scaffold.�"
0,User interface should not show the location Users#dashboard � Find me in app/views/users/dashboard.html.erb
0,"The application has bare minimum functionalities of what was required. A user signup and login has been implemented, but no information about what type of user has signed up/ logged in is available. ReadMe file is the default and no changes have been made to it."
0,"The application portal is same for all the 3 users. Therefore all users have been given same permissions. � ReadMe does not contain admin credentials . Hence, can't test admin functionalities"
0,No admin account provided. No user role selections. Seems to be an incomplete project. Looks like they use scaffolding to generate the templates but didn't fill in the necessary code.
0,"UI displays session info, file paths and # tags. Could be improved with little efforts"
0,"No information for admin login credentials provided anywhere. Under signing-up, no option to sign up as a realtor or a hunter is given. They should be able to do that because otherwise the functionalities aren't being differentiated for a hunter and a realtor.�"
0,"The application is deployed on Heroku, and the user interface is easy to use."
0,"The implementation can only log one type of user on and even though not specified, the user has all controls so it can be assumed its an admin. Admins can signup as well."
0,There is just one user role in the current submission. Unable to test the admin functionality
0,No roles implemented.�
0,Basic Tests are present. Not custom tests though
0,"No, none of the controllers or models have been tested."
0,"Actually i did find some auto generated test code for the controllers, but i don't think it is a thoroughly test. And there is no test code for the model."
0,total of 10 commits are visible on got but do not show a linear increment in the work done.
0,Yes. Good effort in case of pushing changes
0,No updates since 6 days ago
0,Only on 2 days all together
0,"I looked through their github commits log, and found that their first commit is on�Sep 28,2018. Maybe their just began to do the project on�Sep 28?"
0,Total of only 10 commits has been made on 3 days.
0,Most code seems to be written with good coding practices in mind.
0,The repository looks to be set up well and the app is laid out like a typical Ruby on Rails application. Good README file was present as well.
1,The code looks great. It's all scaffolding and really lean view modifications.
0,"good coding style, names are well selected and good readability."
0,"They use correct files to do specific behaviors and make advantage of the features ruby and rails provides. However, I think the structure of the files is not clear enough."
0,Have used DRY principles. Followed good coding practices.
0,The code follows the right style and in a good format.
1,"UI doesn't have proper navigation in many pages. A suggestion would be to display the data in a more spaced out way, using html tables or such methods, as it looks very cramped and confusing."
0,"While some links were easy to find and navigate, after editing houses and companies, I could not return back to a good home screen. I also was unable to log out.�"
1,"I'm docking some points here because Heroku doesn't appear to work. I think some malicious reviewer deleted the admin and the real estate company, and surprise! If a company doesn't exist, it doesn't let any user sign up.� � Please re-seed your database so I can test your app. �"
1,I cannot get access to the interface and the readme is not provided. They should provide a readme file later to state how can I test the project.
0,"Have listed out the functionality which is very intuitive. But some links like 'As realtor' and 'As house hunter' are broken, making a bit of a confusion."
1,"deployed on Heroku. Friendly interface, good README file."
0,"Navigation is hard, while some models seem to work for most cases, inquiries for example is not tested, as im unable to create an inquiry"
0,They had a good amount of tests the UserModel.
0,The code in controller.rb files are still incomplete for CRUD operations so I am not aware if this was tested properly.
0,comprehensively tested for users
0,"In the files they provided, I found they provided test for most of controllers and models."
1,Have implemented basic testing. Could add more application specific test cases.
0,"Last commit was 3 days ago, so they are not continuous throughout the period."
0,"Yes, it looks like all team members contributed and they have 80 commits over the course of several weeks."
0,"So many commits! It makes me proud. Starting as early as September 22nd, they make progress up until... today?! Either way, they passed this with flying colors."
0,about 80 commits were done along the timspan
0,"According to the record on github, they committed for many times, so they may keep pushing changes."
0,Evenly committed code during the project duration.
0,The team pushed changes frequently.
0,The code is very well written and organised. All the framework conventions have been followed such as the naming conventions. Comments have been added at appropriate places which improved the readability.
1,yes. code is written properly. followed dry principle. added comments where possible. followed mvc with rails framework.
0,"First of all, this website doesn't work at all. I can't sign up as any role. And I also can't get admin's info from README file, which is an auto-generated file."
0,"It does well to follow the ""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". It follows the DRY code approach."
1,"Looking at your code on github , you guys are following good coding practices. Just at some places you have repeated you code, for example in /myaccounts/show.html.erb you are repeating alot of code. You can create one html file for the repeated code and call it based on the object or move the repeated code to a�section and use it."
0,The Git code included almost everything that follows good coding practices using Ruby and Rails.�
0,"Readme file is not updated. Couldn't find admin credentials. The UI looked promising on the login page but the signup fails, i am not able to sign up either as a house hunter or as a realtor. Tried so many times in all possible ways. Without these I couldn't test any of the functionalities. The error message was ""Sign Up failed, Please retry"""
0,yes. User Interface is good and easy to access.
0,"No, the README file is an auto-generated file, and there is no details in it."
0,A little confusing as there are two sign up forms one under the other and it is not clear what they are for.
0,Only the registration page is working and the interface is quite confusing as it has sign-up for both realtor and hunter on the same page which is bit confusing.
0,"Admin credentials not provided, realtor and house hunter signup throws error so unable to use app."
0,"You�haven't specified anything in�your Readme file. Plus�you have given a link to heroku app but its not working. Please make sure its working. I saw you guys had been committing code to your master branch, have you guys pushed it to heroku. That might be the reason it got broken.�"
0,The UI seems to be flexible. It could include trace back to the home page. The README file could include the details to login as email. This would be helpful to use the site to it's full potential.
0,No model test cases. Controllers not tested exhaustively.
0,"Team has tested hounse hunter functionalities but not admin and realtor functionalities. Register page asks us to put credentials twice. We are able to register for house hunter only irrespective of choosing any field (house hunter or realtor). Hence I am not able to login into realtor account. Also�could not find any credentials for admin, realtor or house hunter in readme file.� Hence not able to login into admin account also. � New link provided in document is not working. If would be great it team could check the link and come back."
0,I don't think the test part of this website is working.
0,You guys haven't implemented unit test for your project yet.�
0,The house hunter model seemed to work according to most of the tasks mentioned. Not for the admin and realtor ones. Was unable to login as admin. Was unable t signup as realtor.�
0,Excellent commit history. Contributions from all team members could be seen.
0,Yes I could see many push requests on the github. Hence concluding team is pushing their changes periodically.
0,"I find few changing records from github, but I can't show the process of development."
0,"Yes, the team kept pushing changes throughout the project period"
0,There was consistent commits with a spike in between when probably most development happened
0,"looking at�your commit history,�you guys started it on Saturday when the submission was Monday."
0,"The website did not seem to work at first. Now I was able to access it. I also noticed some features that were included in the meantime like testing by adding house hunters. Overall, the team did work on updating the site functionalities.�"
0,Only basic operation�is available. Need to add lots of functionality.�
0,"The Git repo shows total of 15 commits. Although majority of the places Ruby Standards have been followed but at some places variables names such as (househunter_url) does not show any relavancy�or understandidng�to the reader. If the variable is pointing to a function or belongs to, for example it can be house_hunt_xyz. Overall I think good standards are being followed.�"
0,The code has good style and recognizable convention over configuration. There are some line spacing issues however.
0,"Yes we can see many pushes on git. Hence , they have updated code."
0,Timely commits and elaborated readme file.
1,"The models , views and controllers are well created.   1)����� You can seed data for the admin into your production environment. The command to do this on heroku is heroku run rails db:seed. You need to make changes in the db/seeds.rb file and add your admin credentials in the proper format in this file."
1,"Everything seems good. You can move constants to a separate file and use them . For example where you are comparing ==""admin"" or ==""realtor"". You can either move them to a separate file or in database and use it."
0,"The code is clear and concise, it does follow good Ruby and Rails coding practices."
0,"Yes, the code does follow Ruby and Rails practices to an extent, as I can see the use of many helper methods in the code."
1,Stress is given to MVC architecture. But proper comments in the code section can simplify the code understanding for other users.
0,The bulk of the code I deciphered was auto-generated�via scaffold but the code that is changed follows good practices.
0,Most files seem to be following good Ruby and Rails practices.
0,Did a good job using forms to stay dry with the edit and new pages. Some more comments especially in the models would have been helpful to understand why certain validations were chosen. The use of JSON to store and recall in views was clever.
0,"This application has the layout expected of a Rails application. However, not enough information was included in the README file about installation."
0,yes. It is well written and they managed to follow DRY principle.
0,Code follows the basic CRUD structure given by Rails and neatly explains what is being performed. The notices nicely explains the user what is happening. The db schema is designed to incorporate most of the requirements.
0,"Reviewed the Git code for all controller , models and views .�standard ruby coding practices have been followed and code is easily readable�"
0,Not much of coding is done. Only the files automatically created by rails are present.
0,"Code follows 'good Ruby and Rails coding practices'. Naming�conventions are correct, methods in controllers are short and concise and there are no instances of 'spaghetti code'."
0,"Most of the code is well organized and follows�""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". But I found some code has indentation problems. For example, in session_controller.rb, line 12-29 have obvious indentation problem."
1,"The UI for the login page is the only thing that loads, as I'm unable to sign up. A suggestion for the future would be to provide a username and password for an account that is already created to be provided somewhere to ensure a reviewer can log in even if signing up does not work."
0,The readme file is still the default provided by rails. I don't have access to an admin login and when I try to sign up for a new account(realtor or hunter) I get redirected to a webpage telling me that something went wrong. The small ammount of the UI that does exist(login and create account) seems easy enough to understand but it appears that without logging in I cannot see any other links.
0,Yes user interface is easy to use on the first page.
0,Readme.md file has no details on how to login and the signup pages for house hunter and realtors are not working. So no way of navigating the application fully.
0,"Readme file doesn't details on setting up account for admin.� I tried signing up new user for realtor and house hunter , whenever I try to sign up it is throwing error. it could be an issue with heroku�. � however login prompt is designed very well.�"
0,Readme file doesn't have any information. Not able to login with admin credentials.
0,Could not test UI because links for signing up are broken.
0,"Although the application is deployed on Heroku and the user interface is concise and easy to use, the README file provides no information about admin account(email and password) and application features.� �"
1,"Im unable to signup as a house hunter or a realtor, so the controllers for the same have not been tested. A suggestion would be to provide details of already created users so that reviewers can atleast log in and test other functionalities."
0,Due to the lack of provided admin login and the fact that I cannot sign up for a realtor or hunter account it is impossible to evaluate the functionalities
0,"While the typical Rails files for testing were included, I did not see a complete set of tests for model and controller."
0,I am not able to sign up into the system. Neither i could see any credentials in the readme file. Hence not able to proceed further to check the above mentioned functionalities.
0,Default tests are present. Not the actual tests.�
0,no work has been done. Application throws error as soon i click on sign up button and choose any type of account.
0,Tests are added for most controllers.
0,Multiple commits are present in the repo.
0,All of the commits for this application were made on the same day.
0,"There were 4 commits on the day it was due, presumably to get the project up and running for submission and 1 today to upload the development database."
0,I see commits only on a single day .
0,All the changes are pushed at once.
0,Git�was not utilized fully. There are only a handful of commits that do not capture the development process of�project.�
0,"I looked through their github commits log, and found that their first commit is on Oct 1,2018. Maybe their just began to do the project on Oct 1?"
1,Yes. I am able to login into the system via the link provided.
1,"The user interface has a bare bones look and feel but is intuitive overall. The inquiries list is hard to find for the admin, and the links below the tables could be placed at the top of the screen to improve the UX. The inquiry component of the app had awkward navigation, particularly for the realtor. This is also awkward for the house hunter. Only one link is needed up top."
0,Sign-up for realtors and admin gives application error.�
0,The user interface is pretty intuitive. Few things like the create house functionality is breaking on heroku and giving an application error.
1,They have attached 2 other files saying what all they have implemented.
0,Everything was described properly in the README file.
1,"UI is simple to follow. Enhancements mentioned below can simplify various tasks 1. Preferred contact method can be drop down with ""text, mail, phone"" options. 2. User role can be drop down with ""buyer and realtor""."
1,"The user interface is average.� The good parts I found about UI are: 1. Error messages (while registering a new admin/house hunter/realtor/house/company) were helpful. 2. Front-end checks like mail and phone number size and type etc have been used properly. 3. Dropdown for companies while registering houses, for houses while submitting inquiruies�etc are properly implemented and easy to use. However, several very small changes would make the UI much better: 1. Allow a drop-down�when signing up as roles 2. Add inquire�a house or add a new house to interest list etc functionalituies�at the top. If house list gets a few hundred rows long, user must scroll all the way down to�access the functionalities. 3. Add message as�to why login failed. Something as simple as ""Invalid credentials"" would suffice and let user know that the login is working but the password is incorrect."
0,"No model tests were found, but a controller test was well tested."
0,I could see testing done. I could see extra test cases added.
1,"I feel the user model is well tested. The link to houses broke through realtor role on heroku. This might just be a production issue and might work well locally in the development environment. I recommend checking the heroku logs and fixing this error. Due to this error, I could not create any house for listing. Overall, I feel it is a good job and you have managed to implement most of the functionalities.  One suggestion would be :  1)����� When I try to sign-up as a user, I have to fill up the role type. This is not intuitive for a user as the user does not know what kinds of roles and their format(case sensitivity, data type etc) expected by your system. I would suggest either give a drop down for this or checkboxes which will be easy for a user to use."
0,You haven't completed this task.
0,Yes�
0,"Parts of the code is tested partially, none of the models are tested thoroughly"

0,The ruby code is precise and the project follows a proper structure with all the required files.
1,"Code is great, usage of SearchController and PotentialBuyerController shows deep understanding of rails as a framework. Great job. But I find following missing� 1. In controllers, you will need to put before_action :authenticate_user! 2. Usage of devise for user management is good.� 3. Code for Models seems to be missing, House has no entries , validations , relations etc 4. You can use rails_admin for admin account management 5. Gemfile has ref to sqlite impliescode is not deployed on heroku atleast 6. Integrations tests have been written which is good. � � �"
0,No deployed!
0,"The link for deployed project has not been provided so cannot test any features.Looking at the github codes, very little has been implemented. README file that has been provided is of no help"

0,There is no external� link provided to the application
0,16 commits in last 11 days implies have been pushing code frequently
1,very inconvenient for me to review without a deployed version!�
0,"When the project was assigned, the team didn't made much commits. But after a week and a half, they started committing on a regular basis. The frequency of commits was then linear, which is a good thing. The project didn't seem to have been completed hurriedly or at the last moment."
0,�The repo has many commits contributed by the teammates throughout� the project period
0,"I found many commits throughout the project period about fixing bugs, add new features and update readme.� �"
1,"The user interface is very well designed, and the cleanest and the most user friendly among all that I've reviewed till now. The UI is very intuitive and the alternate shading of the lists improves legibility a lot. The only place where the UI was deficient was that it didn't seem consistent. The login / signup page had a different UI compared to other pages. I suppose improving consistency would increase user friendliness of the application to a lot of extent.�"
0,User interface is very nice and well-organized.
0,readmd�has all important required details.
0,"Once any user signs in, he/she cannot log out. This is a major flaw in the workflow"
0,"This application is deployed on Heroku, and the user interface is easy to understand and use."
0,"They team has successfully followed most of the conventions of good programming principles of ruby. The schema was very detailed and cohesive, and the variables were named appropriately and effectively. The readme provided was helpful, but the project lacked in program documentation / comments, which made me to go through each line of code to make sense out of the code. Apart from that, the practices seemed good."
0,�The code is neat and concise with required comments and messages for all the changes
0,models/search.rb line 6: Don't need to use return. controllers/home_controller.rb line 2: You should use one line to define a empty method.� controllers/house_controller.rb line 34: No meaning line break. controllers/user_controller.rb line 19: No meaning line break.
0,"The team seems to have tested the login / signup module pretty well. I could hardly find any bugs there. But the team seemed to have ignored testing other modules extensively. This is because the delete functionality in many modules is not working. For example, the realtor cannot delete houses or company, neither can a house hunter delete houses from his interest list."
0,�The logout functionality does not work for any user
0,"I noticed they did generate tests for some controllers, but not enough. No tests for models.�"
0,"The code followed best practices for items such as indentation, line separation, and method naming."

0,Very nicely written code. DRY principles used nicely. Formatting is also done very nicely.
0,"Code looks, as they say, 'hella fresh'. Very clean, from the files I looked over."
0,The team has used excellent Ruby standards coding practice. Controller as well as Model has variable names which are self explanatory.�
0,"The code on Git has good readability with proper indentation and naming conventions. Similar functionalities have been combined together into a class like, in the case of PotentialBuyerController. The use of a single User model and role based authentication has certainly DRY'd up the code. One possible alternative to further DRY up the code, is that in many controllers like in the case of users_controller, every method is storing the list of real estate companies in an instance variable @real_estate_companies. So, in this case a callback like before_action can be used to save the real estate companies in @real_estate_companies variable, so that all methods have access to it.� The use of appropriate iterators instead of looping constructs like for and while follows Ruby's good coding practices. Every controller serves a specific purpose and the use of a common welcome_controller and its associated views has again modularised the code for easy extensibility.�"
0,Ruby Rails code standards are correctly followed. And code is committed properly.
1,"The user interface is very intuitive. I like the modern look and feel of the UI as well as the icons and images. It's quite professional. Excellent work! The various buttons are in good locations. The button text could be darker, however. The ""new user"" link could be made into a bigger button, which would make it more prominent. Right now it is hard to see."
0,UI has modified which is good.
0,"the interfce is very good, clean and very easy to use."
0,"Very nice UI, great UX. Great use of material design icons and bootstrap. Enjoyed using the website. Great job!"
0,"In general, UI was great. The site looks really clean, and the buttons did what I expected them to do."
0,User interface is well organized and easy to use.
0,Highly intuitive user interface. Properly states admin as well as new user login. The navebar�shows the logged in user as well as log out options. Very easy to user and understandable.�
0,"The User interface is very appealing. The show view is especially remarkable that makes good use of the attractive classes of CSS and Bootstrap. The navigation links provided in every page are very helpful to explore the website. The switch user capability makes it easy for users to switch between roles without the hassle of logging out and logging in again. One issue that I encountered was that the inquiries controller has not been fully implemented, which lands the website into an error page.�"
0,Yes The UI is interactive and easy to use.
0,"The testing was thorough, although one model and one controller individually did not appear to be tested thoroughly."
0,Modules have test cases.
0,"yes, at least one controller and one model have been tested."
0,Some test cases are missing for complicated flows like Real Estate Company should only be deleted when there are no realtors assigned.
0,"The inquiry controller was thoroughly tested, but none of the models appear to have the same amount of testing."
0,Two tests have been implemented and working.�
1,"The team has not yet started to test their models (unit test) and controller (functional and integration test). Test driven development (TDD) is a good strategy to test the application features before and during the application development phase. By using TDD, it is possible to anticipate the potential pit falls and corner cases, before starting to address the code to tackle those."
0,Hunters functionalities are working properly.
0,The team used multiple development branches and a master branch along with frequent commits to stay in sync.

0,I could see commits made my team members in timely manner.
0,Code is written properly and followed ruby framework with MVC architechure. Also added various packages.
0,Basic Practices were followed Reusability of code is maintained and the code is well intended
1,"Lot of work is done, good job.� Few suggestions from my end,� (1) Tests not implemented for both model and controller (2)�I do see� �<%= form.check_box(:role_ids, {:multiple => :true, :checked => @user.roles.map { |role| role.id }.include?(role.id) }, role.id, false) %>�but roles are not visible in UI (3)�Though images are uploaded , in house profile it is not displayed, also as I understand multiple images for house are allowed hence its incorrect to use� �has_one_attached :image_path. (4) Validations for models such a House are missing� (5) Its a good coding tech to add� : params.require in controllers� (6) In UI it is good to add in tables so that all fields are aligned� (7) you have�before_action :authenticate_user!�but in the controller tests I do not see login as part the tests. � � � � �"
1,"The team has followed good coding practices with�sufficient priority on MVC model. Each model/controller/view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code. � I am giving 3/5 because 1. The code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. Also, if the role of each model/controller/view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code. 2. DRY concept can be used to a better extent."
0,"it has a good structure, choice of names of the files is appropriate and readable"
0,"The pre-configured admin details are not mentioned on Git . Therefore, I am unable to test admin"
0,User Interface is nice. Team has tried keeping the UI as per standards and easy to access to user. They have also added validation. Team could give more clear and understandable errors.
0,"No credentials for admin available in the README. Can't access the admin section and hence cannot grade it. � Also, no roles have been defined in the signup form.

0,"The UI looks appealing and very easy to follow. The choice of layout properly differentiates various class of functionalities possible with the application. Yet the UI lacks the below aspects 1. There is no concept of user role in the signup form. Though there is role field, it always shows empty. 2. Few links in the layout are broken. 3. Few fields like the phone number can be made optional for creating users which eases the process."
0,i could not find admin credentials in read-me file� rest of the interface is good
0,Sign up for roles not available Admin credentials not provided Can not sign up as realtor/hunter from UI. Hence can not verify any of the functionalities Can not find search feature. README file is not informative. Too short.

1,"Unfortunately, I am unable to view this Git Repository. This is, most likely, due to the fact that the repo is set to private and only available to those currently collaborating. I would suggest making the setting adjustment for the repo to be public so reviewers and TA's can grade the work that has been�completed.

1,Unable to view the git repository. Git is truly your friend during development. Make a habit of really committing with useful commit messages and at appropriate feature development times. My team and I found that having different commits for each feature implementation gave many options for points in time that we could revert back to in the invent that something went awry.
1,You are following good ruby coding practices. For some places where you are comparing for example in login_controller.rb if params[:login][:email] == 'admin@admin' && params[:login][:password] == 'admin' You can use a constant file where you can write these 'admin@admin.com' and use that constant. Its not a good practice to write it like this. Otherwise everything seems good.
0,The code is as per coding practices. Nice first attempt.
0,Well structured code using MVC pattern. �Couldn't find admin credentials mentioned on readme.�
0,Looks good to me. The Ruby DRY code approach is followed throughout.
0,the github code repository is concise and well maintained. The code base follows goo Ruby and Rails coding practices. The MVC architecture skeleton is implemented in an elegant manner. The desired features need to be implemented and the security issues need to be fixed.
0,"Ruby way of writing ""if !some_condition"" is ""unless condition"" Couple of large if else structures that could be broken down."
0,easy to understand.
0,The back button is a loop. I can never traverse back to Dashboard
0,User view is easy to understand and navigate. There are certain links which don't work�and doesn't load any page. �
0,"Yes, it is very intuitive and easy to use."
0,test cases are generated through scaffold.
0,I am unable to go back to dashboard. Hence I am unable to test the functionalities of House Hunter. � The back button is a major problem.
0,only controller tested
0,"not all functionalities are working, but the once which are working are end to end tested and works fine. there are few changes which are required - Cannot create an inquiry� Cannot check the potential buyers cannot list a house cannot search a house �"
0,The team has not implemented a testing module as of yet.
0,You�are not�testing anywhere yet.
0,Test skeletons are present. Doesn't look like tests are added yet.
0,committed throughout the period to avoid merge conflicts.
0,"The functionalities have been implemented , but the back button is a major problem"
0,"yes, timely pushing of code and creation of branches to avoid merge conflict"
0,The team has a well documented history of commits for the code repository
0,You guys started pretty late. But overall great effort. Great UI.
1,"Yes, the code was written well but a lot of functionalities�related�to the session was not added."
1,"Overall the following things can be improved: 1) The primary key for the real estate company should be auto generated. This is done automatically by the rails framework, so maybe you can remove the code from the view which asks for the user to select the primary key while creating a company. 2) Whenever there is a reference to a foreign key in a model, you can validate and use that reference by following the format model_id, where model is the entity of your foreign key. Eg. If house has foreign key of realtor, realtor is the entity of your foreign key, hence you can reference the realtor as realtor_id in your house model. This is because rails follows convention over configuration, and this is the naming convention with respect to foreign keys."
0,good coding style.
0,Navigation between pages is not defined well.�
0,Login page is not available. Also back navigation from any page is not present. Very difficult for user to come back to the last page visited.
0,"The user interface is very pimitive. The team could have done much more. They have not designed it very well. Although I was not looking for graphics, but the element placement could have been much more improved.�"
1,"The user interface is done as it would be in a basic ruby application, which is good. There is no login functionality, this is mentioned in the README which was helpful. Some functionalities which could be improved are :  1)���� 1)� When I try to add a new house hunter from admin, I get a Contact Method is not included in the list error. As a user, I don�t know what kind of values your system is expecting in this field, so it might help to probably provide a dropdown selection element and put in your values there. In this way, the user will always select a value which your system is expecting. If there are a finite number of values, you can just hard code them into the html element, else pick it up from the db and populate your dropdown as such. 2)����� 2) When I click on back from the new househunter url, I am directed to show all house hunters url. You could improve this by updating the link-to for this back button by providing it with the user_url, or you could detect which is the current user logged in (Realtor/House Hunter/ Admin) and accordingly redirect to that role�s home page url."
1,"The login page is not made. All the admins information is listed on the first page which should not be allowed. It was difficult to understand if I was under the admin's page, realtor's or hunter's page."
0,"Deployed on Heroku. Interface is not friendly, but thr README file explained some of it."
0,Decent coding practice
0,"The app's indentation, method names, and line separation seem to match solid Ruby style guidelines."
0,From what I see it seems to be following the practice we have been using in class
0,"�Yes, the source code follows expected RoR style. The directory names and project structure also follow RoR conventions. Good job!"
1,The code base is very well written and commented. The code has been done with good coding practices. The only point to note would be to update the Readme to be more informative.
0,Good Rails coding practice has been implemented. In Model as well Controller we can see variables names that shows the relation to overall module and model.�
1,"The user interface is nice. I suggest you move the search button in the houses screen to the left. Also, ""yes"" and ""no"" would probably be more user-friendly than ""true"" and ""false"" for the basement condition. The new user window was very intuitive and powerful. Note: I found a bug in this window: changing the admin account with ""REALTOR"" checked causes an error. The error screen was graceful, however. Also, please use radio buttons for ""HUNTER"" or ""REALTOR"", not checkboxes. Please also include the type of the user in the users window."
1,The UI is quite good but the design can be improved. The application allows a realtor to add company details while signing up which does not make for great design. Without authentication no user should be allowed to perform any functionality.
0,No CSS has been applied. Links are redirecting to pages instead of just performing the action
0,"�the links tell you what page you will go to or what action you will do. It's not pretty, but it works enough"
1,"�UI is easy to use, but not well described in the README. Please add brief Test Cases to demonstrate expected functionality."
1,The interface is basic and no extra styling is done. But overall the web application is easy and intuitive to use. The Read me� file of the github repo should be updated to make it more � detailed to use. �
0,"The interface is intuitive. Specially, they have very good form structure for realtor as well as new users, and house hunters.�"
0,It appears minimal controller testing has been performed.
0,No tests have been written for the application
0,"No testing, but at least they mentioned it in the readme."
0,No testing module found!
0,The team used mutliple branches and many commits throughout the project to increment on the codebase.
1,"While the team did push changes to the project, there are 95 commits which are unnecessary. Instead of pushing every change to the final project, the team could have combined a few of the changes and pushed them all at once to make for better record of the changes made."
1,Teams looks fairly active but the project progress does not correspond to the number of commits made in the git repository
0,�They have a lot of commits so they were always working on it
0,"Yes, it looks like sizable commits were made before the 24th."
0,Yes 95 commits.�

0,Couldn't find any issues respective to Style Guidelines
1,"The User Interface was working as described in the README file.� The UI functionality don't have any issues apart from the one noted in additional comments If team would have given some assets/stylesheets config,� The UI would have been great on the looks as well"
0,Did not see a SPEC folder in the GIT
0,There were 9 commits overall in the GIT
0,"The code follows the good coding�practices. However, there are some instances where I found commented lines of code in the controller. Ex. house_hunters_controller.rb�lines 23-25 and users_controller.rb�function switch_role"
0,"The user interface is quite intuitive to use. I had a very minor suggestion. I found a case where the go back link was missing and thus, I had to click on the dashboard link to go back. Ex. After I click on view companies, there's�no go back link.� Overall, I feel you did a really good job. For example, while switching the role, you gave an option to edit the roles as well. As well as a delete account functionality.�"
0,companies_controller along with a few other controllers are populated with the tests generated by scaffolding. No tests in models found.
0,All commits were found to be done on a single day. i.e. October 1.
1,"The team has a proper concern on MVC model. Each model/controller/view has a specific role which has not been repeated in other parts of the code. � Still, I am giving 3/5 because 1. The project has neglected DRY principle in many of the instances.�This has resulted in a bulkier code. 2. As many authors�say, a code looks good if it appears like reading a novel. This appearance of a novel like look is missing in many places which can grab other user's attention. 3. The code would have better readability if sufficient amount of comments are included in the code. Also, if the role of each model/controller/view is documented in the code file at the beginning then other contributors may feel easy to follow the code."
1,"The README file is developed to include all the necessary details about the project as a whole. Great work on documenting. The UI is simple with properly designed tabs. Few enhancements could include 1. The back button is missing in a few places which might be useful for easier navigation. 2. While creating a company, if size is modelled as a drop down to take a range of values then UI would be simpler."
0,"The team has tested parts of different models, but none of the models is thoroughly tested for functionality verification."
1,"I can see that there are multiple commits on a single day. This might imply that team members have worked remotely without using git. Suggestions: 1. Make complete use of git when working remotely. 2. Keep pushing changes periodically to avoid any code loss and to have a timeline of changes. 3.�Commit message carries great importance for the first level of code change analysis. So this has to explain the changes to a decent extent. Commit messages in this repository is vague; if they are meaningful, it reduces some effort in analysing the code timeline."
0,"Very nice code, and almost every functions that test required are finished."
0,the interface is easy to use and it is wll described in the Readme file.
0,the test for controller and model has been done. and all the details have been included into the Readme file.
0,Good set of directions in readme.
0,Most of it default UI provided by rails but is easy to use.
0,Basic functionality seems to be working. But no explicit test cases found.
0,There were continuous code pushes.�
0,You guys started pretty late seeing from your commit history.
0,Most of the commits were early this week.
0,well done work except the lack of search� the README file and the UI is not so good� anyway It's a good work!�
0,Only basic validations have been implemented. Tests generated through scaffold are available.
1,Testing for controllers has been completed. Unfortunately test cases for models were not worked on. A suggestion could be to test validation of inquiry if corresponding realtor or house hunter gets deleted.
0,You haven't implemented testing yet. I didn't find anything in test files. Probably you'll do it in the next phase.�
0,house hunter functionalties are chacked but there is scope for improvement
0,"Multiple controllers are thoroughly tested, but no models appear to be properly tested."
0,Could not find commits for Test files.
0,"Several of the required functionalities are available, though many links are not working."
1,"Links to create new functionalities are all in place and working perfectly. However, I would like to suggest the overall redirection of the user to various places in the app would greatly improve user experience as using the back button again and again in the browser tends to become irritating after a while."
0,"Its deployed on heroku, but haven't written about what all features you have completed and what all features are left to complete. Also there are few pages where you can add a link to go to main menu. Sometimes I have to go back 3-4 times to reach main menu."
0,"The user interface is very confusing. It is difficult to get to the sign up page to begin with, and then the messages Isrealtor and Ishousehunter are cryptic to actual users (anyone other than computer scientists). It is very difficult to follow where the links take you on the website and what exactly you are looking at at any given moment."
1,"You are following good coding practice. I have a suggestion that you can move realtors, admin and house hunters as childs of user. That is admin belongs to user, realtor belongs to user etc. Currently you have all the information in user model."
0,"While the code is organized well and seems to follow the Model View Controller design pattern, the project doesn't seem to make good use of the relational database. There are multiple models/controllers (specifically the list of potential buyers) that are not necessary at all because of the relational database."
0,UI is fine but cannot access readme file
1,Comments and indentation at a couple of places can be update.
0,"house_hunter_accounts_controller.rb line 28: meaningless line break. house_list_controller.rb line 8,98: meaningless line break. realtor_accounts_controller.rb line 28: meaningless line break. session_controller.rb line 6,19,20: Wrong indentations, line 9: No parentheses. user_controller.rb line 13:meaningless line break, line 52: No parentheses. �"
0,Have used DRY principles. Follows good coding practices.
0,"Yes the UI is good and easy for navigation, usage."
0,Readme needs to be updated. UI looks good but UX can be worked upon.� �
1,"Application is deployed on Heroku, but the user interface does not compliant with the requirement(your home page contains house information and search function before user signing in). Also it is not described in the README file."
0,The UI is good and intuitive. Good use of colors and html features.
0,"Yes, tests are done for many models and controllers."
0,"Test skeleton present. However, tests can be made in depth."
1,Basic tests are written. Could improve by adding specific application logic.
0,Yes there are lot of commits over many days from multiple contributors
0,"Yes, there are many commits which added new features and fixed some bugs.�"
0,"Yeah, they have done the project with even number of commits throughout the duration."
0,"The link provided is not working. So, no way of finding out"
0,"UI is easy to understand, but problematic to use.� Admin must use user ids to create hunters or realtors or inquiries and the display is via user�IDs too. Signup page redirect to show all signed up users. From there, any one who is not logged in can delete users. Same user can be added as house hunter any number of times with separate entries. No validations are added (I can choose role no. 5 for signup), and no error messages have been provided. Passwords are in plain text. In some cases, wrong notices are displayed - create user with wrong info gives ""User account was successfully created. AAA!"" which is incorrect as user was not actually created.� Back to your page links do not work"
0,There is no code apart from a basic scaffold generated.� Commit ID Reviewed :�7fe864078b219bebacc0046b8f45c6e25cc1544c
0,"The database schema only consisted of the users table, and the CRUD functionalities on the MVC related to it. Due to the less amount of content to review, a proper justification for this question is a bit tough. Even though the amount of code was less, but it followed many of the good coding practices of ruby on rails, except a few. For example, he code lacked any sort of documentation or comments. It makes it tough for the reviewer or any other programmer to make sense of the code. But apart from that, the practices seemed fine. The variables were named appropriately, functions were named effectively, and the classes were defined definitely.�"
0,In test.html.erb you shoud not write code like this:�<%= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id]).name %>
0,The code follows mvc architecture and practices in an organized way
0,"There is not much implementation by the team, hence I cannot comment much on it"
1,"Only user model in app/models, rest of the models such as house, realtor, real estate company are missing Same with controllers. � In user model, could add validation for email format� � I would suggest user gem 'devise' for user management and 'rails_admin' for admin functionality.� This helps as the gems taking control of implementation and the developers can concentrate on business logic �If back is clicks on user edit , the user is logged out instead of going to profile page�"
1,"As this project is in the early stages of development, the UI is minimal. The title is prominently displayed as a header on the home page and subsequent pages to clearly indicate what this application is ""Real Estate manager"". The login and signup links are clear as to purpose; however, the intent in the presence of the words ""Hello World"" beside�them is unclear. Additionally, the login and signup page functionalities are easily interpreted. I would suggest that the user profile actually display what kind of user they are rather than a number that only has meaning to the system, as well as, a log out link/button in the header for a user as he/she traversed your application. The README file only contains the fact that there is no pre-configured administrator. I would recommend including the suggested context from the Ruby generator and the project write up."
0,"The interface was very easy and simple to use, and was very user friendly, but it lacked intuitiveness on some levels. Also, the readme file didn't state anything about the UI.�"
0,Apart from the login functionality nothing is done. Commit ID :�7fe864078b219bebacc0046b8f45c6e25cc1544c
0,"For sign up, I don't understand what is the difference between ""I am shopping for a house"" and ""I am a realtor and I am shopping for a house"".�"
0,"The README file isn't as descriptive as it should be. And UI is not very well designed. Printing ""Hello World"" on the home page seems to be a debugging strategy but it needs to be removed. And proper links needs to be inserted. Example: Link of 'Logout' is not present"
0,Only user/realtor login has been implemented yet. Other functionality is missing. README stated that admin has not been configured.�
0,"The user interface looks intuitive, as it has options for signing up with different roles"
1,"The UI is simple however, because of the lack of functionality cannot be assessed properly. One suggestion�would be to�rename the label of 'back' button to 'logout'�to make it�more intuitive."
0,No tests have been written
0,NO I don't think they have submitted any test model.
0,They have tested for the models and controllers constructed.
0,"No, all tests are missing�"
0,I couldn't find any test method�other than the one in the sessions_controller_test class.
1,"The code follows ruby and rails convention, but there are�multiple commented files in the project such as logins.coffee and many more which have not been used in the application.�"
0,Seem to be following standard practices.
1,"The database schema, especially for the login / signup functionality is very well implemented, and includes lots of features that weren't asked for at the first place. So the extra hard-work is very well appreciated. The db design is very cohesive and seems fool-proof. The rest of the programs and the functionalities follow most of the principles for good ruby on rails coding practices. But, the one thing I find missing was the lack of proper documentation within the code. Given the short time frame, not having extensive documentation and comments within the code is excusable, but there were certain points where I had to go through the whole code to realize what;s happening, which could have been avoided if there was proper commenting inside the code.�"
0,"Yes, the code has the parameters well defined for all the users and has the correct MVC Layout as expected.� For instance, they seem to have created separate MVC architectures for Houses, Inquiries, Interests, Companies and Users. This goes to show that they have a layered approach on access and privileges.� Also, the code is written in a very clean and formatted style with the variable definitions to be self-explanatory of the functionalities they perform.�"
1,"The team has followed good ruby coding practices. All the code is neatly written and well indented. However, the code has no comments."
1,"The user interface lack multiple navigation functionalities such as it does have any cancel or back button.�So, if a user tries to move back or cancel while creating a company, he would be stuck and would not be able to move to any other tab."
0,Good job done here! You have listed the features available to test.
0,"Admin credentials in README file not working therefore not able to test admin part. UI is confusing, there are multiple success messages displayed. Only ids are displayed in house list and no other info"
1,"The user interface looks pretty, is clean and intuitive. But the placement of menu buttons was rather ""not-obvious"". It took time for me to figure out login / signup buttons, and I also had to actively look for buttons to perform actions after signing-in, which isn't actually much user friendly. Though it may seemed cliche, but I think it is very user-friendly to have action buttons on the content of the web-page, rather than having them at the top inside the header. But apart from that, the simplicity and the look and feel was pretty good."
1,"It is surely a very intuitive user interface because the ease of navigation is generally very well defined and the routes.rb file in git hub makes the session linkage explicit.� Even, so one does fail to understand the empty blanks on their login page since there aren't any blanks at all. So, we get easily confused on what to do. Sign up is not validated for any functionality be it user or admin or realtor and we don't know what to do.� Luckily, the README File does resolve the dilemma and help us to follow the steps.�"
0,The app is deployed very well and is very easy to use.
0,"All the basic features implemented for admin,house hunter and realtor is functional. �"
0,"No, testing portion of the code seems empty. No testing has been done"
1,"The login / signup module has lots of bugs. Like when a user tries to create an account with an already existing username, the application crashes. Also, a user cannot signup as both, a realtor and a househunter. Moreover, there isnt any validtion for the length of phone number, nor the validation for the email address is correct. (for example, it accepts aa@a as a valid email address). So yes, these functionalities in the login signup module could be improved, and these does not seem thoroughly tested. But the search functionality for the houses seemed to work pretty well, and as expected."
1,"Well, we can say that they have indeed tested the models they have defined in their README file on GitHub. The definitions of the functionalities in the 'db' folders and the controllers folder makes it very easy to follow how they have structured the code. Also, the way the houses are added, the redirection the houses to the links such as CMU and NCSU websites is very intuitive and well thought out, and thus barring out a few minor mistakes in linking and page definitions the code has a good ability to run for the defined cases specially for the Admin to be failsafe. Only, one complaint though, the whole structure does crumble when one sees that they have allowed the admin to be DELETED. This is their biggest loophole.�"
0,"Although scafolded code exists, there are no testcases written"
0,There are 67 commits made during the tenure of the project by all the team members. The team has worked on git since the start of the project.
0,"Yes, 67 commits. It seems they have been pushing changes regularly"
0,"Yes, the commits were regular. After the project was assigned, there were several commits on a weekly basis, and as the deadline neared, the frequency of the commits kept increasing in an orderly manner. There was no last minute rush, and the development of the project seemed pretty well planned."
0,"Yes, as seen from the number of commits on each section of their GitHub profile, not only have they meticulously made a number of changes on Repo, but they have also updated what all changes they made against the files. This is a very neat practice in my opinion and shows that they have put ample effort to structure the code. Moreover, they have updates the GemFile multiple times so as to make it run for the Heroku app which is a must thing to do and a challenge we faced too.�"
0,"Yes, there are git commits and pushes after initial commit as well."
0,"While the application has a similar�layout as a typical Rails application, I noticed there were no�migrations in the DB. Also, the README was not formatted very well and didn't tell me much about how to install the project locally."
0,The code seems to be following the examples in cookbook app.
0,"The code follows on the lines of good ruby on rails practices. However, I can see no migrations in the db folder. The readme file contains sql statements for table completion which look to be correct."
0,"�The source code and project structure seems fine, but most of it still looks scaffold generated. RoR conventions have been maintained."
0,Yes. Timely commits with comments.
0,The code written was clear and I believe that it follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices to a certain extent.
0,It is done well and I can say it is a indeed a good ruby and rails coding practice

1,"There are some indentation issues, but otherwise the code has method names in line with convention over configuration and the spacing and line spacing are reasonable. Also, IDs should not be on the UI. The house hunters and realtors should not have to sign in after signing up."
0,There are a lot of not-so-important comments in the controllers. And a lot of DRY code
0,"This team has done a good job of following Rails conventions. There are DB migrations, common layouts of the application structure and proper use of ActiveRecord helpers."
0,The code seems very good. And the code is very clearly.
0,The Git code did follow the good coding practices using Ruby and Rails.�
0,"All files they provided are clearly structured, especially for the routes file. They provide clear routes for different conditions."
1,"The user interface has a very basic look and feel. The sign up links being on every page is not ideal. There should only be a log out link. Also, the company in the realtor page is showing the id, not the company's name. I suggest you use a drop down menu for the preferred contact of the house hunter who is signing up. It would be much more intuitive to have a single sign-in page for all users. There were also missing back buttons."
0,Yes. The UI is easy to use. But the dashboard could be made better . As every task is written on the same line
0,"While links and navigation were generally easy to find, several links rendered broken pages and several got stuck in a loop asking me to log in as an Admin to edit a user when I was already�logged in.�"
0,"For all user, sign up and log in should at the same place."
0,"The UI had good directives between operations, functionalities and was easy to use. The admin profile was available in the README file."
0,"The readme file is blank, so I cannot get access to the admin functions. The user interface is clear but not so well-structured. For example, the title appears after the different choices. And all the choices are list in a single line."
1,"While a thorough controller test exists, there is no model test."
1,The admin model performed mostly all the required specifications. The realtor and house hunter models could be made better.
1,"Yes, there were some improvements that I noticed while testing the site features in the review duration which included modifications to view list of all houses created by company of which realtor is a part. The program has scope for minimal improvements to make it function as needed."
1,"Of the functionality the team have tried to to implement, the code quality is not poor. However, the arrangement of code is difficult to understand given that not all functionalities seem to have been implemented. The ""def after_sign_in_path_for"" function in the applications controller used by the devise gem, only takes realtor as a resource, I would advise using an if or case condition within the function to allow other users to login. Also, I was unable to find any implementation for making sure that only the inquiries specific to a real estate company be visible to a realtor, and similarly only the inquiries posted by a house hunter themselves be visible to the house hunter on that specific house. I would again suggest using some If or case statements in the show function of the inquiries controller to establish identity of current_user.�"

0,Lot of unnecessary directories are created in 'controller'
0,Code is written in a clean and readable way. There are separete methods for separate tasks.� Good naming convention is followed throughout the project.
1,"The code is clean and readable. Every method handles only one task. However there are two controllers for house hunters and realtors which I felt was redundant. These could have been merged and written in a single controller. There is no bad naming in the project, they have followed the naming conventions. There are no long methods. Methods have been written concisely and in a readable way."
0,The team seems to have attempted to add to their functionality from the previous round. They have attempted to use the devise gem for allowing multiple user logins. It seems that they created a new git repo and started from the beginning which seems like a fair idea given that they wanted to use devise instead of implementing the user registration/sessions.�

1,"The belongs_to and has_many conditions have been set by the team on the model.rb files. But there are no foreign indexes on schema.db file. I would advise using; Model foreignModel_id:dataType:index with scaffold generate to add a foreign key and in case of devise generated tables I suggest creating a foreign key with a new migration.

0,"Yes, there is a ""has_many"" relationship in company model, and also realtor is able to create mutliple house in one company."
1,From the Code DB Design looks fine. They have handled most of the relationships properly. Although I believe having different tables for admins/realtors/hunters/users/roles and role maps is un-necessary and just increases the complexity of the system.�
0,"The relationship between house hunter, realtor and companies have been well established."
0,"The AWS deployment attempted by the team does not work. I attempted to clone the repository and run it locally but was unable to. Looking at the code itself, I was able to determine that the wishlist, replying to an inquiry functionalities are missing.� I am unsure why the team opted use the devise model generator for the companies model. The companies aren't a type of user on this project from my understanding and rather a resource. Would it be possible for the team to use a scaffold generate instead?"
0,"They got pretty much every basic functions in the app. But I am not sure where should I login as an admin. and there are some small bugs. There will display two ""logout"" button after you login as a hunter. Back does not work well.�"
0,"I cannot access the link provided by the team. Since this is hosted on AWS, I believe they have not opened the Ip to public by mistake (I have worked with AWS before and this happens). Maybe they worked from Library or their house, and when you spawn an instance in AWS it adds the IP from where the instance is spawned to the access list, which is why I am not able to access this from my IP. This can also be a problem with the proxy server setup in the instance and since you guys are maybe doing ssh into the server to deploy your code, the default HTTP request will go to port 80 and wont be forwarded to 8080 unless explicitly specified in apache/nginx and will block the requests. Easier way would be to host the app on heroku which handles all this automatically and provides you with a DNS entry"

Though not major, a suggestion for the team is to avoid using pronouns or subjective references such as�my_interest_list and houses_posted_by_me for method naming.

Most of these relations are bi-directional associations, so there should ideally have been a belongs_to relation.

0,The quality of the code is reasonably good. Would it be possible for the team to avoid using the little interpretable ruby they use in the html files and instead use the controllers and its helpers for writing all logic?
0,"While Trying to delete a real estate company with existing realtors, the system is failing."
0,Handles most of the edge cases properly. There are some bugs related to Messages as i could not test it properly. In some cases deleting a user or a company fails.
1,"Overall the code is written in an extremely clean and readable way. Having said that I would like to propose one suggestion which may help in future. There's 2 instances where code has been added in the index function of controllers (namely houses_controller.rb & list_of_pot_buyers_controller.rb). After the if else condition if search exists or not, the main search logic in houses_controller.rb could be added to a new function by passing the search params to that function. Similarly in list_of_pot_buyers_controller.rb, the SQL queries should be put in other functions say ""def generate_list_of_potential_buyers"""
0,"I think the code is well written. The function calls are very well done. It is neat and easily readable. Also, there is no bad naming the project. Code very well follows the DRY approach."
1,"Unfortunately, all the edge cases in the given question are failing  The system encounters an error while deleting a real estate company After changing the real estate company, the realtor can still delete the house that he had created with a previous company Even after deleting the user from the dashboard, the queries submitted by the users are not deleted There was no potential buyers list available for viewing even after adding houses to the interest list myself  These cases could be seen upon and improved"
0,The code is clean and easily understood. A separate controller for adding the buyers to the potential buyer list is created. Overall the structure and naming of controllers and migration file is clear and the respective functionalities can be identified based on the names. The team has done good work on that
0,"The code itself is fairly clean and readable. The class ListOfPotentialBuyers is poorly named, and I'm not sure you need a separate class for it."
0,Function calls are added. Code is formatted and neat. Naming conventions are followed.
0,"1. the realtors also got deleted its a pass 2.switches successfully 3.previous company house cannot be removed inquires, will not get deleted with the removed house hunter"
0,Several linear commits visible on the git. Most of the work done in round 2 is fixes and additional functionalities on top of the base that was finished before round 1.
0,The team promptly handled the task by working on it regularly and committing changes frequently.
0,"I was unable to judge if this works -there was no way for me to determine that. The admin can not delete companies, can not view, edit or delete realtors or househunters. Also, users cannot delete themselves.� Further, the third party admin gem or module� used does not let me edit or delete users or companies either - it gives an error on heroku.� Thus, I was unable to determine if the edge cases work. Also README does not specify anything."
0,"By looking at their github page, I could see they submitted their changes actively and also they continued submitting changes in round 2 as well."
0,"most the things are done in phase 2 only. but few things are missing. house hunter can't edit/delete his inquiry. no page for house hunter to see what all he has marked as interested. Not able to figure out as a house hunter if i have marked a house interested or not. realtor not . able to reply to inquiry, its throwing error."
0,The team submitted the changes at equal intervals of time and the last commit was performed a day prior to the deadline which is commendable.

0,"Yes, there are 60 commits. Well done."
0,Yes they have implemented unit tests as well as functional tests.
1,"It seems evident that there are deletion issues for any resource/user that is already indexed on some other resource/user. The solution to that issue would be��adding a destroy dependency in model files, for example for house hunters,�has_many�:inquiries,�dependent::destroy"
0,�The team has done an impressive job in handling the tests for messages and real estate companies.
0,"1. houses stillshow up after deleting company 2. when a realtor switches companies, their old listed house still shows up and is editable 3. no potential buyer list"
0,yes i can see a variety of edge cases being tested
1,"Tests have been implemented for a model and a controller. However, I believe that they are not exhaustive. Only one test case which will succeed has been implemented. You should try to implement more test cases, like what happens when one of the things which is mandatory is absent. Further, I am afraid that the tests are not testing the correct thing. For eg,�should create real_estate_company tests� assert_redirected_to ""/real_estate_companies/#{r.id}"" while it should be testing if the company can be saved."
1,"User Role-: Once a user is created, and goes to edit their profile, if they uncheck both roles there is no way for that user to get any role back. Their should be a check in the user table that both roles cannot be blank. Also, unfortunately there is no mention of how the system handles edge cases in the Readme file"
0,"1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists. � 2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses. � 3) If admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list."
0,if a company is deleted the realtor and houses doesn't get deleted. and if a house gets deleted the inquires are not getting deleted.
0,"Unfortunately most of the edge cases fail.  The houses of the realtors are listed even after deleting the real estate company. Also the realtors list display the realtors associated with the deleted real estate company. The realtor is able to access the houses owned by old real estate companies after changing their own real estate company After deleting a user, the inquiries continue to be listed"
0,"This system is not properly linked together. Real Estate companies are not required to list houses, realtors can see and respond to all inquiries from everyone, creation of inquiries is not linked to a specific house."
0,"One thing is that once the company that a realtor belongs to was destroyed, he or she can also list houses, and that should be reconsidered."
0,The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of comments and clear naming. 1. Adding the remove from wish list feature is a�plus�point. 2. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and�plural nouns for models and controllers. 3. No�problem with respect to the coding clarity.�
0,"The quality of the code is impeccable. Use of helper files and establishing a specific user through ""def current_user"" function in the application helper allowed the team to use a common user parameter throughout the application development and reduced the amount of�effort that would have been needed other wise.�"
0,�Code is very much readable. There are proper comments before the functions.

0,COde quality seems to be very good. Documentation aloong with instructions are present.
0,Mapping has been properly implemented.
0,The database design is close to perfect. The destroy and delete dependencies have also been well managed to allow deletion in cases where a house hunter gets deleted and all its inquiries are deleted automatically.
0,"�Yes, the system does handle the relationships and the mappings are clearly defined."
0,I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems.�
0,This system handle the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships
0,"The code on Github has 1-to-n relationship between real estate company and realtor. It also facilitates realtors to create real estate companies of their own. My doubt is whether the realtor can view, update and delete the real estate company created by him, because I could not find such a functionality implemented in the application as well as the code."
1,"Kind off. I felt that admin should have been able to delete the company irrespective of the realtors belonging to the company. I felt that that scenario should have been handled in one of the following ways:- 1. Realtor associated to the company should be deleted, obviously not preferable. 2. Realtor continues to exist but without the company and thereby no houses or inquiries assigned to him."
0,The above case is covered.
0,The realtors controller has been very well tested by the team.
0,�The test cases are running fine. Clear steps for the same are given in the readme.
0,Excellent use of Rspec.

0,The team has done a good job in submitting changes throughout the project. The team has not committed changes in Round 2.
0,Very good commiting by entire team. Project was handled well and not messy.
1,"Same issues as of first review. Cannot delete company. Reason cited is 'dependent realtor exist'. I suggest that when a company is removed, realtor shouldn't have a company too. Because a realtor can exist without a company in his profile too! Admin cannot edit his/her details"
0,The system has no perceivable issues.
0,�Functionalities are working fine. They are well documented in a separate pdf file as well. Even the read me contains clear instructions for setup.
0,"I could not find the filters tab in the show houses section for the house hunter. Rest, everything looks great."
0,Most of the functionalities are working correctly. One necessary feature that is not working as expected is inquiries. There are broken links when admin/realtor tries to view inquiries.
0,Almost every feature is working as it's supposed to.
0,App as a whole works very well. The look and feel of it is also very good. Contributes to a very good overall user experience.
1,"Cannot delete company. Reason cited is 'dependent realtor exist'. Realtor is able to delete�houses that he created when he was in company A, after changing to company B. When hunter is deleted by admin and inquiries are checked, the page doesnt show up. (deployment error) � Edge cases Company cannot be created without filling all details. This is implemented. Session control : When user signs out from a page and then goes back, the profile page should not be shown (as he is signed out). This should be considered."
0,The system was able to pass all listed test cases. All the views have been perfectly setup as well and have disabled buttons where needed.
0,�There are enough edge cases tested and well documented in the attached pdf file. Could also view the some points to be taken care that are documented in specific cases.
0,"The only thing I had trouble with was changing from a house hunter to a realtor and back. It's possible I just missed the option. In my opinion, that is a rather insignificant omission."
0,"1) If the admin tries to delete a real estate company which has some realtors and houses, it would not delete the record, because a dependent realtor exists. 2) The realtor can change his real estate company and he won't be prohibited from removing houses. 3) If�admin tries to delete a house hunter who has submitted several inquiries, the inquiries will be deleted and house hunter will be removed from the buyers' list."
0,"1. When admin tries to delete real estate company that has realtors and house hunters in it, there is an error that says 'Cannot delete record because of dependent realtors'. Since real estate company is a foreign key in the realtor table, the system does not allow the deletion of real estate companies that have realtors under it. 2. When a realtor changes his real estate company, the houses that are listed by him are unaffected. The system also allows the realtor to delete houses listed in the previous company. 3. I was unable to view inquiries after logging in as admin, hence I am not able to inspect the condition of submitted inquiries after the hunter who created the inquiries has been deleted."
0,Test case 1 could have been handled better.

0,Looks decent.
0,"The code in this project generally appears to be readable. Home controller should probably have a different name, just because controllers are generally supposed to be plural, but there is only one home in their website. Their house search controller appears to be in the model section of the project though."
1,"It would be more modular if realtors, house hunters and admin were a different table. Since they are clubbed under users table, there are many checks performed in most of the views. Cannot identify user names, company names as IDs are displayed. It would be helpful if this can be modified."
0,Coding standards are followed properly�
0,Yes. The team kept pushing commits through out the duration of the project. The team even kept pushing commits during round 2.�Though it seems like only 2 of the team members did the majority of work.
0,Yes they did commit changes in round 2. But it seems only one person has contributed in a group of 3
0,This team continued pushing changes throughout the project.
0,The team kept on committing on the regular bases but�needed team collaboration. Mostly commits are from one person.
0,"The readme file is completed and explicit, so great!"
0,"Foreign key integration is been done in DB, but as there are no separate active records for user types(hunter, realtor,admin) hence the 1-1,1-many relations are absent."
0,The mappings are present and clearly defined
0,inquiry doesn't seem to belong to a house and there is no table for potential buyes
0,The relationships appear to be documented correctly here.
0,Some of the missing relationships I identified: 1. Company has_many houses 2. House has_many inquiries 3. Realtor has_one company
0,Active record relationships are missing. All the relations are implemented�through code logic.
0,Could not add a company as a realtor. Also could not attach and display a picture when listing a house. When signing up as house hunter was asked to select a real estate company. The house Interest /interest list feature �has not been implemented. Also the inquiry is not associated with a listed house. Cannot delete real estate companies.

0,Most of the functionalities seem to work fine. Below are some of them which break or are absent: 1.Link to view current user's company breaks and there is nothing to show. 2. There is no option to change a user's company. 3. There is no interest list for a house hunter. 4. There is no potential buyer's list for a listing.
0,Basic functionalities are working fine.
0,Could not test most of the edge cases as functionalities have not been implemented.

0,Deleting a company doesn't delete houses.Deleting househunter doesn't his/her inquiries.
0,Validations are properly provided to handle edge cases
0,A realtor changing real estate company makes them unable to edit houses they've listed with the previous company.
0,"1. This test fails, as corresponding houses and realtors are not deleted. 2. The realtor's current company is not visible (feature break), thus it fails. 3. This test case fails as inquiry of the user is not deleted.�"

1,"1. If the company that a realtor belongs to is deleted, his or her company will be the admin company, which I think may nit be the best choice. The company can be empty and in that case, the realtor should nit be able to list a house. 2. The inquiry should be able to show the hunter's name, not the code string."

0,Missing many functionalities for realtor and house hunter such as login.
0,"The admin account is created in the user model instead of the database seeds file. Other than that, the project looks pretty good code wise."
1,"Code looks okay, but I found few features missing. As far as code is concerned found admin details hard coded in the code, this is a wrong way to do.� �Could have used tables for better alignment � �"
0,"The code is very modular and clean. There is no bad naming in the project, naming conventions are followed. All the methods are concise. There are not many nested blocks and the code is clear and easy to understand. However the functionality of creating a house is written under inquiry which makes it difficult for the user to comprehend the flow of the website."
0,code is compliant to rails coding style
0,I'm afraid the code is not well organized because the functions are not working properly.
0,Nearly all commits occurred during round 2.
0,Yes they did.
0,It seems like almost all changes were made on one day for part 2 of the project.
0,Found commits only near the deadlines.
0,"The team has committed changes after round one. However, there are less number of commits and are not spread throughout the life of the project. A single commit is used for various functionalities which makes it difficult to understand the exact functionality changes. The commit messages are not appropriate which makes it harder to find out what the fix is about. There are commits even after the round 2 deadline."
0,None of the models specify any belongs_to or has_many relationship and no migrate nor schema stores an official reference to be used.
0,The inquiries aren't linked to house hunters.

For ex: The link ""new houses"" in the house list redirects to the� users/edit link. Its a minor issue which could be looked upon. The layout of the homepage for house-hunter can be fixed as links overlap each other. Also, the houses list shows edit/destroy options for the entire house list, that's a bug which needs fixing."

0,App crashes if I test any of these mentioned cases
1,"Admin cannot delete real estate companies, users or houses. I found that admin can delete these if they are not related to anything else, i.e. if there is a house which is not present in interest list, has no inquiries than it can be deleted. Ditto others. I suspect that the error is thrown as the entry is being referenced in some other table as foreign key.

1,"The admin is unable to destroy a real estate company due to the above mentioned dependency bug on the model files.

Navigation in this app was difficult.� There were not very intuitive links. There were too many clicks to add/remove Interest. The Inquiries listing gave me an error.� This app did not keep track of my session very well. The search Houses only had one ""filter"""
1,"1) If a house hunter is interested in a house, there should be only one entry specifying this interest in the database. In this app, the same house hunter can show multiple interests on the same house. This results to duplicates in db and must be handled. 2) After creating an inquiry, clicking on the Back link on the page should re-direct to /houses or which ever page was visited before creating an inquiry. This is not happening. 3) Founded year field of the company table takes any numeric value ---�Founded:�465789 4) The house hunter is able to create a company which is not supposed to be an allowed operation. This happens when as a house hunter, I edit profile and choose to be realtor, I get an option to create a company but even without changing the role to realtor. �5) Point 3 holds good for built year field of house table�Builtyear:�7598 6) View inquiries feature is not working...throws an error."

0,Admin not able to delete houses or users or companies. Unable to test a few cases due to these issues. Realtor not able to delete houses. Error page is getting displayed.
0,Edge cases not handled properly. Company delete crashing until all realtors and houses under it are deleted. House delete crashes until all inquiries on it are deleted.
0,Enquiries hasnt been tested.
0,Tested for a realtor account. The code handles the lifecycle�of the user pretty well.�
0,"Yes, they tested the user_controller and model"
0,Cant see a rspec folder.
0,Test cases in user model present.
0,Thorough testing has been done for user_test.rb and controllers.
0,They test 7 different controllers and 7 different models. Vert convincing work.
1,"Code is written properly. Simple and clean Every function is simple and has distinguishing work. Did not understand the need of creating MVC for search, photos separately.� Many functionalities could have been merged together and made a defined solution. Eg house search function could have been added in House MVC."
1,"Yes, the changes were committed throughout, but the commit messages�could�be a bit more descriptive."
1,"In general, the code of this system is clean and readable, but there are some problems in it. For example, author didn't handle the interest list properly. When a realtor wants to see the potential buyers of a house, it does not mean he wants to see all the hunters registered in the system. Besides, the realtor can not edit his own profile can change real estate company, because the edit method in the controller is not realized. And in models, some relationships shouldn't appear because one of the model is not created, such as the model house_hunters, which has many queries, but the model query is not created.�"
0,The code follows the general guidelines for quality and concept of clean coding. The models and controller were designed with general practice approach using Ruby and Rails coding methodologies.
0,functions are not named properly. example�getphoto in photos_controller.
0,Code is clean and easy to understand. Some unused/unimplemented empty function definitions are there in the files.
0,Code looks neat and clean.
0,Code is well written. All the conventions of the rails framework have been followed. The functions have been properly defined and does only what it is supposed to do.
0,The code was committed throughout the project and code was committed in the second round too.
0,Yes. Team is continuously pushing changed on the github but not distributed equally among team mates. I could see 81 commits till now.
0,"This team is keep on submitting their changes throughout the project, and not only one or two members of the team, but all of them are playing a role in this project. Besides, they did commit changes in round 2."
0,The team committed the changes in round 2 but overall the commits were not consistent.
0,Yes they committed a lot of code after first review which can be due to the fact it wasn't deployed by review 1. But overall the number of commits is higher than average i believe
0,yes about 83 commits.
0,The team improved upon certain aspects of their code. This included establishing the admin functions and actions as adding new companies and to view various participants involved.
1,"Relationships have not been properly defined in the models. For example, in the company.rb file, the relationships have been commented out. Also, in the case of house model, it had only been related to a realtor and not to a real estate company."
0,Found that company has many users missing House�has many inquiries and reply missing.
0,"Team has tried implementing relation between model, but they does not seem to work well. deleting one branch of relation does not affect other branch though they are associated.�"
0,"Not really. First of all, as I was mentioned above, the relationship between house_hunter and query didn't handle properly. Second, a realtor should belong to a real estate company, not ""has one"", and the real estate company should has many realtors, and the mapping of two models does not work. The company id of realtors in realtors' list look like a set of random number, which has nothing to do with the table real estate company."
0,I think the system handles the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships well. The relationships are clearly defined with no problems.
0,Seeing from the schema file the logic seems fine but unable to test it out.
0,there is only one relationship in the whole project. Not a good database design. Plus destroying one entity won't delete another as i can see from the code. Rest i am not able to test as i am not able to login other than admin. Not able to register as well.
0,The code procedure and application justified the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships between the realtor and house hunter model as well as real estate company and realtor relationship mapped as 1-to-n.
0,"No form validation in the create new company page. For example, when 'Founded' field is given as text and updated, it succeeds but the value is saved as a 0. Admin is�unable to add new realtors. Throws up an error. Admin is�unable to add new house hunters. Throws up an error. Not able to sign up as either a realtor or house hunter. Gives the ""something went wrong error"". Something is wrong with the deployment. Please look into it. �"
1,Search functionality for houses not found. Asking for company id and realtor id which is difficult for the user to remember. A better would be to associate house based on a company name or add the house to the company associated with the realtor. Admin not able to add realtors. Admin not able add inquiries or reply to inquiries or add himself as a potential buyer. Unable to sign up as a hunter or realtor. Only admin is able to create the users. �
0,"1)In the first release there was a issue in user registration. The issue still persists. Team has kept both realtor and house hunter registration on the same page that only allows house hunter to register. 2)Can not register new realtor using registration link. For simpler design, team could have simply give 2 links for 2 types of user registration. 3)Team tried covering many functionalities as compared to last release and succeeded partially. 4)Team has provided admin credentials and admin functionalities are working fine."
0,"They fix part of the problems showed in round 1. All kinds of user still cannot edit his own profile, even though admin can perform CRUD of hunters and realtors. And the realtor can not replace and create a new company. The hunter can not make inquires and realtor are not able to reply them. Besides, the search filter for the houses are not working. And when a realtor views the house's potential buyers, he/she will see all the hunters registered in the system."
0,I think the authors did a good job in developing the system. The system is working as it is supposed to work.
0,"I am unable to signup so could not login and check for functionalities. But, UI is improved a lot and the confusing sign up page in round 1 is fixed."
0,"Able to login with admin and use all functionalities . But unable to signup for realtor or househunter it shows the heroku page ""we're sorry something went wrong"""
0,not able to login other than admin. not able to register myself. edit option is not working when admin is trying to edit. inquires/respond to inquiry etc i am not able to test as i am not able to register myself.�search not working on heroku but they have mentioned its working in local.
0,"In the first round, the application was slightly performing better as compared to the final one. The team may have had troubles while merging and unresolved conflicts lead to error pages for signups."
0,Not able to test as the sign up failed and admin couldn't add users too.
0,HH is able to view all the other house hunters and their contact details which only admin is designated to view. Major privacy breach. README.md file well written.
1,"1)Admin is able to delete the company which has houses and realtor associated with it. When you try to edit houses associated with such company, the add button does not perform any action. where in if you try to edit houses, houses get edited successfully. It seems like relation between model and tables is not maintained properly. 2) While creating new houses realtor is asked to enter id of company and realtor. � These id's are back end data with system incremented numbers and not given to user after� � � �registration. Hence we should restrain displaying such back end information to users.� 3) Not able to submit inquiry. Posting an inquiry and reply to the inquiry is on same page, visible to house hunter. 4)� With this release team has written README file very well and neatly. Also provided admin credentials. � � �Below are few major functionalities team�can�work upon: � � �a)House hunter can create new company. � � �b)Can not register as realtor. � � �c)Search functionality not working. � � �d)Potential buyer functionality not implemented properly.

0,"Actually, all these edge cased list above are not realized at all.� And the mapping relationships between the models don't work at all. For example, when I delete a real estate company, and I look back to realtors' list, nothing happened, because the company id in the realtors' list looks like some random number, such as a company id 6, which is not appear in the company list. And so does the house list.�"
0,Functionalities work fine but could not find inquiries form after logging as an admin.
0,"Couldn't check the base cases, edge cases.� Also found high similarity of program2 doc that detailed the requirements with readme�"
0,The edge cases lead to following results : 1. It asks for confirmation before destroying the company. After that the company is deleted even for those with some realtors and houses. 2. Unable to test due to failure for realtor signup. 3. It asks for confirmation before destroying the house hunter account. Unable to test for inquiries due to failure for house hunter signup. 4. The system does not allow new realtor or house hunter to sign up for application.

0,"Some very basic testing is done for controllers, nothing in models"
0,"they have just tested signup.�controller looks good, but model testing isn't complete."
0,The team thoroughly tested the Admin model and controller. The tests for admin performed checks for admin functionality to be able to view the list of houses created by the realtors as well as look up for realtors and house hunters information that are involved in application.
0,"yes, the code is written in a clean and readable way. Only one task is handled by each method and in case of multiple tasks, function calls have been implemented perfectly. There is no bad naming in this project. Code in model and controller looks fine. Proper spacing of function and its block is done."
0,The code looks comprehensive to a good extent with the usage of clear naming. The naming is done well with attention to the singular and�plural nouns for models and controllers. No�problem with respect to the coding clarity.�
1,"Most of the code follows standards.� But I was not able to verify the complex examples like adding house to interest list, email when a reply is given by realtor as it is not working. In�replies_controller.rb avoid using class variable and use instance variable."

0,Commits after the first review by all team members is seen.
1,"Regular commits were not done. Everything was committed in one commit which should be discouraged. Think about working professionally, you should be committing code ASAP and committing with proper commits and description. Commit also should not be all module at once but individual.�"
1,"Yes, the team has committed changes in round 2 also. Overall it looks like the codes were pushed to master and one go. Regularly committing the files could have been better."

0,Some of the relationships are handled in the project.� I can't find the other important association like: 1. company has many houses(why it is commented?) 2. house belongs to a user or a company � �
0,This relation is handled well.
0,DB design is not taken care of properly. Various mappings between entities�have not been established.

The application broke in Heroku when I tried to login though it might be a Heroku specific error. The login/signup buttons on the landing page don't seem to work. In fact, none of the buttons seem to work, and I am not even getting the hand pointer as you have mentioned in the readme."
0,"As a hunter, I�get a ""View house inquiries"" button but the system crashes when I click on it."
0,"When admin try to delete a user, the website return some error. When the admin try� to delete a real estate company, it just redirect to the edit route instead of delete the company�"
0,"Here is something which needs to be focused: 1. I can't see the association between company and houses.� 2. Deletion of company by admin is redirecting to show.html.erb and not deleting the company. 3. I'm not able to view the inquiries too. In most of the views, deletion is not working."
1,"Deleting a house hunter does not work,�possible error in deployment. � Edge cases Company cannot be created without filling all details. This is implemented.

0,Readme doesnt cover the edge cases.

0,Looks good. There are some files which are misleading like Realtors folder has edit_company file which is blank. Also the readme.md file is missing the Admin Login Details.
1,"Overall, code is clean and readable.�Naming and project structure is consistent with good practices. One issue that stood throughout the code is that authorization is done directly in controller methods. It would be better if this common functionality was moved to a separate function call (e.g. validating user's role in houses_controller#create method)"
0,The code is clean.

0,"There are new commits, however the quality of commit messsages is terrible. Commit message should have a short description of what was changed not just be random words like foo1, foo2 or hasdfsdsd."
0,Yes team had been pushing changes on github continuously with neat commit messages in Round 2 also.� With 49 commits till now. Yes i can see last commit on 11 th Oct 2018. But commits are not distributed equally.
1,Although branching strategy was followed. The commits mostly seem to be made on the second-last and last day of submission. It will be helpful to keep committing code at the end of each day or every couple of days so that there is no major issue of merging at the end. Also it ensures that all team members are working on the same copy of code.
1,"Yes, changes we committed in round 2. Code commit could have better by committing�as soon�as possible. Committing few files and writing proper comments and description for the commit was missing. As a reader, I was not able to understand what a particular commit meant and what module was changed because there was no proper explanation.�"
1,"The team continued to make changes in round 2 on a regular basis. However, naming should have been more descriptive.�In�many cases it is not possible to understand the scope of the commit. One team member's work is not reflected in GitHub's contributors panel. I would suggest fixing this by matching user's credentials�of local machine and�remote server."
0,�All the mapping looks good. Nice job
0,"Yes, the DB design handles these relationships correctly."
0,"Team has Mapped house, realtor, company also house hunter, inquiries well in the model. �"
0,The Schema is very well defined. Most of the suggestions provide as part of initial review are incorporated. The relationships are defined correctly and use of dependent destroy ensures that child records are deleted before parent record. This ensures there is consistency.
0,Implemented the mappings properly.
0,This system handles all relationships�properly by using has_many/belongs_to constructs correctly and addition of relevant foreign key attributes in the appropriate tables.
0,Unable to create a new house
0,"�The system now has the basic functionality that was missing last time like logging in. Good job on the fixes. It crashed when as a realtor I attempted to create a house, telling me to check the logs for more information if I was the owner. Still no information on an admin user listed in the github readme though."
0,"There were many missing pieces of functionality. I note them below:  I was unable to create a House as an Admin.� I get an error when attempting to search for Houses.� As an Admin,I was unable to update or create a Realtor, though I could delete them. As an Admin, I shouldn't be able to set the password of a Realtor or House Hunter, that is a security vulnerability.� I was unable to create a House Hunter as an Admin.

0,"1. Team has worked well compared to last release on UI and tried�to cover up�all the functionalities. 2.� I still can not see Admin credentials in ReadMe file, ReadMe file only states there will be only one admin in the system.

1,"Admin Login Details are not present in Readme.md file. Atleast Untill now. It may be a case of wrong Readme file commited at the last moment. I have looked into the seeds.rb file and got the admin details from there. Do make changes in the Readme file. Things which needs to be corrected: 1) Admin Should not be able to edit any of his details apart from his name. 2.) Editing a company should only update it (which is working fine). The message shown to user says a new company is created which is slightly misleading. Will be a very small message change. 3) Creating and Viewing Houses Functionality not working currently. gives Application error with message check logs for more details. 4) Admin is able to create Realtor and House Hunter. But once I delete some users and then click on Realtor's Account or House Hounter's Account options given on the UI, it throws Application error same as above. Can you explain about about why this buttons are given and what should it exactly do?� �5) Admin is able to delete himself from users/househunters/realtors list. This should not be allowed. 6) Not able to check Potential Buyers and Interests functionality as Admin, as creating or view house is not functioning currently. May be you can check the logs. Might be a small deployment error like get/ post methods misplaced. 7) For Realtor and HouseHunter Signup, it should be allowed to sugnup without specifying company or other details except name, email, password as per the usecase given.

0,The team has done a great job in testing. Admin controller is tested extensively with relevant concise comments�and Rspec is used to test admin model with its validators.
0,"The code employed good naming and seemed to be DRY and follow standard Ruby on Rails practices. The methods were kept short. HouseInterestList would make more sense as HouseInterest. Each row in the table is one wish list entry, not a list of wish list entries."

0,"No bad naming, handles multiple tasks with multiple function calls."
0,"The code is in general clean and readable. Nearly all methods seen handle only one task, or use function calls to handle other tasks. Naming seems appropriate in all of the files. There are no overly nested blocks."
0,The code is well written.
0,good coding practice followed.
0,The code looks clear and understandable
1,"The�functionalities�of interest list and inquiries are implemented in a crude way, i.e. by creating a drop down for a listings. It becomes very tedious for the user to go and choose a house from hundreds of listings every time to just add it to a interest list. A better way would have been by creating an option of adding to the interest list where user can see all the listings. Adding a user to interest list does not add the buyer a to a house's potential buyer's list. There is no option for viewing potential buyers."
1,"Nicely implemented code. Used ruby delegations appropriately, and the code is very readable.� However, a few things can be improved.� for eg, in inquiriy_replies_controller, flash[] is used to transfer data from the new method to the params method, which is not the correct way. Also, I believe that the implementation can be made more efficient by reducing the number of database hits. For example, in almost all the controllers, there are redundant database hits:�User.find(session[:id]).role_type == ""buyer"" could have been identified during login. A second hit to identify the role type or any such info can be avoided. For a small test database, this would not show any performance decrease but as the records increase the pages will become exponentially slower.�� Maybe you can store these in memory [Session?], which would reduce time taken significantly at a small memory overhead."

1,"The database handles all the relationships very well. On the downside, there is a flaw in database design - keeping a single user table and single role type means the same email address can not be used for both realtor and house hunter profiles.

0,"Since the app threw an exception on the homepage and was unusable, this score reflects what was achieved in round 1. 27/35 basic functionalities passing corresponds to 77% or four stars.

0,The role switch option between realtor and househunter�is not present. Further the operation cannot be performed manually also as same mail id cannot be used for creating two accounts.
1,"Since the first round, authors seem to have progressed a lot, and added most of the missing functionalities. However, following are some of them I found missing: 1.There is no potential buyer's list for a house that can be viewed by a realtor., however there is a link to the house inquiries. 2. I am not able to associate a company to my profile as a realtor. The realtor should be able to work for only one company, however, here I am able to add multiple companies, which should be restricted to admin only. 3. preconfigured admin - unable to login to the system as admin"
0,"Several functionalities are working, however a few of them are still not.� The list is provided below: � A realtor can not see houses which do not have images attached.

0,All the basic functionalities have been implemented. Team as whole have worked really hard to make common functionality work.
1,"The necessary functionalities are implemented. The README file explains how to access some of these functionalities also. However, the company listings appear even before the realtor chooses a company. This shouldn't happen"
1,There was no functionality implemented during 1st review. So there is a drastic improvement. However there are some functionalities which need further improvements. 1)Admin has no option to post or view houses.2)Admin is not able submit inquiry or reply to inquiries.3) Admin has no option currently to edit his profile. He should be able to edit his name. 4)Multiple Realtors and House Hunters can be created with the same email ID. There is no email or role validation. This will allow a lot of duplicate entries and the app will also be suseptible to attacks by robots. Can be improved by a 2 line validation code in model.5) Password should be encrypted. While entering the details too it should not be displayed as plain text. Can be improved by simply using type as password instead of text� in views. and applying encryption in model so that password is encrypted throughout the application6) Search House Functionality does not work when a new house is created. It shows the same old results.7)Also the description specifies Search by Price Range. But it has only one field to input price. This won't work if the user wants to see a house which is between 1000 to 3000 bucks or any house which is less then 3000 bucks. Since the app shows only houses greater then the price entered.8) Realtor is able to create a house even if he is not associated with a company. 9) Realtor is able to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries for all houses without being associated to a company. There should be a check to ensure that realtor is able to post a house only if he is associated with a company. Also the option to view potential buyers and reply to inquiries should only be enabled for houses which are associated with his company. In case of no company association he should be promted to associate himself with a company or create a new company first.

1,Basic functionalities are working in the sense that able to add users but many features are missing. Unable to use same email id for realtor and househunter� Admin is not able to edit house records Realtor cant view other realtors Real Estate Company info not there for any house therefore it invalidates many requirements
1,Certain test cases are not possible to test due to the way edit realtor is implemented. The website takes real estate company id and not name for update. Being a user I wouldn't know the company id and hence won't be able to perform the right test
1,"The basic test cases mentioned in the read me work fine. It does not cover the edge cases as mentioned above, but some of the validations I tried seem to have worked."
1,Deleting company doesn't delete it's houses. No form of cascade delete present anywhere.

The User experience was also considerably improved throughout the application."
1,"Most functionalities are working great. In the first round admin was missing some basic functionalities, now they are present and working. One issue that I came across is that while admin is creating a new company, the system keeps raising an error saying that the website url is invalid and so the users cannot create new company. Maybe, there is something wrong with the validations of Company model. However, when realtor creates the company, this error does not occur."
0,the inquiry form is not working

The admin, realtor, customer functionalities are working fine and I can see a lot of improvement from the previous version. The realtor can send a receive queries by the customer.

0,All the edge cases pass. Well done!
0,"When an admin deletes a real estate company which has realtors and houses, the company gets is getting deleted along with the realtors which is not the expected functionality because realtors can exist even without being a part of a company.

Spacing is inconsistent in some classes (househunter_controller.rb#search and houses_controller.rb#show). There are some cases when decomposition�and moving functionality into a separate method would make sense.

1,The team has a well documented history of commits. The team has been regular in updating the github repository. The team has kept on updating the repository through both the periods of the submission. The team also has used proper commit messages to document the commit history. The readme file has also been updated regularly and contains detailed report on the functionalities associated with each user role. Also the testing information has been updated on the repository. The team could have added information on how the tests can be run . The team could have added information on how to setup the environment after cloning the repository and what all dependency information is associated with the application. The readme file could have been more structured with proper titles and paragraphs.
0,Yes there are commits after round 1 review but by review 1 the project wasn't working and hence these commits are probably partially to make it work in the first place.
0,"Well written code, clean and easy to read."
1,I really appreciate the organization of your code. Everything is grouped in appropriate folders and easy to navigate. I also like how most of your code is indexed and spaced. Great readability. Functions are clearly written to handle exactly what the name indicates. There are a few places where the continuation of parameters should be realigned (examples: company_params in Companies Controller and format of website in Company model). Overall great use of Ruby styling standards.
1,Short methods - Good. project structure - good. I feel you haven't committed everything to GIT. Please check that.

I can see that good work was made toward implementing missing functionality from the first round of submission."
0,I see only 1 contributor. Also only once the commit was made.
0,They committed quite many changes on the day of submission.
1,Many appropriate relationships are implemented. (a) companies(1) to houses(n) (b) house(1) to photo(1) and (c) house(1) to possible buyers(n)�. I believe there should also be an association with how there a realtor can only belong to one company. This will ensure many necessary functional dependencies are in place for the required application flow. Keep the ones you have and continue to add missing associations as you go through the requirements check.
0,User model doesn't include any relationship with other models.
1,"Not able to see the mapping�between inquiries and houses.� Also, not able to see mappings between potential buyers and houses.� Did you forget to commit? Because the deployed version is working but GitHub�doesn't�have the latest code."
0,"I didn't see any mapping done between tables, for example,�the company-realtor relationship isn't shown 1-to-n."
1,"The application has really come a long way from the previous submission. I believe most of the page routes follow an appropriate application flow. There are several of the dependencies that are evidently not implemented do to the following observations: (1)�Users are able to assign him/herself a Real Estate Company that doesn't exist in the system. This assignment should only be made with existing companies to fulfill the requirement of mapping a realtor to a single company. This missing dependency also reflects in the creation of houses. Realtors are able to create houses that are not listed with the company that the realtor is associated with. This association should be automatically made according to the company assigned to the realtor. (2) Users can be both a hunter and a realtor at the same time and can switch back and forth. How do you differentiate between a users abilities? Probably the best option would be to only allow users to be either a house hunter or a realtor. That would eliminate some of the ambiguities is associations and some unnecessary profile fields like house hunters having a real estate company. (3) Inquiries are not associated with houses. This posses an issue with knowing what property the house hunter is requesting information about. Overall, there have been great advances in your application since the first submit. Continue implementing those dependencies so that the required associations can hold. �"
1,"Deletion of House by admin is failing. Privacy breach�- As a user, I am able to see details of all other users. Only admin should�be able to see details of other users. Overall very good effort. If�the above issues weren't�there, I would have given full points."
0,New houses are not adding.
0,I couldn't log in using the admin credentials. Rest worked fine for me. Couldn't add houses in my interest list as a House Hunter.
1,"Success in edge case testing is determined by the association of the module, to self or with other modules. Many edge cases in this application are dependent on relationships between modules. For example, because houses are not properly associated with realtors or companies, reassigning a realtor's company appears to have no affect. Administrators are not able to�delete users or companies, but� I would image it would not throw an error. There are cases that I tested that dealt specifically around the models. Example: user accounts can be created with the same email accounts as long as they are of different user types.�This and other edge cases of it type proved successful. It would be great to have edge case information listed in the ReadMe to clarify how these cases were dealt with. Again, implementing the necessary dependencies between models will help to eliminate many of these edge case issues.�"
1,"Not handled (1) - No actual link created between companies and users as user just stores the company name as a string. Instead, saving the company_id for the user will create a relation between them as the company_id will act as a foreign key. That way edge case example (1) can be handled. Not handled (2) -� Realtor can edit/delete any house that (s)he created even if company changes. Handled. When a user is deleted, (s)he is automatically deleted from potential buyer list of house.   The README.md does not cover how the system handles edge cases."

0,"If as a realtor, I am trying to update my profile where I only change my company to a random company�""ABC"", it is updating just fine which I believe should not be done because the company doesn't exist and is not even being added to the company list as a new company.

1,"There are some really great controller tests included in this application. Most of the functions in each controller are tested to ensure that they are returning and routing to the appropriate pages. Unfortunately, there are no model tests implemented.

I didn't see any extremely large methods, views were clean and simple, and controllers had one-to-one mappings with application-level functions.� I do think I would encourage this team to consider using scopes in their models next time as I did not see many here."
0,"The code is clear and simple, most functions have seperate�method calls."
0,The code followed the basic practices for clean and effective programming using Ruby and Rails. The methods and function calls were efficient in that they only performed the task it was assigned to do.
0,They started adding more commits after the first round of reviews.
0,The team kept committing�their changes even in round 2.
1,A major portion of the project was completed in the first stage itself. Certain noticeable changes that the team implemented in this stage included setting up admin functionalities to view and destroy the realtor or househunter accounts.
0,The models had the correct relationships. The database seemed to have missed some of these. There was not table for potential buyers (n-to-n house-hunter relationship).
0,I think this team nailed the entity relationships with this application. Everything had the right relationships.
0,The relationships between various entities is clear.
0,The relationships of realtor to real estate company or realtor to house hunter justified proper mapping between them. The system handled the 1-to-n and n-to-n relationships properly.
1,"Overall this was a usable system. However, This app did not do a good job of keeping track of my session. Once I edited that admin account, I could not navigate via links to the home page and was also asked to sign-in again if I clicked ""admin sign-in"". Even if I signed up as a different user, my admin account was still signed into. I also was not logged-in upon signing-up as a Realtor or House-Hunter. � Some other comments are:  An Admin should be able to set the password for realtor or house-hunter. That is a security vulnerability.� When I tried to use the ""Reset password link"", I get an error. When creating a house as an Admin, I shouldn't have to know the ID of the company, I should be provided a drop-down of existing companies - the same way for how a realtor chooses a company to join. Asking a realtor to choose or create a company before signing up is another security vulnerability�- you leak the existing companies and allow someone who isn't a user of your system to create a company. The Inquiry and Interest flow in this application is really well done.�  �"
0,"As a house hunter I could edit houses. Also, anyone can create a company, and a realtor cannot create a company before signing up. A realtor could not submit a reply to an inquiry. A realtor could not drop his or her company and could list a house without choosing a company. Last, table IDs are all over the site which is confusing and not helpful to the user. These IDs should not appear to the user or have to be used to create new entities."
0,The search button in not there. No way to add new house. Realtor is given some destroy privileges which are not meant for him.�
0,The basic functionalities in the system are working properly�
0,The user interface of the system helps to understand the general flow of the program. It also supports sessions and enables user to navigate based on their tasks.
0,3) The admin encountered an exception when trying to view potential buyers of a house after its only potential buyer was deleted. � The README.md did not describe how the system handles edge cases.
0,Here a few things I found:  I could list a house that was built in the future. I was also required to give a full date instead of just a year. I was able to edit a house as a House Hunter
0,"The Readme file does not specify any information about how edge cases are handled but the edge cases were properly handled. when the real estate company was deleted all the houses and realtors under it were also deleted. However the role switch option between realtor and househunter�is not available, further this operation cannot be performed manually also as the code resticts�a mail id from being used for two accounts."
0,"Upon testing the system for edge cases, the following results were obtained : 1. The real estate company is destroyed and the realtors houses and houses inquiries for the same are removed. 2. The realtor can switch to another company. They will be prohibited to remove the houses listed in the previous company though. 3. The house hunter accounts are deleted without their inquiries . 4. The System does not check for regex fr phone number input during signup."
0,"Code in the model methods looks very clean. Attribute symbols are appropriately validated and proper constraints are applied to measure uniqueness. The controller code has great parenthesis and bracket use for function calls and assignments. More consistent spacing of functions and function content would aid in the readability of the code. Also, there are a few instances where conditional blocks are empty. If there is no purpose for the block, it should be removed (example found in the static page controller). Overall, the code seems to implement good Ruby style standards. �"
0,"The code is readable and easy to understand, but at the same time it is not effectively modularized.There are seveal�methods which perform the functions of other methods too, which could have better been modularised Apart from that,�"
0,"Most of the code is auto-generated from rails generator so they do the generic thing. Although they have connected most of the app, the basic functionalities are still lacking and no new code has been written. The only part I see is the sessions controller that has been written manually, and follows correct coding convention."
0,"1. Yes, that is taken care of. 2. No bad naming 3. Questionable redirection.�"
0,"The repository name isn't what it is supposed to be. Naming seems inappropriate. plus, there is no read me file explaining the flow of webapp."
0,Code quality looks good. Standard conventions have been used. It is also good to see that the team has used seeds.rb for data generation.� �
0,some direction code is ambiguous
1,There are no issues with code quality or naming.�Code is clean and readable and follows Ruby on Rails practices.� Most methods are short and do�one�specific task. One possible improvement would be moving out�authorization functionality from controller methods to separate functions.
0,Group continued to revise and commit changes for the project throughout round two. Commits were clearly stated as to the purpose. You can see the development process of the project through the changes applied.
0,"The commits were not scattered throughout the development cycle, rather they were concentrated on a particular couple of days, which indicate that the project was a last minute rush, rather than a pre-planned and well executed one.�"
0,"Very Few commits in the project, with most commits coming just from one user towards the deadline period. A lot of Commits done after the deadline period"
0,The team did not commit their changes throughout the project period. The changes were committed in round 2.
0,"Yes, 22 commits in total and they have consistently kept on working on Git throughout."
0,"No, majority checkins are near deadlines and not well spread out. Usage of multiple branch is good.�"
0,"The team has pushed almost all the commits on 2-3 days of the entire cycle, not regular. Also, the commits are made by one person, which seems strange to me."
1,"Most commits were done by one person which�cannot be considered a good practice. Naming�of commits is done well, names are descriptive of�the introduced changes. I would suggest�doing commits more often by dividing work into smaller chunks."
0,"It seems that some of the associations were attempted. (1) Real Estate Company contains many users and houses and (2) House belongs to a Real Estate Company and a user. These relationships are currently commented out so the dependencies are not enforced. There are additional connections missing such as the Users model, where a Realtor should belong to only a single company and many houses. The implementation seems incomplete, but the idea found within the company and house models is moving in the right direction."
0,The relationship mapping was appropriate and worked as intended. The database unfortunately didn't implement all the necessary features required for the submission. (For example: list of potential buyers)
0,"All the 1-n, n-n Relationships have been commented out. There are no mapping table in Schema as well."
0,"To the most extent of it. Since, the profile of admin is problematic and not allowing us to login at all. That area is unavailable for testing.�"
0,"As of now, all relationships have been commented out, I am not sure why this has been done. �"
1,Following are some of the relationships missing: � house hunter has_many inquiries realtor has_one company
0,"1-to-n and n-to-n relationships are handled correctly. The system utilizes foreign key columns in the database to achieve this. For example, 1-to-n relationship between realtor and real estate company is achieved by adding a�company_id field to user table. Same utilized by houses table which are linked to one realtor and one company."
0,can not log in as admin
1,"Your home page is very clear as to�the application purpose. Unfortunately, I am unable to sign up as a new user or login�with any of the pre-configured user accounts included in the Readme. I can, however, attempt to sign up and/or login but this information is never saved to the database for future access or the appropriate transitioning is not implemented. I like that there are two options listed on the homepage to either sign up as a new user or to login in as a current user. This is convenient for navigation. Consider spacing these links for easier identification. I would also point out that the options in the drop down box included for selecting user type during sign up is a great idea. The third option, is a ambiguous as to its purpose. What does it mean to sign up as a realtor who is also shopping for a house? Perhaps you can just limit the options to Realtor or House Hunter. The functionality of searching homes should be included in the Realtor services. Keep up the work. Once the database is successfully receiving user details and/or the appropriate routes are assigned, additional functionalities should be easy to implement."
0,"There are a lot of functional bugs. Also, lots of required functionalities like listing a house as interested, list of potential buyers etc are missing. Also, there are a lot of navigational bugs. For example, when a user is both, a realtor and a househunter, he gets an option to create a new company when viewing list of enquiries, which should not have been the cae."

0,1. Cannot test as delete functionality is missing. 2. Cannot test as functionality is missing. 3. Cannot test as delete functionality is missing.
0,Most of the edge cases cannot be tested�due to problems with accessing admin's account. Functionality pertaining to inquiries add/edit/delete is not implemented.
1,"There is only a single test file included with this application, sessions_controller_test. The functionality tested within this file attempts to cover starting a new user session. The test ensures that a new session is returned through an assertion statement equating to true. There are many additional functions of the sessions controller that should be tested including create, destroy, successful log in, etc. Making sure that each of these methods are functional will aid in the development of further successful application flows. I would recommend testing the basic models and their accompanying controllers before you begin implementing things such as house inquires and user responses."
0,"The application seems to have been developed, but not tested enough, as apart from just naviagtional bugs, there are also functional bugs. Many of the required things are also not implemented, hence there was not much stuff to rate for."

0,Clean code and readable. 1. Yes 2. No 3. None
1,"The code is clean and readable, but there's only one suggestion. The page which lists houses (index) and search houses are handled by different controllers, whereas, they could have been easily integrated into one, without compromising code readability. It would have lead to a more integrated and a cohesive web app. In one or two instances, there were several functions performed within a function, which could have been better modularised too."
0,Very well written in the style of writing and the ruby MVC architecture is properly implemented.� 1. They have suitably defined methods to handle particular tasks following the appropriate MVC architecture and also following the correct session management.� 2. Nothing is inappropriately named. They have very smartly worked on it.� 3. Coding style is absolutely conversant with the Ruby on Rails flavor of coding.�

A minor bug, but still breaks the consistency."
0,Perfectly functional and very well styled with the use of CSS and also the GUI is very user friendly.�
1,The system works exactly how it is supposed to work. I could not find any functionalities that are still failing. No bugs or error messages. It would have been better if the realtor could send replies to inquiries directly from the application than opening a separate mail application.

0,"When a real estate company is deleted, the respective houses are deleted, the realtors are not. Further, even after deletion, the company of those realtors remains the same. They can even edit the deleted company from their profile and list a house on behalf of the deleted company. When a realtor edits and updates his company after it is deleted, it actually gets created again. When a realtor changes his company, he can view only the houses of his current company and is prohibited to delete houses of his previous company. This works as expected. When a house hunter is deleted, (s)he gets removed from the potential buyers list, but inquiries are only partially deleted as in the row is still there but only two columns show data. � � �"
0,"(1): when an admin deletes a company which has existing realtors, it shows on the admin page that the company is deleted, but when the realtor signs in, it still shows that he belongs to the deleted company, and is able to update all the profile information of the company. So, it means the company is not being deleted, even when it says so on the admin page. (2): the realtor isn't able to view any houses except his own company. (3): No, the inquiries are not auto deleted, nor is the househunter removed from potential buyers list."
0,1. This test case is a flaw as an admin can hitherto delete whenever and whatever he wants.� 2. This too is not strongly tested and runs into glitches on doing so.� 3.

0,"Edge cases are not explicitly handled, but the validations and logic will limit edge case scenarios from affecting the application."
0,"1) If the admin deletes a company, all the related properties will be deleted and will remove the company name assigned to any realtor. 2) If the realtor changed his or her company, the realtor cannot make changes to old posts which they have posted for the previous company they worked for. So they will not be able to edit,add or remove the houses listed in previous company. 3) If the house hunter is deleted by the admin, all the inquiries by the house hunter will be deleted and their names in the potential buyers list is removed.

1,"Yes, the login / signup module seems to be very well tested, considering the fact that all the three types of users (admins, househunters and realtors) are managed by using the same table. But, there's also a small functional bug. Even if I hadn't regisitered as a househunter or a realtor, I am able to switch back and forth between the roles, which is kind of counter-intuitive in many ways."

I saw a lot of complicated views, which to indicates lack of separation of concerns.� I would recommend�being more diligent�about the scope of variables and continue trying to push concerns/responsibilities to isolated classes and methods."
1,"The logic in the code looks proper, still the code itself is hard to follow. Primarily because, a lot of functionality has been added in a method whose name suggests only partial functionality, and no comments have added anywhere. Examples are-: In applicatins_controller.rb, the methods get_realtor_nav_bar and get_hoousehunter_nav_bar make SQL queries and other functionalities. In houses_controller.rb the show method also has a lot code that ideally should not belong in that method. I would suggest to put such code in different methods, or name the method better. Do not shy away from creating 10 different methods if need be, it organises code much better and simpler to understand."

1,"I think this team did not correctly implement several database relationships.�For instance, a House does not have many users, it has a single realtor (the realtor who posted it) and it might have many interested users (potential buyers), but that should have been via a through relationship.

0,There aren't much big changes. The changes have been crisp and self explanatory.
1,More comments are needed because I had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. The code follows Ruby Style Guide and is DRY in its design. Functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. Kudos!
0,"1. Functions are of appropriate length and well structured with respect to the purpose in question.� 2. All code has been suitably well put into the methods with their intended function and work cutout for them.� 3. No, the comments have been well placed and self explanatory making it easy to follow.� 4. The code does follow the ruby style guidelines and is thorough in that regard.� 5. Nope, all code is consistent and to the point.�"
1,I feel you guys should add a few comments for a third person to follow.
0,The added code is crisp and of required size. There isn't much addition anyway to worry about it violating DRY principles.
0,The team has only made one significant change to the following file: app/controllers/assignments_controller.rb . It is an if statement which is difficult to follow since the team has not written any comments for the same.
0,Extremely small change. No problems found.
1,"Issue #1201 In the assignments_controller code, the team has checked in a puts statement (line 48) which looks like debug code. Even though these are helpful during the development phase, we need to remove them before finally pushing them. Issue #391 The comment (assignments_controller.rb:85) is not descriptive enough. The author has commented out a method call. It would be beneficial to the person reading the code to understand the intention behind this. Please provide a detailed comment on why this was done. Again the author has use a puts statement (_submitted_files.html.erb:29) which should not be committed and should only be used during development/debugging. Please remove the debug code."
0,"Since the test plan is not included, i am unable to do the manual testing."
1,Manual testing seems an impossible task since it is not having a wiki doc itself which makes it impossible to have a specific design flow for the project in question to go ahead and check the program.�
1,"The features work as intended however I am having trouble navigating and checking what are the differences between the original system and the improved system. Could have made a demo video showing the improvements or a step guide to follow. They could have also provided some steps or a visual navigation guide to see the changes. For edge cases you could check what happens when assignments have same names, blank or whitespace containing names etc."
0,The team has not provided any link for me to manually test the project
0,They didn't provide a link for me to test their work.
0,No video or deployment�link provided to test manually.
0,The link for the writeup is missing.
0,The writeup seems to be missing.
0,No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given. No write up link has been provided. It was tough to navigate the code myself. No demo or link provided as well.
0,"No, the team has not been diligent in specially making a section of ""what it does"" as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have seemed to not even make a Wiki page for the same or have seemed to forget to upload it. Because, how am I supposed to follow the approach and solution of the problem if there doesn't exist any documentation to check for the same.� �"
0,There is no write-up provided as of now. The wiki page is also not done yet.
0,Didn't find any�documentation link. But it was understandable from the code links on github. �Goal is to create unique directories for each assignment.
0,No writeup link provided.
0,"They don't have a wiki page link, so I cann't see their OSS writeup."
0,The link to the writeup is missing.
1,Testing is absent in the project. This could have been because (by the looks of it) the issues were too small (only 20-30 lines code). Refer RSpec documentation to write tests. It is easy to follow.
1,"Unfortunately, no mention of the word ""test plan"" has even taken place in their whole doc. So, it seems that they are yet to implement the testing functionalities in their project. Although, it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository. � � Moreover, as a part of their project, one of their problem statements is in fact to write the tests for a specific problem scenario. I�have�reason to believe even that has not been done�judging�from the pull�request."
0,"Issues #391, #1201 were fixed but i dont see any tests as mentioned in issue #1190."
0,There are no tests. Probably you guys will do it in the next phase.
0,The�writeup�seems to be missing.
1,No mention is made as to why the changes were made in which specific files.� The code is well written but hard to follow (what is the functionality of the code is tough to decipher). It would have been better had there been some comments or documentation as to what those respective methods do.
0,"No, since no write up or no wiki page exists. it is clearly not possible to ascertain any of the above clauses. � �"
1,"Write up isn't provided. I went through their git commit and the requirement for� issue #1201. There is a 'puts' statement in the controller. I feel that should be removed, you guys might have added it for debugging purposes, but it should be removed before committing. Also, not sure how the changes made are applicable to the problem at hand which is to check if assignments have the same name if I'm not wrong."
0,No writeup/documentation found.
0,I cannot find test plan.
0,"No, they did write the test plan."
0,"All tests pass, all descriptions in the Test Plan are just the test cases in the Rspec file, sooooooo yeah I guess they all exist."
0,Authors have followed Ruby style guide. Test cases have not been discussed in the write-up.
0,"No Test Plan was included. The bare minimum of description was given for each test, and the project preamble. As far as I can tell, though, there is no document that says we should have created a Test Plan, and I bet it is safe to say that their mentor did not suggest creating a Test Plan either."
0,the writeup is lacking in terms of explanation of how to test the funcionality thoroughly.
0,"Their�variables, methods, and class names are good�"
0,Rspec tests look just fine and descriptions are intuitive.
0,Variable names and test cases are named appropriately. Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking.
0,It looks like if they fix some style issues then it could increase the code coverage. I don't understand why their last unit test does not pass though. �
0,Some of the functions are too long such as #delete function.
0,The tests look fine. It's easy to follow what the tests do.
0,"Some ""let"" methods, like�participant2, student2, response_map2,�are repetitive."
0,"All of the code appears to be above board, and no functions are overly long. The test did take like 28 seconds to run, which seems like a lot."
0,the work takes care of all the edge cases accurately.
0,"Yes their code works, and some edge cases are also correct."
0,"The video shows all the test cases pass, but I'm skeptical that they got all the�corner cases. Looking at the review_response_map.rb model, there are a lot of methods which aren't explicitly tested."
1,"Code is running and no errors are encountered. However, very few tests have been written and coverage is low. A way to make the testing more robust is to test every function with a known success case and� an edge case or potential failure."
0,"Source code is good in all spots, except the last unit test. I was unable to figure out why it did not work."
1,"some branches are skipped by the ""allow"" statement. If a method would raise an exception, then test whether it would raise it.�"
0,The writeup clearly explains the problem statement
0,the wiki page has showed up what the expertiza is and some examples have show up what the task of the team is.
0,"They don not have any test plan, and some functionality of code is not adequate for the test."
0,There's basically no documentation outside the source code itself.
0,"I could understand what the project does. However, there are fewer examples of the test."
0,"This is semi-passable. The wiki is hosted on Wikipedia, so they clearly didn't read the directions. I mean, I get it, though. I wrote tests, and was also unclear about what exactly the Wiki should contain."
0,I can not find the test plan.
0,They don not have a test plan.
0,It's unclear how complete the test plan is because their wiki does not contain their total branch or mutation coverage.
0,"No, this writeup doesn't have a test plan section."
1,"As this rubric calls for a section called Test Plan, I suggest adding it and rearranging the wiki content, so that a description of the tests is given in this section"
0,"This is not a fair ask. As far as I can tell, there is no document that says we should create a test plan."
0,The approach taken by the team to increase the code coverage has not been clearly stated. Also there is no mention about what was the existing code coverage and how much did the team increase it to?
0,Test Plan is missing
0,The test plan is not added as the part of writeup
0,"the team does not show up any design patterms. in the wiki page, the authors did not explain how and why they did, and what I can see is just the final code for some perticular exmples."
0,"Yes they have explained the way and why they did, and in their writeup, they does not mention any principles or patterns."
0,There's not really a rationale for why these particular tests are sufficient.
1,"The authors have included the different tests that they wrote, however a description of what the test is testing would be helpful."
0,"�They wrote the literal least possible, but again, I get it. Learning how to test with doubles, mocks, stubs, and spies, to peek in on the innards of a high complexity OO system was actually really difficult."
0,No details about what was changed only details related to already existing implementation has been stated.
0,"several methods are missing in the document and the rspec file like�review_response_report, import."
0,nly one test case implemented and executed which verifies whether the correct email has been sent to the reviewer.
0,All test cases are currently passing
0,�Test plan is not described fully. However whatever is mentioned in the wiki doc has been implemented via Rspec. But there are some previously running tests which are failing because of the changes.
0,An old test case fails.�Looks like it was broken before and therefore not a result of�your changes
0,All the cases discussed in test plan have been converted into automated tests.
0,"Most of the cases are covered in ""should send an email to the participant""�test case. Reviewer part and its mail content checks are not covered."
0,"Yes, unit tests Rspec are provided."
1,"I did not find the test plan in the documentation. However, there were details mentioned about the tests that the team wrote. One Test related to the issue has been written in the assignment_participant_spec file. The test works works properly. I feel that the Test plan should have been explicitly mentioned in the documentation.�"
0,Action mirror successfully implemented . Active record is also getting updated properly.
1,There are some repetitions in the code which can be avoided by creating a helper function and calling that function from each place. But apart from that code is well thought out and implemented nicely.
0,There were some issues initially when i looked at the code. But the professor has already made those suggestions about naming conventions and following the design pattern and to write appropriate methods in the right models or controllers. Looks good now.
0,� � No naming issues found
0,"The method names, variable names and class names are intuitive and suggestive of the functionality."
0,Code looks perfect. Follows standards.
0,The naming conventions have been followed. The professor had frequently asked the team to improve the naming conventions and it seems that the conventions have been properly folowed.
1,All ruby looping constructs followed to a good extent . Refactoring the code could be possible
0,Follows most he good coding practices. Follows DRY Follows ruby style guide and has no error in code climate as well
1,"Looks good. Comments could be improved. For example, In submitted_content controller there is a comment which says sending email to users. However it is just a method call which redirects it to delayed_mailer.rb. So this should be properly mentioned as it will be helpful for someone refactoring or understanding the code later."
1,"The code changes in ""app/controllers/submitted_content_controller.rb"" line 60-78, could have been in a separate method, such as send ""email to reviewers"". That would make the controller code clean and clear. � � Code changes does not follow�the DRY principle in atleast two places. 1.� In�app/mailers/delayed_mailer.rb, there is no need to duplicate the code. The code in the new method,�review_reminder_email �has been copied from�email_reminder.�The�email_reminder�method can be used instead of creating a separate method altogether. � 2.�app/models/assignment_participant.rb�and�app/models/course_participant.rb�uses a�same code to send the emails via�MailerHelper.send_mail_to_user�, that can be put in one place, so that it can be reused in both the places. � � �"
1,The code follows DRY principle. None of the functions is very long. More comments could be added but not required.
0,Code is not DRY.�
1,"I feel that the code from line 64 to 76 could have been written in a separate function to avoid making the function�submit_hyperlink from becoming so large.� Additionally, the functionality inside the function�review_reminder_email could have been separated into 2 different functions."
0,Clear statement and well layout of the wiki page.
0,All the features are implemented according to the wiki documentation submitted.
0,Edges cases are covered well in the tests
1,�The features work. However the notice messages could be improved to state exactly the action that is conducted. Eg. One of the notice message says either user is already added or it doesn't exist. Narrowing it down will be of great value.
0,The features work as intended.
0,Fix is working good. Link is up.
0,The test has already covered edge cases.
0,Clearly mentions implementation details an the problem descriptions
0,Documentation is concise and clear
1,The Wiki document clearly explains what work is done. One section for each issue. The deadline reminder functionality explains what code is changed but overall what the use-case is and what task needs to be performed could have been explained better.
0,"Very well written wiki, well explained with all the nitty gritty implementation details."
0,The writeup is written very clearly; gives good idea about the project.
0,Very detailed. All the implementation details are clearly explained.
1,The writeup is thorough but screenshots could be added. The instructions are missing too. Rest all looks good.
0,The writeup is written really well. The description about the functionality has been mentioned clearly. Good Job!
0,The writeup is clear.
0,Very clearly. The authors provide sufficient information about improve the email function(such as when become a participant).
0,Only one test is implemented and validated for .
0,Test plan is well thought out and thorough.
1,The authors have mentioned the test they have performed but no specific plan is presented. However they have adequate details about what is done and what is tested and how will the corresponding changes look like. edge case descriptions could have been included
0,"The test case, does not handle the case when the imported csv is corrupted."
0,"The ""Test Plan"" section�is missing in the writeup. But, they have included a�separate section for explaining Rspec based automated test cases."
0,Yes conditions are tested well.
1,"The details regarding testing are mentioned in the writeup. But I did not find anything about the Test plan as such, in the writeup. The assignment_participant_spec contains�a test. One edge case has been considered. I feel that the Test Plan should have been mentioned in the writeup explicitly."
1,Maybe add the code to wiki.
0,"They do have clear testing section, but not said as test plan."
0,"The report mentions all the required details like the problem statement , the old version of the code and the improved version of the code and how well it is improved and implemented , thus the report is also very well articulated"
0,"Yes each topic description starts with what the current issue is, what are the changes made and how is it impacted and what is the end result. Nicely Articulated"
1,"Code changes does not follow�the DRY principle in atleast two places. Also, the comments in the code are not helpful. All code comments are like ""# E1834 Fall 18""�which does not explain what is the code does, it only says when the code was added. Such comments may be removed."
0,The implementation strategy is clearly discussed in the writeup which is easy to follow.
0,"Yes, the bug to fix flow is very well explained. Comprehensive and easy to understand."
1,"Yes, the writeup explains the problem statement the solution implemented. But snippets of code not added and screenshots missing too. Too many github links. Could just add some snippets to make it more readable."
0,The writeup explains the implementation approach for every functionality that they implemented.�
0,"Yes, all the have done are shown in the github link."
0,Test Plan hasn't been defined because the testing is carried out by Mozilla
0,Could not find any
0,The pull request does not show any Tests done on the project
0,I don't see any test plans.
0,"The newly added code has not yet been accepted in the pull request but it does build. The corresponding rust implementation, however, has not been added and so the test coverage hasn't improved by much."
0,Seems all variables and methods follow certain naming rules.
1,"The newly added code includes the attribute height, the getContext() and transferToImageBitmap() method in the OffscreenCanvas.webidl file. The name height given for the attribute height for the Canvas makes complete sense. Similarly the name getContext() given for the method that returns the OffscreenRenderingContext is also intuitive. The name transferToImageBitmap is a little long which might be the code less readable if the method is called often. Instead the accessor convention of using getImageBitmap() feels more intuitive and also logical at the same time."
0,The build did not pass due to some minor inconsistencies.
0,"The variable , method and class names all seem to be reasonable and well written."
0,There are almost no comments.
0,"All codes construct perfectly, though not much code I could see in the git."
0,The team has not implemented any function in the pull request. They have basically defined the ImageBitmap interface that will be implemented in the future by Servo.�There can be a few comments to describe their code and about the previous implementation.�
0,The code seems DRY and follows good design principles avoiding redundancy.
0,"The code is really well written and follows Ruby Style Guide, except some areas."
0,"The implementation does not seem to be working, so it would be difficult to test this. Also, I am no Rust programmer, so there's that."
0,The features cannot be tested until the final changes are completed
0,Can not run servo as I dont have the needed environment.
0,I have no idea how to test the code manually.
0,"The code is running. However, few functionalities are not there."
1,"The�background sections were fairly clear, but the details could have been fleshed out more. Some description of the code would be better than a dump of the code."
1,"Yes, the Wiki is clear and explains most aspects of the project but there could be a better explanation for the IDL files that were added and the corresponding changes that were made because of adding these files"
0,The Wiki lists a lot of terminology but few with how they do this project.
0,A little too brief.
1,"The write-up gave a good introduction to the project by providing the background information about the Servo parallel web-engine project by Mozilla for web page rendering and Rust programming language to execute HTML5 and CSS3 parsers. It then highlighted the OffscreenCanvas API that can be used to generate frames and also return the rendered image using the transferToImageBitmap() method. The writeup covered how web workers can be used to implement OffscreenCanvas API to render images as an independent process isolated from the webpage. The problem statement of of creating�OffscreenCanvas and OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2d interfaces with�OffscreenCanvas Constructor, properties�(width and height) and getContext() method was defined. The use of Web IDL to describe interfaces for web browsers was briefed and that was followed by the code flow and the code snippet of the two Web IDL files namely- OffScreenCanvas.webidl and OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D.webidl While the write-up was cogent and clearly explained the work done, it could have elaborated on the implementation of the methods like transferToImageBitmap() and how the interface is integrated into the system to render images in a webpage using an isolated web worker."
0,The writeup was well written and explained what the Mozilla project was about. It also mentioned the purpose of the project along with the technology used to implement the same.
0,The document is really well written specifying clearly the functionalities worked on.
0,There is no test plan section or any information on how or if the feature was tested.
0,No test plan.
0,Test plan missing.
0,No Test plan was provided
0,"The write-up does not include a test plan section. If a test section had been included then the different scenarios, pre-conditions, edge cases and invalid input values would have been dealt."
0,The project didn't involve any kind of testing.
0,The writeup does not include any test plan.
0,"The writeup clearly explained the need for the off screen canvas API; however, the explanation of how the feature was implemented was too shallow. What is in those .rs files?"
1,The writeup includes the code used but it would help if the Wiki also explained how the authors came up with that solution
0,Not any clue.
0,"It is not explained why the work was done, the way it is done. But the implementation looks promising"
1,"The write-up did cover about the efficiency of Servo to render webpages quickly and smoothly when compared to Mozilla's other rendering engines. Servo does this using�parallel layout, styling, web-renders and constellation and in turn sandboxes the processes,�threads and tasks that allows the browser to fail better, hence making it more robust and secure.�It justified the use of Rust to rewrite C++ and effectively the browser as well.�"
0,The writeup details the work done by the authors and mentions how they approached implementing the OffScreenCanvas API.
0,"The writeup explains what is intended to be done. However, still the information is somewhat incomplete."
0,All the cases discussed in the test plan have been implemented.�Well done in achieving 100% test coverage and passing all the tests.
0,over 9000! I mean 90%! Great job testing Participant y'all!
0,YES.
0,Yes and it all passes too.
1,They haven't added any test plan but the test method in documentation shows that all test cases�has been checked properly and coverage is also 100%.
0,Every test case that is provided on the wiki page is part of the automated test suite. There are no cases of failing tests.
0,yes they have automated test and all of them pass
0,"Names for variables, classes, and method are properly named and make sense."
0,"The pull-bots CodeClimate and TravisCI suggest there are a few issues with style and integration that need to be addressed, respectively."
0,They kept working on it and did really impressive.
0,Didn't find any pull request. Code coverage�has increased as more tests are written and it is one of the required outcomes. Wiki states that 100% coverage is achieved and the same is demonstrated in the video link provided.
0,It looks great. Everything is followed.
0,Can't find the Pull Request
1,"Most of the source code is following standard Ruby practices. However, some cases could be improved. There is a number of variable names that are concatenated with numbers for example user1, user2 etc. While this approach can be justified in some cases, I would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. Moreover, indentation needs to be fixed to improve code readability."
0,Yes there is no unreasonable function names and all method name are suggestive and apt
0,This was a testing project and the mocked objects were appropriate.�The code is DRY. There is no redundancy in the code.
0,"So fresh and so clean, clean! This code is too neat to even be dry. Too hot to touch. I'm just still super impressed by the wiki and the video."
0,All the code is in a single file as it tests a single model and it seems to cover it extensively. It also looks like there's no DRY issues.
0,Code seems to be concise and well written.
1,The code is mostly clear and easy to follow. Test blocks are succinct and contain�one�assertion per block. One exception is the #score method. It could be improved by decomposition. The code for set up could be extracted into a separate before(:each) block and multiple 'it' statements could be used�for testing expectations.
1,"1) No all functions are reasonably long if not too short. 2) No all methods seem about right 3) no but the team could have provided some comments in the score test function, as multiple expects are included 4) The code follows ruby guidelines and they used factories efficiently 5) Yes the code is DRY, they have used after each method to achieve it"
0,"The features work as intended, they cover the test cases and edge cases as well."
0,"After working through several edge case side effects, by hand, up hill, both ways, it looks like all of their bases are covered and edge cases satisfied."
0,The features work as intended
0,"Since coverage is 100% and the code looks good to me, I am assuming it works fine."
0,"Tried to run the RSPEC test by copying the _spec.rb file and enusred that the Factory method is inserted, I got an error in 2 examples � Participant#email sends an email to the participant���� Failure/Error: assignment = Assignment.find_by(id: self.assignment_id) Participant#score Get participant score within a round���� Failure/Error: scores[questionnaire_symbol][:scores] = Answer.compute_scores(scores[questionnaire_symbol][:assessments], questions[questionnaire_symbol])����"
0,Running the code manually�resulted in the�100% coverage of the�object under test.
1,yes all the test written passes. They could have written a test to check if self[:handle] is returned if no nil parameter is sent
0,This wiki is very detailed and explains what is done for every tested method. It also contains links to all resources one may require to understand the functionalities of the project. Great Job guys !!!
0,"�This is easily the most clear of any testing write-up that I have seen to-date. It is organized into meaningful sections that follow their test plan, and show of their deliverables. �"
0,"The wiki page�provides clear details about the work, and very easy to understand."
0,The writeup is clear and easy to understand.
0,"Yes, it is easy understand that it is a testing project and how it is done."
1,"Under 'tested methods' they have explained everything really nicely. The video is just to long, 22 minutes. You have have made it short."
1,Team could have given more description on what is the Participant.rb is doing
1,The wiki clearly defines the primary objective of the project and justifies the reasoning behind introduction of additional helper constructs like participant factory. The authors complement the descriptions of each test case with associated block of code and elaborate on the details of�their inner workings. I would suggest removing parts like high level descriptions of Expertiza and Unit Tests (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/OSS_E1852.rb#Unit_Test_Description) because they are redundant in this context.
0,"Yes, the team has efficiently detailed all the details about the projects and the need for their changes to providing code of their changes. They have also attached coverage and test run screen shots for references."
1,"The test plan section is really well written. However, pre-conditions, edge cases are not very well discussed and talked about. I would suggest the team to add these into the wiki as well."
1,"Magic. How did they know they needed a Test Plan?!? They did a great job laying out how they created an environment to unit test Participant with their design choice, and chosen variables and factories."
0,looks like edge cases and invalid inputs are handled.
0,The test plan look complete enough.
0,The plan looks�good and it covers a lot of cases.
0,"the write up doesn't has a test�plan but looking at the code it seems they have check every edge case. Also since there coverage is coming to to be 100% , everything should work."
0,The test plan is comprehensive and fully covers all the methods and cases that are part of the object under test. Running the test suite yields 100% overall coverage.
0,"Yes they have come up with all possible inputs, edge cases and wrong data entries to check the system behaviour is not faulty"
0,"For every tested method, they explain�what they did and why they did it."
0,�They even wrote down their plan to accomplish the project! I love it.
0,"It is a testing task, I assume there is not any design needed."
0,It explains clearly what tests are missing and how the coverage is increased.
0,Yes�they have explained everything.
1,"The authors mostly focus on how they did what they did, i.e. inner workings of each test suite. Little to no discussion�is�provided on the overall decisions�pertaining to design principles�and patterns that have been utilized in this project. For example, there are no instances of before(:each)�blocks in the source code. This decision could be discussed and clarified in the wiki page."
0,They team has thought through efficiently to use design options that avoid test reruns and to dry out some mocks settings
0,The team has not added any test cases.
0,No new tests have been written
0,No test cases / Test plans
1,"Unfortunately, the test cases are lacking This could be improved before the second submission"
0,There is no Test plan.
0,Test cases are not being taken cared.
0,All the variables and function names used are appropriate.�
0,"The variables, names are well assigned."
1,"There a large set of variables that do not follow typical ruby naming convention. An example is that ""existAssignment"" should be�""exit_assignment"". Additionally, some names are not very helpful. For instance, the variable ""frm"" is used for a form, but why not just use ""form""?�There is also a lot of javascript written directly on the page and are difficult to read and understand as there is missing method names or other non-intuitive variable�names"
1,"The code is clear and concise. The variable, method and class name choice is correct.� One variable i feel can be changed is� top_max_choosers can be renamed to topic_max_slots, as slots has been used in the function name as well and it will be more consisted �"
1,"For the Ruby changes they have made, they have used intuitive names and used naming conventions as much as possible. def update_feedback � Some places, the variable names are used in CamelCase whereas few places they werent used. Few variable names were directly used from legacy code, although refactoring could have been done. curquestionnaire quesparams . questArray"
1,"Most of the variable names and function names are named based on proper convention. Suggestion: function addCreateTopicSection()This function name could be changed to maybe CreateTopic() or AddTopic()Apart form this, all other names look good"
1,"All the variables are defined with respect to the functionality like - max_team_size, get_participants_without_team."
0,Functions and variables are named aptly
1,Ruby coding standard has been followed. Only one function has been added in controller as per requirement. Code follows DRY principle. The�team can add comments for the code added which would be useful to understand the code.
1,"def create function in assignments controller seems to be long and could have been refactored. Considering that they used most of the legacy code and most of their work was on UI, their part on ruby changes werent much�"
1,"The team has written a concise and efficient code with proper implementation. However, some additional comments in some parts would improve the readability and make it easier to comprehend"
1,The code is well structured. Could have added more comments for easy understanding of the code. The functions are not long.
1,"Functions are of appropriate length and code is in proper methods. However, no comments are provided what so ever. �"
1,"The group has not shared the link for the test environment. Hence unable to test the edge cases. However, in the screen cast they have covered the functionalities mentioned in the requirement document."
0,I have not been supplied with a link to manually use an instance with their changes and I have not been able to find a link in their PR or write-up.
0,I could not run it locally and hence I am not sure about the edge cases. Code looks clean and should not break in most of the cases
0,"The youtube screenshare clearly shows the changes made and works perfectly. Since the edge cases arent defined, not sure about the functionalities of edge cases in this case as it involves UI most of the time"
1,"There is no link provided to test the code manually. However from the video provided, I can infer that all the features have been implemented and are working properly. Issue #718 and #926 are working as expected. In issue #971, I could see that the previous version of the 'add new topic' page had a topic description and topic category field which is not seen in the updated version. Suggestion: The team could implement that or if already implemented, add that to the wiki page to reflect the way in which that is handled"
0,The features work as intended. Edge cases are properly executed.��
0,The code works.
0,"No deployment is provided, so�couldn't�test manually.�"
0,The write up addresses details of all the three problem statements along with the code changes done in every file and the files added. The team has also added screenshots of the manual testing and the video demonstrating the functionality they added.
0,"The write up covers all the issues and is well organized, including the code blocks and the screenshots."
1,"I was able to understand the changes they were making and why, however I thought the write-up was a little too verbose and had too much code - I can find the code in their PR."
0,The Documentation is well written and indicated clearly what was the problem tackled and how it was approached and solved
1,"The writeup s format on how they distinguished the features and explained solutions for each and everything is good. First they give a bird's eye view of the problems and then deep diving into each problem with solution and screenshot is good. The background explanation given could have been more specific towards their problem statement, rather than just about expertiza. The images tend to occupy the entire page and its little difficult while going through it, a little foramatting could have made their page really good."
0,"Yes, the team has clearly stated the problem statement and the changes they have done to provide solutions to the problem. They have been given 3 problems to which they have clearly provided the names of the files and the part of the code which is changed. The video explains the problem and the implemented solution perfectly without any ambiguity."
0,The write up clearly explains about the modifications made in Expertiza.� It indicates the functionality of their work which is topic management and the problem statement is clearly elaborated. It provides the files changed and also the code snippets in which the changes are made. The write up also provides visual�representations of the changes made.�
0,"writeup�is very well written, contains enough�screenshots and explanations�of the code."
1,The write-up is well explained but could have described more on the methods whey implemented and why did it implement�in a certain way.
1,The team has not included any test cases. It would be easy�to include the test cases on the��app/controllers/suggestion_controller�for the�update_feedback�method that has been added. Also�the team may add some features test cases as most of the changes made are in html files. The�team can refer�the existing features present in the�.spec/features folder.
0,"There is no explicit test plan section, but all the scenarios are covered with appropriate images."
0,Text Plan is Missing
0,There was no Test Plan
1,"The writeup does not include the test plan as of now, but that is the only thing which is left for the team to complete. The team could work on this and try to improve the test coverage."
0,There is no test plan.
0,No test cases or test plan mentioned in the write-up.
0,The team has explained the issue and the solution they chose with enough details to understand to way of implementation.
1,"They explained it well, but there were no�larger design patterns they seemed to be following. I did think that they used AJAX in the appropriate way, but it could be improved in the future."
1,"Their solutions are well explained. The way they have explained, attaching a screenshot of a code snippet and telling, this is where we made this change, and this is how it works, gives a better understanding of their project. It could have been better if they could have compare and contrasted the previous codes, where the features where not there. That way, the background of the why this feature could have been clear."
1,"Yes, the team has explained their code and the reason for the additions made. However, for the issue #926, some more information about the Tablesorter and some additional comments would improve the writeup. Solutions to issue #718 and #971 are explained clearly and are easy to follow."
0,Design patterns were not used. Rest of the code is explained and easy to follow.
1,Code snippets are given but�need explanation.�
0,"Writeup explains what was to be done and how they did it, but does not give rationale behind the way they coded, and any alternative approaches."
0,The test plan is not about what they test in the Rspec test.
0,Yes all� the 17 test cases are automated. They have reached the goal of 90% coverage .�
0,Test cases are present.�
0,Yes all 17 test cases are automated
0,They have not yet reached the desired goal of 90% coverage.
0,Everything in the wiki was a test.
0,"It seems you have cover 94% of the participant.rb. However, all checks have failed in the pull request test."
0,"Yes, the admin has included the Test Plan cases in the automated tests."
0,The authors have implemented every test case that is discussed in the test plan. Detailed explanations and code itself is provided in the project's wiki page.
0,"�All variables, methods and class names look�reasonable."
0,"it follows the standard ruby practices . All the variables , methods and class name look reasonable. The added tests looks very clean"
0,Naming conventions are followed. Test coverage has increased.
0,Coverage has increased by 7 percent overall
0,The added tests look very clean.
0,Pull request build passes well and there are no issues.
1,"Most of the naming is reasonable and follows standard Ruby practices.� One problem is that code makes extensive use of variable names concatenated with numbers. Example: allow(participant3).to receive(:topic).and_return(topic) Here it is not clear what distinguishes participant3 from other participants and why it is special. It would be better to avoid using contractions such as stu1 or p1 (.sort_by_name method, Line 130). Furthermore, I would suggest using consistent�indentation�(for example .get_authorization method, Line 113)."
1,"The code looks clean. Though I don't understand why you have used this line in the test for responses "" puts participant.response_maps"". I feel some of the code that isnt�needed is commented out. Please remove this code as it was mentioned in the details. Naming and cnventions�seem to be fine."
0,"the code looks clean . However, some of the comments are not provided for the test cases. apart from this the naming and the conventions seem to be fine"
0,FuncyFunctionalare of correct length.
0,Does not apply as its a testing project with most testcases written in a single Rspec file to test the functionality
1,The test for sort_by_name redundantly checks implementation parts. It needs only to test the result.
0,"CodeClimate bot reports 73 style issues, which is an awful lot.�"
1,There is no need to use the student3 and participant3.
0,"Well, the code looks good and very much follows the Ruby Style Guide. The code also is DRY. It looks well written and does not any changes."
1,"The code is concise and readable. It consists of mostly small methods�that test one thing. One�exception is #.sort_by_name method where several assertions are made in one method. It would be better to use several 'it' statements and DRY out the code by utilizing before(:each) statement. One further suggestion would be to shorten the code by using one array statements instead of individual expressions. For example replace: stu1 = build(:student, name: ""Student1"") stu2 = build(:student, name: ""Student2"") � stu3 = build(:student, name: ""Student3"") with: students = (0..2).map { |i| build(:student, name: ""Student#{i}"") } �"
0,"Yep, the spec.rb file works fine. I think only handle method hasn't been tested. This is why the coverage seems to be 94%"
0,Yes all the features work as intended. The participant that is created using the build method describes participant as an instance of the assignment participant class. I observed the handle method has not been tested yet.
0,Video covers how to run the test cases which are clear and understandable.
0,Tests work
0,Some cases haven't been implemented yet.
0,"Tests in the file pass, according to the video, but less than 100% coverage implies that corner cases aren't being handled."
0,"No, the test failed."
0,"Yes, after testing the work manually, I could see that their features are working as intended."
1,Features implemented in this project work as intended. After running the code manually I am getting the same coverage as stated on the wiki page. One problem is that the main object under test - participant is created�using build method. factories.rb describes participant as an instance of AssignmentParticipant class. There is a possibility that this is complicating test cases or will complicate them in the future. The solution is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the code itself.
1,"The Wiki is descriptive and covers the essentials of the project. In my opinion, I think the code for every test is not required. It is enough to explain the structure and code for one test, maybe and what each test is supposed to do for the rest of the tests. That should suffice."
0,the document contains the whole information including the test plans and the the expertiza environment setup. It is neatly documented as well which makes it more readable
1,Project purpose is write test cases for participant model and increase the test coverage. This seems to be easily understandable but plan of work should nainly concentrate on how we test this functionality rather than just mentioning that test cases need to be written.
1,The doc says participant.rb model is� changed. However that file is not currently committed. However assignment_participant model file is committed. Seems to be some mismatch at one of the places. Correcting it will help in understanding what work is done and how does it impact the functionality.
0,The write is very descriptive and included code from both the model and the spec file.
0,The writeup explains how the tests relate to their respective methods.
0,very clearly writeup.
0,"It is well written, quite understandable. It clearly and adequately indicates the working functionality. I can understand what the project is about."
1,The problem being addressed by this project is defined cogently without any ambiguities. Test cases are considered separately starting with description of the given method followed by how the�functionality is being tested. I would suggest removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Expertiza) and rationale behind using Rspec (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/User_talk:Rshakya#Unit_Testing_with_RSpec)�because those parts fall out of the scope of this topic.
1,The test plan does not include details on preconditions or edge cases. I suggest the team to elaborate on Test Plan. Otherwise a good start.
0,Yes the test appears complete as they have mentioned all from setting up the expertiza environment to the tests that they have implemented along with the plan of the they executed their project
0,Test plan is not included however they have included the diffeedif test cases implemented and the exolaexplan is good.
1,�A more through explanation of what each testcase does will be useful. Its documented well about what the testcase will return but not what it does. Mentioning that will be useful
1,"The test plan could be more specific. For example ""Writing testing conditions for different functions"" doesn't indicate what strategies are being employed or what edge cases are being tested."
0,"The document states they have a 77% LoC coverage, but the assignment description states they need at least 90%. This is not complete."
0,"Yes, the Test Plan looks complete and includes all the test cases and the actions."
1,"Scenarios that are discussed in the wiki have comprehensive descriptions and justifications. However, clearly a number of edge cases are not considered as the test coverage is ~77%. � I would suggest using mock objects which will both decouple tests from database and increase the overall coverage.� For example mocking find_by method of TeamsUser would allow covering participant#team case: allow(TeamsUser).to receive(:find_by).with(user: student).and_return(team) � Another minor issue is that wiki is missing some cases that are implemented in the code (#team, #fullname, #scores)."
1,"They have mentioned that they use ""factory"", but it hasn't been mentioned clearly how they use factories. It would be great if they can incorporate this in the Wiki."
0,Yes the have mentioned all of the required work and its related explanation. they have reasoned out their exact methods and the issues to be considered while testing in the problem statement.�
0,Functionalities have been tested properly.
0,�Looks good. Explains what work is done and what is the corresponding output
0,"The writeup explains why the tests they write relate to their respective methods, but doesn't justify a 77% LoC coverage, which is below the requirements for the project."
0,"Yes, the writeup explains explains how the authors did their work and they have mentioned the steps behind each functionality. They have put a video explanation of the same."
1,"Authors describe the strategy they utilized for tackling the�project and the detailed mechanics of each test case. However, there is no mention of specific design decisions or patterns that were used in the implementation. My suggestion is for the team to elaborate on technical decisions made for simplifying�test cases for example the majority of mock objects is created at the beginning before every 'it' statement."
0,The test plan was not present. But the team have done a good job in implementing tests.
0,"Yes, it looks they have converted all the cases into the Test Plan."
0,The test cases have been developed into automated tests however edge cases or failing cases have not been considered. Only simple and straightforward scenarios have been tested. The video shows the test cases and the document shows the coverage. The document is well made.
0,Good work on including test cases. The app works fine after testing.
0,Yes most of them but they have not added any automated integration tests. Unit testing has been done and is great to see such detailed tests
0,All the test plan is converted to automated testing.
0,They did not have a Test Plan.
0,The variable and method names are apt.
1,Class and variables are name correctly. get_bookmark_rating_response_map is an not an apt name for a function. The word bookmark can be omitted in function and variable names inside the bookmark controller. .when a student requests a bookmark it should show a bookmark test is failing
0,"Yes. the variables have been very keenly named. Especially in the file, _rubric.html.erb, the variables are very accurately and effectively named, as there could have been much confusion otherwise. Kudos for that."
0,All methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. Only some of the code changes are explained and reason of taking a particular problem solving approach is lacking.
0,"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality."
1,"Build fails, pls look into it.� BookmarkRatingResponseMap has been replaced by BookmarkRatingQuestionnaire but the earlier naming convention just by looking at the name let the reader understand the data structure being used. I would have liked similar approach here.�� �"
0,The code follows standards.�
0,"Use of�a few variables is hard to understand. For e.g. :�x.assignment.id  Otherwise, most variables and classes are aptly named."
0,The code follows the DRY principle.
1,The code follows most of the standard practices except the 3rd one. It does falls short of comments. It took a very long time to make sense of what the changes made by the author in a particular file does. This scenario could be improved in the future iterations.
1,More comments are needed because I had trouble following what the code was doing in some places. The code follows Ruby Style Guide and is DRY in its design. Functions are small in size and naming conventions have been followed. Good work in this area.
0,"Great work. Clearly Understandable. Functions are of appropriate length, Codes are in appropriate�methods,�Code is very well commented, Code follows ruby style guide. Good naming. �"
1,Function names look good. And most of them have len < 20 which is good.� The tests make use of contexts effectively. This is great to see. � �Yes more comments are required especially in the controller code telling why an approach was taken and what the function does.� �
1,Code is clean and variable names are readable. Need a bit of formatting as some lines are not 'aligned' well.�
0,"�The code is well written, follows ruby guidelines and functions are of appropriate length. � No comments are provided what so ever, making the huge code change very difficult to follow."
0,They do work as intended.
1,Cases mentioned seem to be working fine. Can be a bit descriptive about the steps though.
0,All of the features mentioned by the author works successfully in the demonstration as well as in the manual tests performed by me.
1,The features work as intended however I am having trouble navigating and checking what are the differences between the original system and the improved system. Could have made a demo video showing the improvements or a step guide to follow.
0,Could not detect any flaws. Works exactly as it has been been in the wiki. Good guidance.�
1,"Yes.� I suggestion, since they deployed the code and video, it would have been good if they put a view of the UI usage similar to what they have put as screen shots in the code.� �"
0,"Tested in the links given, the changes are working correct. The server is up and I was able to reflect the steps mentioned.�"
0,"I can find where is the bookmarks page, but according to their screenshots I think their features work well."
1,The write-ups been written well. A small suggestion to the team would be to explain their solutions in more detail as it would better the understanding of what the project does. Also the team could use code snippets instead of screenshots of the code.
0,The writeup seems apt. I had a little problem understanding the solution to problem 1 but otherwise it seems fine
0,"The write-up is very clear and directs user to the main issue very well. The flow is very structured, in the sense that first it gives a high level view of what expertiza is, it then tells about the book-mark functionality, and then tells the problem and how they came up with the solution. One of the most professional wiki I've reviewed."
1,The method names and variable names are very well defined ! The best I have seen so far ! No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given.
0,The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does.� �
1,Write up is good. Great job. However I could find few points that if rectified would make it even better.� It would be good if the problem statement could list the issue (hyperlinks) that are being fixed. That would make it easier to navigate Instead of pasting screen shot for solution it would have been good if few words detailing approach would be put. Post that screen shot could be put. �
0,"Write-up�clearly explains with screenshots what is done. However, does not say how the changes have been implemented."
0,The test plan is not there.
0,They have included a test model video in which all the test are passing. It looks complete
0,"Yes. The test plan is present in the writeup. Also, the links to youtube videos for the demonstration was particularly helpful too."
1,"The Test Plan was comprehensive. However, in the video they could have explained which screens and which methods they were testing instead of just showing some test cases pass on the screen."
0,"The authors considered different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities and i clearly well written. Test Plan looks complete"
0,"Yes, I followed the youtube link to check the tests and they have tested the controllers.�"
0,Testplen�looks exhaustive and is explained well.
0,"They don't have Test Plan section, but they added some screenshots of the test result, I can see they have pretty good path coverage. But I can not know if they test edge cases or invalid input values without seeing their Test Plan."
1,The writeup is well written. But I feel there are some missing details about the project. The team could elaborate on the issues in the project and the solution that they have implemented. This way it would better in understanding how and why the authors did the work that they did.
0,It mentions what they did but doesn't highlight why they chose to implement that way. Don't seem to have implemented any design pattern as well.
1,"The writeup expalins clearly enough what the authors did. Though, the part of ""Why"" the authors did what they did isn't elaborated with much depth. From the authors perspective, the articles seems exhaustive and comprehensive, but for a person reviewing the article, who doesn't have much background of the problem at hand, the article make it tough to decipher why certain program is written the way it is.�"
1,"The authors do not explain why they did the word the way they did. Entirely new pages have been created with no indication as to why those pages were needed . Old redundant code has been commented but not deleted. Naming and code pattern wise, very good job."
0,"Writeup does not mention anything about how the code works, alternative strategies possible or strategies they used."
1,"The write-up only tells what is to be done and how it is done. The rational behind choosing the approach is not mentioned, neither are any of the principles mentioned.�It has comparisons between the previous and new versions and why they made they made the necessary modifications."
1,No. I think the authors should have mentioned why a particular solution was taken. What was the main driving force for taking the approach that they have taken. This was entirely missing. Pls work on that. They could also remove much of the commented code. � � � �
0,"Yes, the problem statement was explained thoroughly. Also, the team very aptly described why the issue needs to be fixed. great work !"
1,"I didn't find any information about how and why they did the work, they only show me what are the issues and the results after they fixed these issues, for example, in problem 2, they told me their is an average rating metric�bug and they fixed the bug, but they said nothing about how they fixed the bug."
0,"The write-up was splendid. All instructions were written thoroughly. I did not face any problem in understanding. Also, screenshots guided well"
0,There was no test plan. Also all the test cases don't seem to have been written which is evident since the code coverage 46 percent.
0,All the cases in Test plan are included in the automated tests.
0,Edge cases are covered as well.
0,"Yes, the admin has included the Test Plan cases in the automated tests.�They have solved all the issues they were tasked with."
0,They have added Rspec and Unit tests
0,The build is passing the test coverage and the bullet points mentioned in the issues section have been properly implemented to achieve the desired result. All the issues have been implemented as discussed.�
0,Test not passed
0,The chnages made by the author seemed to follow most of the guidelines that a professional prgrammer should follow. The variable names were unambiguous and clearly stated what they stood for. Also the functions and classes did what they stated.
0,The names are very intuitive and one can easily understand the reason for each of the variables from their names. In addition the test coverage has increased however it is not very good.
1,The test code follows standards. Context messages can be shorter and precise.�
0,All the names suggest the functions well.
0,"The code for the export_file controller and models for question_advice are tested adequately with the questionnaires_controller sepc model file. The variables, methods and class names follow the general standard Ruby practices.�"
1,"Except the comments, everything seemed to be fine. The code seemed to lack proper comments, and as a result of which, it took several seconds to determine why the author did what he did. Apart from that, the code seemed perfect. Functions were sufficiently long, and code was DRY enough too."
0,The code overall seems dry. The functions are to the point and the code follows Ruby Style Guide.
0,They have added new test cases and hence code is not DRY.�
1,"The team should add more comments for the codes include in the two issues, it is a little bit hard to follow what the author want to do without comments."
1,The code contributed by the author contains long functions which are adequate and consistent considering the amount of task that is carried by each function. The team could improve upon the comments to enable high understanding of the flow of code written. The code does follow the Ruby style guide and supports the DRY principle.
1,"The authors work seems to work fine in theory. But unfortunately, the link provided by the author does not work, and hence there was no way to manually test it. But the demonstration video provided was a big thumbs up."
0,Deployed link is not worKing
1,"The writeup was clear enough to be understood by anyone familiar with developing or contributing on expertiza. It provided a high level view, and then dug deep into implmentation, which is great since it saves time, and also look concise. But for someone outside the domain of expertiza, it feels too sudden of a transition that it takes time and in many cases other resources to figure out why the author did what he did. But the overall flow and structure was very great."
1,Excellent writeup. The instructions were clear. The screenshots were apt. One suggestion: Could be shorter and precise.
1,The document clearly explains not only the problem statement but also what Expertiza actually is. It proceeds to explain how they solved the problem of the rubric criteria.
1,"Yes, the author did include test plans and test cases. Also the test cases seem sufficiently exhaustive to cover most of the edge cases."
1,"Yes, the tests are thorough. Needs some formatting in the code."
1,The team has added test case for just one scenario. There is no test plan. It is advisable to add more test cases for all the methods in the sub classes to check if the existing functionality is not breaking.
1,The test is explained with the file used in the tabular form. It would have been good to attach a screenshot of the test if possible.
1,They discussed just 1 test case and did implement it. Some more corner cases can be thought of.
1,The query is well mentioned but I would suggest the sql be mentioned in the below manner for code clarity. Select ... From table name where condition;
1,Almost all variable�and method names are well-defined. Suggestion: Try to refactor method 'render_report' in module ReportFormatterHelper by using hash instead of really long case when statements.
1,review_response_map - can be modularize. Extract the various finction and write new methods for each.
1,the code is well written but few more comments before every function�could have made it easier to understand the code.
1,The features do work as per the mentioned functionalities. There are some suggestions mentioned and would be good to include test cases for the same in future.
1,No link to the application or a screencast of manual testing. � Suggestion: You can try to add screenshots of the testing performed and attach it to the writeup
1,"Yes, the wiki does explain the functionalities well. Could have been better to have more attributes in the subclasses in the diagram. This could help the user know about the details of the strategy pattern used."
1,"The test is added under the Test Added section and is well explained under the tabular form. Could have produced a screenshot of the test, if it was a possibility to generate. This helps the future teams to know what kind of test result to expect."
1,Edge cases missing from the test case. Write more test cases with invalid input types. Example - give a string to an int type and raise an error accordingly.
1,"Since the project involved deletion of obsolete methods and SQL, it would be good to explicitly state in the test plan if there were any tests previously that used these methods/SQL. Also, if they are present they need to be modified.�"
1,Authors have converted test plan into an appropriate test case. Suggestion: � The authors can improve the writeup if they elaborate more on the testing approach used for the newly added code.
1,"The team has done great job by describing the approach and explaining same in detail by adding a pictorial representation of the pattern used.�However, it would be more helpful if the team could add details about the names of the classes and the exact code changes done in the wiki page. As it would help anyone in future to understand what are the exact changes implemented. In this way the comparing code with the original code in github can be avoided."
1,Yes very well written. I would have given full marks if you would have added code snippet and screenshot of the before and after feature. Visually it would have been great to understand the changes quickly.
1,It would be�good if�the functionality of the obsolete methods(that were removed during the refactoring) is mentioned; and also explain why they were obsolete.
1,There aren't any test cases listed in the writeup. Can explain the test cases a bit in the github commit message.
1,Testing has been done well. Testing could have been more extensive. Currently the system only tests if the responses are correct for proper input. Blank or no input or failing cases should also have been tested.
1,No cases were mentioned in the Test Plan hence could not tell it is converted into automated tests. Please elaborate it. �
1,Naming looks fine. Could probably have used�is_submitted? instead of is_submitted.
1,All methods and variables are suggestive of the functionality. The vm_question_reponse table could have been named/edited to be named in a more descriptive way. I do not understand what is the meaning of VM.
1,"Everything looks fine, except for a few places where there are issues with indentation."
1,"A small suggestion , new_feedback --> author_new_feedback The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality."
1,grades_helper.rb:62 The parameter id is not descriptive enough. Please consider changing it to be more descriptive.�
1,Include test cases for negative scenarios as well.
1,"The code has comments at the beginning of the functionality. Could have added some more comments where the functions are larger for followup. Can add why a certain change in the fetching process was made, so that next time it can be referred while coding further."
1,"The team has done well to follow the Ruby Style Guide and has ensured to keep the code DRY. However, my suggesstion is to add comments in the code for the reader to follow the code easily."
1,"The comments were sparse. Maybe, coming up with a few words before every method would make the project more understandable."
1,Build is failing. Correct it by understanding the reason. Good job on Ruby standards for the naming convention.
1,The code seems to work for basic required functionality. Need to add more number of edge cases with test results where there is a possibility of a failure and a look into the work around is required.
1,The author's work runs smoothly. It could have been better had they provided a short demo video. I could not figure out where were the changes made in the system. They could have written the navigation steps. Directly giving the flow without any context is tough to understand.
1,"I would only suggest you to add more comments to your code. I know that no comments were previously added for you to feed off of, but I guess a major aspect of these OSS projects is to add as many comments as possible to the existing code."
1,"method�remove_instructor is written twice in the same file, delete it."
1,Team has written a professional and understandable writeup. Formatting is good. With good explanation of the approach taken to solve the issue. Creative way of writing before and after of the code snippet. Team could have added pictures to make it more relatable for users new with Expertiza.
1,Well explained. Add screenshot of the changes which can help understand the change visually.
1,The writeup was written well enough to how and what the project does. The only suggestion is to include screenshots. That would make the write up even more easy to understand.
1,"Difficult to test and review the work one since there were no screenshots provided. I was not able to find an instance of a review which could be submitted as a team but not by individual members of the team. Some of the webpages crash after clicking on a particular assignment to view the review report. Suggestions: The team could explain steps to access the ""review view"", so that manual testing could be done. The team could create dummy assignments for testing. Maybe, adding screenshots would help in the process."
1,"The document clearly explains what was the problem and what was the solution they proposed.They have also compared and contrasted with the previous solution which is good. They have talked about how different roles come into play with respect to security perspective and what the pros and cons of having/not having those roles. Comparing the code changes gave a clearer view of the code changes. One improvement could be in the 'background' part.� Taking it as it was: The majority of the project was related to solving issues regarding the deletion of Administrator and Instructor accounts. Administrator and Instructor are both account types that inherit behavior from User but are (1)handled and deleted in different codepaths. Furthermore, properties are used on a User that aren't on an Administrator, (2)such as team ids or course associations� (1) The different codepaths could have been shown to get a better view (atleast a screenshot, considering it wasnt within the problem scope) (2) Although, why these properties arent on Administrator is defined in the forthcoming sessions, it was little unclear while reading it. (It could have been quoted that 'as we will see it in the forthcoming sections')"
1,"Yes, test plan is complete enough also team has explained the test plan technology to used to achieve it. Good knowledge of Capybara testing. Team could have added test scenarios for each issue step by step rather than single lines."
1,"The test plan is missing in the wiki page. The content in this section could be the one suggested in the above comment, to just include all the test cases added and write a brief description about each."
1,"I think their introduction and issue sections clearly shows what�functionality the work is related to, they also add some screenshots which help me understand what they have done. But I can not understand what is bookmark and what it is used for, I think it is difficult for someone like me who have not used bookmark to understand these with only a short description. If they can write something more about bookmarks it will be better.�"
1,Include the code snippet in the write up as well.
1,"Test plan is included in the Writeup section. They have explained about the basic test cases and how it is implemented. Edge cases, invalid inout values arent explained in the writeup."
1,"The authors concisely explain the work they did. As a suggestion, I would ask them to include the tests written in the wikipedia page as well. The idea is for any reader to understand 100% what all happened in the project, without looking at the code."
1,"� Yes they have a test section. The amount of coverage added for the new tests is great. Keep it up, however I would have liked that the authors added more negative cases as part of t heir unit tests.� I see mostly the +ve test cases being handled in the tests.� �"
1,"The writeup includes their thinking methodology and why they arrived at that solution. 'Changes'�under 'User Deletion' clearly explains what went wrong in the existing code and what should be added. One suggestion would be, instead of showing 'Before' and 'After', they could have leveraged Git s UI version of + , - in red and green to have shown the differences. But 'before after ' way worked too !"
1,"The explanation is quite good to tell what is the current and the required functionality. The screenshots placed are not complete, as in they cut the code at the right end. Instead I would suggest to placed the github link to the code changes, so that the wiki becomes shorter and you can explain each code change better in the wiki. Also, the reviewer can compare the code with your explanation properly if he has the link to the code."
1,The write up is okay but could be a bit more descriptive. Could have provided screen shots of the changes to help reader understand better. No initial instructions on where to get started.
1,"This project is on implementing a single rejoinder per team for reviews instead of per participant reviews and also makes the feedback link for reviews more accessible. The writeup explained the background about Expertiza and the motivation for the project. It then moved on to list the tasks that were implemented and files that were modified in the project. It showed the current and new implementation clearly. The writeup, however, could have quoted the tests done using RSpec and the UI, instead of plainly mentioning the that the tests were modified to suit the current implementation."
1,I was able to understand what the project does to a certain extent. The writeup could have been more eloborate with views/snapshots of the page before and after the changes.� It adequately indicated what functionality the work is related to.
1,"The team has mentioned the problem statement and the methods which they have implemented to solve the problem.� However, there is a difficulty to follow the workflow since there are no screenshots attached or any video link provided. The team could improve this by adding a screenshot of the updated workflow below the changes shown in the writeup"
1,"The team has written a well structured write-up, but it lacks depth in certain areas. There is need for more background on what an author feedback is. The project description gives a better idea. Please try to include details from there. The last sentence under the 'Motivation' head, ""You should change this to list the team�s collective feedback to its reviewers to a particular assignment"" is a bit confusing. Please rephrase the sentence so as to add clarity to it.� � Instructions on how to manually test the functionality is missing. It was difficult to figure out how to navigate to and test the functionality. It would be really helpful to add this in the wiki."
1,"There is a separate testing section in the writeup, but it does not have much explanation. Could have added a couple of test case explanations. Also, a screenshot of a passed test case could work wonders."
1,The authors have considered various preconditions but edge cases are not tested. No test plan has been provided. Some tests have been edited to meet the new requirements. Many conditions have been checked using 'if else' cases which could have been more elegant.
1,"The test plan section just states that the existing test cases for feedback per member is fixed to satisfy the new feedback per team implementation. It would have been effective if specific pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values etc are handled. For example, in this case the input with missing team id or one member teams can be used as good candidates to test the implementation."
1,The test plan does not look complete. It just says�Fixed the existing test cases for the review feedback by a team instead of a team member. Could have mentioned the edge cases and how they tested it.
1,The authors have just mentioned that the test cases were updated. It would be good if the code diff for the test case modification were also provided so that we get an idea about the kind of changes made.
1,"The writeup mentions about the changes done in the code but not how and why it was done. Instead, the team could explain each code change more and give a link to the code change(from github)"
1,Could have been more eloborate. No mention of design principles or patters used.�
1,"The team has explicitly mentioned the classes and the name of the files where they have made changes. However, i would suggest the team to add the filenames above code snippets that they have attached in the write-up. This would make it easier for the reader to follow the workflow."
1,"The write-up has detailed how the author has done the changes. But it fails to address why the particular direction was taken, in some cases. It would be good to elucidate on that as well. In ' Solutions Implemented...' section, it would be good to include the names of the files before each code snippet and not just the description so that it is easier for the reader to relate.�"
1,"The test cases are cleanly written following good practices. Some of the indentation needs to be adjusted to contain better readability. Also, within the menu_rpec file, you are essentially testing two classes Node and Menu. I am not sure why that is. Is the node class and inner class of menu?�Maybe these two classes should be separated into different rspec files to ensure a better naming setup. Maybe this could be clarified in the wiki so that readers would understand the design choice. Overall great work."
1,"Most of the codes are well strutted, but something like ""returns an equivalent item"" is long and it is better to separate them."
1,"The team has introduced the functions clearly, but it may be better to also include the introduction of expertise itself. Besides, the motivation is general, add some specific details for this project would be better. As far as I am concerned, for the functionality of the menu, the introduction is also a little bit general. Adding more details about what the function of the menu, so we can know clearly what should be tested and if the test is enough."
1,"The overall purpose of the project, the need for mocks/stubs, and the scenarios of each test case are very well presented; however, there is little explanation about why certain tests were implemented in any particular fashion. It would be a�nice addition to include a few of your test cases and explain your reasoning behind why/how you implemented that test case. Adding this would further clarify your design/testing plan choices and make for a fantastic read."
1,Please make sure code like puts X is avoided. Remove them and commit the code again. Builds are failing. See the Travis�CI build details and�code climate errors and fix them
1,"Function, variable names are ok but there were ruby coding style issues like not using elsif blocks, not keeping code concise and�not following ruby syntax.� Scripts for converting non UTF-8 files is a good approach."
1,� Convert�if�nested inside�else�to�elsif. Unused variable�key inside remove_non_utf8 method.� �
1,"1) No, function length is good 2) No. they are apt. 3) comments are not included, which makes it hard to follow, as the changes are not regarding functionality rather than system implementation, comments should have been elaborate and detailing why the change is done 4) Yes they did 5) No. the code was DRY and reused efficiently"
1,Cannot test the code as the application is not opening and the videos uploaded are binary files.
1,"http://152.46.18.195:8080 � is not working. Also, the video is not running, Please upload in youtube."
1,The written explanation is good. Add few screenshots�of the change to be able to understand the changes done visually.
1,"Yes it explains with clarity the issue at hand, UTF-8 only support & how that causes trouble. Also improper formatting of HTML tags."
1,"The document directly dives into issue, they could have provided more information on different scenarios that are currently facing the said issue and its magnitude. This could have been helpful to counteract the problem in the future in other scenarios"
1,They have included test plan but few examples and screenshot of their work would have been a plus point.
1,"Testing is done manually and there is mention of automated tests in the wiki but no files are seen. It's better to provide all links like github code, testing videos and wiki while submitting on expertiza. �"
1,The folders/binary files in the drive cannot be played. Can you upload the video on YouTube so that it is easy for everyone?
1,"Yes, it does explain but could have added more details to make it clear.�"
1,Proper naming conventions are followed for variables and methods and classes. The only thing I think can be improved is dummy names for files and hyperlinks.
1,"There are some duplicate codes could substitute with ""before"" statement. For example, line 100 are exactly the same with line 108, it is better to use ""before"" even if there is only one line duplicate.��"
1,Overall the team has done good job in maintaining Ruby Style guide. The team could add more comments and reduce code redundancy in scores() method.
1,"I feel that they have achieved a 100% test coverage, although the design principles or patterns used haven't been listed. Listing that would help understand the testing strategy used."
1,"Since it's a test project, there are not much design patterns to follow, but they should list what tech they used to test the rb file."
1,The authors mention that they have followed DRY Testing practices but there are few test cases where they have not� implemented it. For example scores(questions) method. I would recommend to make the use of factories. Overall well written test cases. �
1,"The test plan is too elaborate and doesn't exactly cover different pre-conditions, edge cases, invalid input values, and other possibilities under the corresponding headers. Please include this as it improves the readablity and understanding."
1,"The Wiki has all the relevant information though I feel it needs to be a bit more organized. The titles and order need to change. The content needs to be placed at proper places. For example, test plan lists all the test cases and code, which�according to me should be covered in the implementation."
1,"The wiki talk about what they have done throughly, it could be better if they have mention about how they do that.�"
1,"The writeup describes briefly and clearly what the AssignmentTeam class does in the expertiza project. It has also given the details on the test plan, test cases and explained the use of RSpec testing framework and factories. I would suggest to add a link to their video that shows the tests running in the wiki page. All in all good work!"
1,There is no Test Plan yet implemented in the wiki documentation. Be sure that when you include this section that you make the inclusions specific and intentional.
1,The team has not included a Test plan that models their tasks for running the test cases. It should list the overall procedure adopted by the team from scratch to getting the tests running.�
1,"I am unable to find the file review_response_map_spec in the github repo that was supplied. However, there was a ruby file that was attached in the submission. The variable names are also clear and unambiguous. This file is incomplete but the tests that are complete seem to follow appropriate syntax and guidelines. I would suggest to add some describe and context blocks that would clarify the purpose of each test case rather than just have the it statement saying the name of the method being tested. Keep working to finish up the remaining tests in this fashion and it would be great."
1,The functionality added to the pull request is reaonable and makes use of appropriate keywords. It could be improved by giving names according to convention like feed_ back_ review_response_map could just be feed_back as jt is part of the review response map model file.
1,The code seems to set up a large list of factories only to then in many cases make these redundant by creating mocks for each test case. It is unclear what the code is trying to do and many of the test cases are large with many mocks with stubbed methods. It would be helpful if explanation for the code was given. When using factories it is generally unnecessary to stub the all the methods of these factories as they are in fact actual instances of the class. The code not very DRY. In many the cases the mocks and stubbed methods could be moved to a before_all or before_each block.�
1,"Except the lack of comments in the code, the code seems to be perfectly fine. Could be improved in that scenario."
1,"As mentioned in the above comment, Add these describe and context statements to further comment on the purpose of your test cases. This makes it easier to understand the why the test is there, I also find that it helps to clarify to the developer that the test is necessary."
1,The code written by the team includes the basic functionality needed to run the test cases. Some improvements might include keeping a function short like diving the import function into multiple contexts or reducing reduntant code by using the mock built.
1,Many tests are not yet implemented. More testing of the author's work in handling edge cases will be done in round two of reviews.
1,"I believe the wiki is not complete. However, the content that is included so far does aid in the explanation of the project purpose. More elaboration and completion of additional sections such as the testing design and implementation of tests will help to fully clarify the project purpose to the reader."
1,"The writeup is sufficient in itself, but not as exhaustive or easy to understand from the perspective if an outsider. The author could have elaborated more on the problem statement, and how it related with expertiza. Also, instead of directly jumping to the implementation, the author could have explained a little bit more about why and what was the approach taken by the author."
1,The Write Up can be improved by explaining all the Methods which are tested
1,The wiki document for the project does not provide enough details about the project and the task performed by the team. It contains of only a rough overview of the project at this stage. It does not reveal much about the functionality of the program.
1,There is not a specific Test Plan section in the wiki. There is a Work to be Done section that discusses the work that should be completed for project success. I would suggest rearranging or rename this section and continue to describe your plan of attack for testing.
1,"There is a section titled Test Plan. However, it does not seem to be a plan or give an outline for the development of the code. Instead it describes what the methods do, but shows the testing code for the method. This is confusing as no explanations are given for the coding design."
1,The writeup does not include the Test Plan section. It is suggested that the team add the section and include a number of different aspects such as specifying the edge cases and preconditions considered while working on the test cases.
1,"Little explanation for the code is given. The only case in which code is explained comes in the section titled Test Plan under the subsection Mock Instance. Here, it is mentioned that the project uses mocks to aid in testing functionality. However, the code example is actually of factories, a different but related concept. It is unclear if this is a typo or a misunderstanding because in later code snippets mocks do appear."
1,"The writeup lists the task to be performed under the Work to be Done section. It enlists the criteria required to be achieved as part of the project submission. The team can adopt a workflow that can give details about how the team managed to reach the current implementation such as understanding the files involved, steps taken for setting the expertiza environment etc."
1,covered all the edge cases but have not provided any explanation.�
1,"There�are some instances of variable names that are concatenated with numbers, for example answer2, questionnaire2 etc. While this approach can be justified in some cases, I would suggest using more descriptive names instead or arrays if multiple instances are required. For example team could be used instead of team1 because that is the only Team instance variable in the source code."
1,The code does follow all the standards and steps to cover all the test cases. Could include some more comments to make the code self explanatory.�
1,"The source code is mostly following standard Ruby practices, but there is a room for improvement. Firstly, the source contains large chunks of code blocks that are commented out. I would suggest removing those chunks as they reduce the overall readability. Given chunks can always be�retrieved via commit history. Secondly, some application level objects like Answer or Criterion are used to create corresponding instances as opposed to mocks. It would be better if the authors either used mocks or provided the reasoning for this decision."
1,"Code is nicely written and runs well. However, more edge cases should be included. For example, each function should be tested for a known success case and an edge case or potential failure."
1,"The wiki looks too long with a lot of code. It does have all the code and test cases, but its better to have git links to each code and more explanation of the code used above it in the wiki. This will help the readers to compare the changes in the code with the explanation parallelly."
1,"The wiki page is divided into some nice sections, however the authors have just included the code as it is without any description of the work that they have done."
1,"�Its a good write up, additionally you could try to explain method and test rather than including all the test cases"
1,"The wiki defines the primary goal of the project but it does not contain a discussion about the plan or strategy that is utilized to solve the problem. Raw code is copied from review_response_map.rb and review_response_map_spec.rb files, however this does not give the reader any useful information.� I would suggest replacing the review_response_map.rb code with a short description of what the team needed to understand about the given code in order to write the test suite. Furthermore, the team can provide a listing of higher level method descriptions from review_response_map_spec.rb, what are the expectations and which mock objects are being used to achieve the result. One minor improvement would be removing parts like Expertiza description (http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/CSC/ECE_517_Fall_2018/E1850._Write_unit_tests_for_review_response_map.rb#Background) because it is redundant in this context."
1,"As this rubric calls for the need of a section - Test Plan, I suggest adding it and including the work done in that section along with why a particular test has been written."
1,"The Test Plan is not defined formally in the wiki. Instead the reader has to reason about the provided code itself. Given test suite covers every method of the object under test. ~70% Coverage is achieved. It would be better for the team to define the test plan and decouple it from the actual code. This could be done by firstly stating all the 'describe' constructs, methods that they are testing and secondly,�elaborating�by listing their descriptions."
1,"All the functionalities are listed and code also attached for the same. But, if the code changes were highlighted in color as in git, then its better comparable."
1,The wiki page is divided into some great sections that provide details about the project.�I appreciate that the team provided actual code snipits along with explanation of the test to afford the reader a deeper understanding. The first paragraph in the design section is a bit hard to follow. It would be helpful to have this explanation accompanied by the tests these stubs were associated with and/or the actual implementation of these stubs for a better grasp of their purpose. I�would recommend combining the test and design sections for a easier flow of reading and following test implementations. Thank you for the Results section of the wiki that wraps up the project and is an easy point of reference for the reader to see the outcome of the project.�
1,The wiki does not include any discussions about design principles or patterns that were used in the project.� One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite.
1,"The wiki for this project contains tons of useful information about testing and rspec. I am not sure that some of it needs to be explained to the current extent�(example: what unit testing and TDD is or the environment set up). They are nice to include but maybe less as the purpose of the project is not to educate on those topics. Overall, this wiki did an outstanding job of describing the purpose of the project."
1,"I felt the section ""conditions tested in menu"" could have been more verbose."
1,The code follows the DRY principle and the Ruby style guide for writing the test cases. The code could be improved by providing comments. The code contains optimum length methods and the variables and functions have been properly named.
1,"The tests describe the code they are testing not the behavior/functionality. Like for ""In this scenario, the controller_action attribute of the menu item is unavailable. In this case, the expectation is that a customized path�is assigned to the URL variable."" This just specifies what�variable�is being updated and I have no idea what workflow it represents. This is at least a brittle description for a test. Suppose tomorrow the variable is removed or some function ends up calculating the value, while the test it self might pass if the change was passive, the description is now stale and will confuse any user trying to update the tests.�"
1,The Menu test case violates the DRY principle. The team can make use of factories to get rid of code redundancy. Overall good work!
1,"All the names are intuitive and reasonable apart from ""drop_topic_deadline1"". The team need to change this variable name to something more precise other than that Good job following naming conventions!"
1,"Some functions have the same code deleted and added again which could've been avoided, like� schema.rb line 105 & 110, lines 741-743 & 745-747 and more lines similarly in that file"
1,In the code�topic_id1 and @drop_topic_deadline1 name doesn't seems to follow the ruby guide line and you should probably name them differently like first_topic_id and first_drop_topic_deadline.
1,"none of the functions are too long could find changes where DRY principle was violated the code follows ruby convention and guidelines Although the code is easy to follow , the team needs to add comments for the changes which is currently missing. Good Job!"
1,More comments are needed.
1,This section of the wiki is currently missing. When you write this section be sure to state why you tested certain cases in a particular fashion accompanied with code examples so that the reader can clearly see what was done.
1,The information provided is good but the page is not organised and the code is confusing. Team should work on improving the format of content(the way they are representing info).
1,"Yes, the project is to do 2 things : 1. Stop teams from dropping assignments very late / close to deadline 2. Have different deadlines when assignments are done at different periods. The wiki should be created on expertiza page and not on wikipedia site."
1,"The code you have added in the write up isn't indented, its hard to understand this way. You need to make the write up more readable."
1,"The wiki is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. The screenshots can be included in the wiki and the code pasted in the documentation could be formatted. The team also need to inlcude the test plan section in the wiki. Apart from this , the team did a great work.� �"
1,"Good, but lacks readability. The code is directly copy-pasted�in the approach�section. You could have used the pseudo code with proper explanations. The structure and formatting�should be improved."
1,Write up doesnt include test plan. Good thing would be include the testing steps they have performed. Few screenshots would be helpful as well.
1,"Writeup doesn't has a test plan but in the video they have tested�a lot. Also please add audio as well in your video explaining what you are doing and why so that its easy for the user to understand, otherwise watching 23 minutes silent videos is just to much."
1,I don't see any new tests
1,Crashed for me once randomly. Might be not because of these changes but I am not sure
1,set_proposer is a setter but appears to be used as a getter.
1,"Authors could use empty? instead of checking unityId != ''. Another thing that the authors have taken care of ttml mails but what if the somone needs to non-html mails.� attribute copy_of_all_emails does not look like a good name, it would be nice if they could rename it to email_copy_all or so this help in reader understand as well as in ide intellisense.� Code coverage has decreased� � �"
1,"Commented-out code should be removed (at least one example found in participant_spec.rb). Also, there are some indentation issues as well as other issues flagged by CodeClimate. Otherwise, the code seems to comply with the Ruby Style Guide and be fairly DRY."
1,The code is appropriate but additional comments would make the code much more readable
1,"Comments in code are missing. There are few lines that need to be removed but still exist, it would be nice to delete those eg #emails << assignment.instructor.email� �Function length looks okay, most functions have len < 20 lines which is an acceptable number. Since the code is implementing very specific issues over it has specific local changes.� Other change are okay and ruby like"
1,The background and problem statement are clear and concise. The description of the implementation is thorough but a little too detailed. It relies too much on the source code and not enough on figures and written explanation.
1,"The write-up is well written along with the screenshots attached for the code changes which helps in explaining the issues and changes made to solve those.� Just one suggestion, if you are explaining all the steps and redirection for some issues/changes please keep the content consistent for other issues/changes as well."
1,Problem is well defined but the authors have listed 3 issues that need to be fixed but they have only provided 2 links in the problem statement. It will be nice if they can give the link to the third as well.� �
1,The 'why' part is missing for the code changes. What does each code line of change do? Maybe you'll can incorporate that.
1,"The writeup was fairly specific on how the solution was implemented, although more qualitative description should have replaced the source code dumps. The writeup barely explained why the improvements were needed, focusing on what was implemented.�"
1,"More of what is done is explained. Also, steps to manually test the instance could have been included."
1,"Yes authors have an details about code changes that they have done and why they have done. I would have liked more emphasis on ""why""�"
1,You could have made the empty method end on one line. I think _args could be named args.
1,"The testing of initialize is very well described with descriptions of how and why the tests were written in that particular fashion. However, all other tests are not discussed. When looking at the github it seems that there were many more tests that were not elaborated upon. The test descriptions were included at the bottom of the page but without explanation of implementation or purpose. It would be helpful to include more of the test cases. If anything, it would be a good idea to discuss them without the code inclusion like that of initialize because that section of the wiki is very well presented."
1,"There is no Test Plan section at this time. However, the authors did include some discussion of edge cases and the fact that the initialize function required testing of known success case and potential failure. I think that this is sufficient without the inclusion of a Test Plan section. I would suggest that since this rubric calls for the section to just rearrange the content of your current page. Also, include the additional edge cases that you have already tested for in the other functions possibly with some specific examples. This will allow for a more thorough Test Plan section."
1,The pseudo-code test plan does a good job of explaining the functionality of the tests without being clogged up by implementation details. I do suggest putting it closer to the top of the wiki page though.
1,"This doesn't apply here much as its just writing testcases. However some of the tests documented in Menu like Mean with role and without role are confusing. I had to look through the entire doc to figure out why is that written that way. It could be better to have comments as to why a particular test is written , what does it test and why is the expected output the way it is."
1,"Does not apply much.But instead of using names like temp and temp 1, a more significant name which is self explanatory of its content will be useful."
1,Rspec code looks good.Proper comments and good variable name usage are 2 things i will suggest to improve. Very good work overall.
1,"1) No, they have modularized well. 2) No 3) They could have provided more comments on tests where they set nodes at few places. 4) They could have used factories more extensively, due to various mock data they might have needed to cover different inputs 5) Their code can be more DRY, as they seem to repeat instantiations in all places"
1,Their tests are very straight-forward and can be extended to test few edge cases
1,"The whole wiki page is complete and neat, while it might be easier to understand if they reorder the test plan with other parts of the page."
1,Test plan is given a appreciable thought and team has also implemented test scenarios mainly in�student_task_controller_spec.rb Would�suggest team to try and increase test coverage.
1,"I could only see 3 commits with no significant file changes. I would request team to add and contribute the changes as soon as possible. With the present changed code, methods names and variables and class names are proper with reasonable naming conventions."
1,Link to the pull request is missing. Please add it.
1,"The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a liitle more desciptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb� they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities."
1,"@all_task vs @student_tasks  � The name 'all_task' does not sound appropriate. It should be student_all_tasks. � 1. all_tasks => student_all_tasks � 2. student_tasks => student_available_tasks � 3. current_student_tasks => student_current_tasks 4. past_student_tasks => student_past_tasks � � Also, the filename will_paginate_array_fix.rb�seems misleading to me. A better name would have been support_array_pagination.rb. � Also, I am not sure this file should be in the initializers, as it is just a require statement. May be this should be included in the places where the pagination is required, instead of loading it�during app initialization.� � � �"
1,In due_date_color switch case would have been a better approach�then if else if block. Lots of code that is done in view�can be moved to the controller. Follow MVC architecture.�
1,�The functions seem to be implemented in a good manner and the code seems to be DRY.. In some cases though the authors could have improved as in the i app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb� file. In side the due_date_color method they could have used case expressions in Ruby instead of the if else logic implemented as that would be a more Ruby on Rails way of doing it. As it will reduce the lines of code as well as being a more elegant way of handling it.
1,"In the due_date_color(due_date), instead of hardcoding the color vs interval, it would have been more useful if those are pulled from a config file. That will make the implementation more flexible � Similar hardcoding found in  1. list_student_tasks: per_page: 10 2. breaking_word_wrap: breaking_word_wrap(student_task.assignment.name,40 ) � � Use of inline CSS element, could have avoided by using a simple css class. Such harcoded stuffs make the view strongly coupled with the style elements, which could have been avoided. <hr style=""height:2px;border:none;color:#e3e3e3;background-color:#e3e3e3;"" � Also, the UI changes are not showing up properly aligned. Please see the attached screenshot �"
1,I feel some comments can be added before every function for the code to be understood better.
1,Can not find any video or link or Ip address link to manually test the changes. I would request team to deploy the changes so that we can test the system partially.
1,Can't test as the link to the deployed application is not given nor the screencast video link is provided. Please include either of them.
1,"Student dashboard � Please see the dashboard. The UI elements are not properly aligned. The title ""Current Assignments"" is not where it should be.�"
1,Writeup is readable and written properly. Team could have added code snippet and pictures of changed or improved functionality. Also team could work upon formatting and could also add links and references.
1,The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. The project changes to the code have been described in paragraphs which could have been better if they could have updated with code snippets and screen shots of the tasks at hand.
1,The writeup is clear. It is easy to understand what the project does. It would be better if you can put in more code details and major pieces that do the important logic.
1,"It feels like test plan only covers one aspect - ""changing of the background color for tasks as we approach the deadline."" � here are other aspects which can be automated for testing, perhaps by Rspec or the likes:  Add past due assignments to the student�s task list (on Student View). -- Verify if they are being added/saved Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignment�s due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the �Past assignments� list to the �Current Assignments� list if needed) --- Check if the functionality works. On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box. -- test if this works Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classe"
1,"Yes, Writeup explains the approach taken by team to solve the issue, theoretically. Team could have explained the issues and resolution practically. Also no design pattern or principle were used."
1,It only explains how they did but not why they did. The various approach could have been mentioned in the WIKI.
1,The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They should have� explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.
1,"It is better to state the change of the feature or added feature with diagram to show the difference, to state what remains the same and what is added or update understand certain circumstances.�"
1,Functions are named properly.
1,"The functions are not too long so the code doesn't have to be extracted into separate methods. More comments�could have been added for easy understanding of the code. The code follows the Ruby style guide and the code looks refactored, statements ""unless"" keyword are written in a single line."
1,The author's work is implemented well and is implemented as expected. Few edge cases can be written to test the code completely.
1,"Yes, I was able to understand the issue as well as the solution overall. But I couldn't understand why there is a need to append a team name to an assignment. It was just mentioned that it is done in other part of the code as well. Mentioning that would have given me a better idea."
1,"The write up has been written well. There's obviously some additions possible to the write up. The code changes/additions have been shown, I would recommend description of why those changes/additions were made. I would also suggest the team to standardize the size of their screenshots.�"
1,"The how part is clear. As to the why part, thought they have clearly mentioned the the problem statement, i think a little bit more of an explanation could go into why is that actually a problem."
1,Could not see test plan as well as automated test cases are not included Team could work upon adding test cases to test the functionalities. That would make the issue resolution more robust.
1,"Some checks fail in the build. But I feel that few checks are much intricate (one failed because of a score of 15.07/15) and can be neglected. The TRAVIS CI Build error was faced by many teams too. The namings are not unclear or ambiguous. goto_controller('Questionnaires','3') goto_controller('Review','3')  �"
1,"The code is well written and very understandable Newly defined function parameter name is�self-explanatory Suggestion: 1. Rubric Array can be declared outside the function, so as to follow DRY principle.� 2. Meaningful comments can be included for the function definition in tree_display.jsx, explaining what does the tree_display represent"
1,The code is nicely written 3 More comments needed 5 Not DRY in one place (rubric array definition) � Suggestion: � 1. Simply define a getRubricArray function to return the rubric array wherever required.
1,"After manual testing, issue 1 seems to be fixed and reflects the changes properly. Nothing seems to be done to fix issues 2 and 3 of the problem statement. Suggestion: 1. You can include any approach or design of functions to resolve remaining 2 issues in the writeup"
1,"The Fixes Required part has been explained well with the cause of the issues. But, more light�could be shed on what the formative and summative rubrics are."
1,Writeup is written well. Understandable and clean explanation. Team has explained the problem statement and issues well with good amount of pictures. Team can improve on formatting.
1,The writeup was written well enough to understand. Screenshots were also attached along with the steps making the documentation better. Can definitely understand what project does and how it is done.
1,"The wiki is well written and contains all required information for issue 1. The documentation for other issues still needs to be included. Apart from this , the team did a great work.� �"
1,"The writeup is lucid enough to explain the details of the issue and how the system works after fixing it. Suggestion: 1. The authors can add a section on testing, explaining about how the issue fix can be tested. 2. They can improve the readability by mentioning issue numbers (from document issued by the prof.) on the write-up. It will save time of the reader to go through the document and map which issue has been fixed."
1,"� I could not see any test plan. Team could work on writing test plan and implementing�the same for the issues resolved. Also where team is failing to implement some functionality, as future scope, they can try design the solution and also test cases for the same,"
1,What and how explained well but they explain the why behind their actions a bit more.
1,"Writeup is written well. No design principle or pattern involved, But the approach taken is explained in detail, step by step.�� Team could add references and links. �"
1,"The writeup�explains the problem statement well, but fails to explain the approach and just have pasted their code. It also fails to have a reasoning behind the approach they chose. Suggestion: 1. The author can describe how they came up with an approach starting from analyzing the issue. This will remarkably improve the writeup. 2.�The author can talk about atleast one more approach to fix the solution and explain why they chose a particular approach for implementation. �"
1,"As mentioned earlier, they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence, we are assuming that they are to implement testing at a further point in the project. Of course, mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped.� �"
1,The Test plan is not a part of the writeup. The team can improve upon this by following the general guidelines of writing the document. The test cases can be coherently designed following the Better Specs documentation. The team must have the test cases designed that span the required goals.
1,"The variables, methods and class names used do not justify the features performed and do not implement the desired functionality expected. Also, the code added does not improve the coverage of the files. The team should look towards using appropriate names and provide desired code segments to get a high coverage."
1,"The functionalities relating to Questionnaire have been moved to Questionnaire from QuizQuestionnaire which is very helpful. Suggestion: 1. You can try to create sub functions for code inside create and view, as they are really long functions"
1,"�(1)Functions are still long, save choice and save quizes are the top two, consider increasing more internal methods"
1,The code contributed does not follow the test rule in that the tests are made using create instead of build. The code functions do not implement much function and does not follow the Ruby style guide. The team should focus on getting the tests running by following the DRY principle.�
1,The writeup can be improved to begin with a short description of the project backgound so that anyone reading the writeup can understand what the project is all about.
1,"Unfortunately, no mention of the word ""test plan"" has even taken place in their whole Wiki page. So, it seems that they are yet to implement the testing functionalities in their project. Although, it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository. � �"
1,The writeup does not have the Test Plan section. They need to include it by specifying the section that describes the pre conditions considered by the team while working on the refactor review on the different question types from the uiz feature.�
1,The writeup should be written in a emore elaborative way clearly stating at the minimum - the problem statement; new implementation strategy; design principles; test plan and references.
1,"The writeup states correctly the changes performed, but fails to provide a reasoning behind every change. Suggestion: You can include reasons behind choosing an approach, for atleast one refactoring code change"
1,"It was difficult at first to understand why they are doing what they are doing. I feel that the information is right there, it just needs better elaboration and description."
1,"Not completely its lacking lot of informations, consider writing the code before and after the changes to explain the changes done"
1,The team needs to provide a list of sections including the test plan and unit test cases that would make it easy to refer to the pull request and the github code. They must also work on designing the wiki page making it easy to read and understand it.
1,The writeup gives a high level overview of the work done Suggestion: 1. You can try to make the write-up more illustrative by discussing which refactoring principles were implemented in which files and how does it make a difference. 2. You can take help of code snippets to make it more understandable.
1,Good description. I think with the use of headings and subcategories it will look good also need lot of conteent to mention the changes done
1,The write-up is pretty ambiguous and feels all cluttered up. Maybe elaborating on few lines and separating the one whole paragraph into bullet points under different headings would have made it more readable and clear.
1,I could not see any mention of test cases in the wiki or github. Team could add/mention test cases surrounding the change that lead to checking the changes in this merge.
1,"Testing for the UI changes has not been done. Maybe they were not supposed to, but if they were, more documentation in the wiki would be helpful."
1,"There is a change in the colour code required, so there was not much of a naming convention to be followed here. Dint find any instances in the attached code where name could be changed. One instance of�is_submitted could be changed to�is_submitted?"
1,The naming looks fine in html file. Although your pull request shows changes in schema.rb file which i don't think you have used any where or had to make changes int it. Probably is went through by default when you pushed your changes. You might want to revert that from the pull request. That way I think your build will also pass.
1,�The color combination could be changed for buttons. Maybe for someone who has a difficulty while differentiating colors (me) faces a lot of problem.
1,Code does follow the conventions. Just that the comments could be better explained for the functionallity
1,"1. Code is simple and written efficiently without long functions, unnecessary looping or dead code. 2. Shown snippet itself is well modularized and no need to be written as separate methods 3. Code is well understandable. 4. Code does follow ruby style guide. 5. Code follows DRY principle. �"
1,"I couldn't login to the deployed website since there were no credentials which I could use. Perhaps the wiki page should have included the credentials for logging into the deployed website. However, from the screenshots it seems that the functionality works."
1,�The page is complete. Only thing which I mentioned is a good color combination is needed.
1,Writeup is written very neatly and in elaborated fashion with understandable images. Team could have added Github Expertiza link and pull request link at the bottom of the wiki page. Also�references and credits.
1,"The write up has not been formatted well, most of it consists of what can already be read from the OSS assignment specifications document. I would strongly suggest the team to include screenshots of their commits instead of using wiki code formatting."
1,"The write up is well documented. There is a clear flow from the code change part to the screenshots of the implementation. It would have been better if there was a screenshot of the code from git or a link to git so that the code changes would have been more defined as per the green and red colour. Also, the code change could be explained more."
1,"There is no separate test plan section, but the test functionality has been shown in the form of screenshots. Could add it under the Testing header in the document so that the code and test would be separeated."
1,"Project does not have test cases included, hence can not check further functionalities. If team is not able to add test cases for exact change, team could add/mention test cases surrounding the change that lead to checking the changes in this merge."
1,"Team has used in-style tags to add CSS styling in HTML pages. They instead need to create an external CSS, define the styling there and use the class names in HTML tags. This provides styling maintainability throughout application."
1,"The writeup clearly explain why the team did the work that they did. Good job on that. The only thing I may have preffered to have as a reviwer is a detailed step by step instruction on how to view the changes made by the team in the app. This could be added in the wiki, or a short screencast could me made to help follow the steps."
1,"Yes, the code change along with the screenshots does explain the ordeal, but the git screenshots and some more explanation would be well appreciated."
1,The tests have been added as per the test plan but some of them have not seemed to have passed. The team could have a look at the tests not passing and work on them.
1,"Code follows standards but variable names can be better and more 'readable'. Another suggestion: declare ALL variables first then use those variables to call methods. When you add/declare variables in between method calls, it looks as though you 'forgot' to declare earlier and added them later. Just a thought !"
1,"Some names are ambiguous, like pptn, I cannot know clearly what this name is for. �"
1,"Please extract all ""let"" to avoid the repeat code.�"
1,"For each cases, it include too many things need to be test, it is better to separate them into different cases. Also, the object used for this test seems not be put into the factory, it is better to make them into factory which is a good practice. The use of context is not good enough."
1,Including basic Understanding of the problem statement and work will help in manual testing.
1,The functionality has been written well. Though I do feel it would have been better if the test cases implemented had been explained in more detail as to what the do.
1,More details required regarding the functionality for which the test cases have been written.
1,"Yes, the team has taken care of it by specially making a section of what is the problem as the introductory section of the WIKI doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have even attached code snaps of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error. Although, one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution. More mentioning of details is required.�"
1,The writeup has proper instructions but needs some improvements: 1. Explain the problem statement� 2. Explain 'why' you need the solution 3. Explain the steps you took. The code snippets are added but could be improved by adding explanation of the tests. May be adding 1-2 lines can help.
1,There are not enough introductions about what the functionality of the class they will test and what it is used for. The team can introduce more about what expertiza is and what the role of the class will be test and its functions.�
1,�Test plan documentation is missing currently. Plan will help to relate with the code and understand if things are tested appropriately and the response is as expected or not
1,"Yes, they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the wiki doc.�They have vaguely described the handling of the same, but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code.�Which�means that a better job�and�a more technical description of how�It is happening should be given so as to grasp a�better understanding for the same.� �"
1,Need a bit of detailed explanation on 'why' and 'how'. Too many screenshots with little explanation in words.
1,The motivation is not enough. It is a little bit simple and general. The team should add the introduction to the specific motivation for this project.
1,"The team has implemented automated tests. There could be some addition to the test, which I have suggested above."
1,All the cases discussed in the Test Plan have been converted into automated tests.
1,"The variables, methods and class names are aptly named. I could not find names which are not suggestive of functionality. (i) The writeup is well written and easy to read.  (ii) It is adequately descriptive of the work done.  (iii)�Explanation of reasons for the style of code and problem solving approach is lacking."
1,"The features work correctly, as expected. The instructor login only has one ""Student View"" tab under the Manage menu. On clicking it the instructor is successfully redirected to the student view page which has the ""Close Student View"" button to redirect to the default view.�"
1,all the scenarios including the corner cases are working fine. No issues or problems were found with the functionality. The only issue is related to the CI built which is failing at the moment. The team needs to analyse the root cause related to the build failure and fix it. Other than that it was a great team effort!
1,"""Switch to student view"" - But to which student? Open and Close student view is handled on clicking it to switch the type of view. Same changes (to delete session[:student_view]) need to be done�on logout in auth_controller as well.I logged in as instructor6,�clicked on ""Open Student View"" and logged out. When I login again as instructor4, I must still see ""Open Student View"", but I see ""Close Student View"" while I'm not in the student view at all since I just logged in..."
1,"Yes, the team has considered the two important and required test cases- 1) To check whether ""Assignments"" is not present in the Instructor view, and check the presence of ""Open Student View"" button in the flyout menu. Here, the team has also checked the precondition whether the user is viewing the correct page (tree_display/list) which is meant for the Instructor.� 2) To check the presence of ""Close Student View"" button for the instructor to return back to the default view and have the ""Assignment""� tab for students.� Suggestion: The team could add a line to check whether the system returns back to the instructor page after clicking the ""Close Student View"" button. maybe include : ""expect(page).to have_current_path('/tree_display/list')"" .��"
1,The writeup clearly explains the implementation details and why those changes were made. It is nicely articulated and leaves no ambiguity.
1,The write-up contains the information about how the solution was achieved. The details about why the solution was implemented in this way is currently missing from the documentation. The team should include the same in the documentation as well.
1,The project is about adding tests to the a model. So this is okay but there is not sufficient background on the model itself. More details would be good for the uninitiated.� Also they mention that the number of tests for the model were not sufficient. It would have been better if they would have quoted the code coverage numbers before and after.� � �
1,The�submission is about adding tests to the project� and authors have done a great job of adding 92% code coverage.� I would have liked to see more -ve test cases for example cases such as user with incorrect names. As of now the test cases only checks of the user name is present or not. How about the case where user name is such that it is not allowed. User class throws an exception or add method can. This could have been documented.�
1,I would have liked to see more use of context in the tests and grouping of similar test methods in context.� �
1,Could be better if contain with�more info about the test itself instead of the rb file they tested.
1,"Since it is a test rb file, there are not many variable need to be named.� The ""it "" part at line 362 in the assignment_team_spec.rb file, ""get max num"" could be better if substitute with ""get maximum value"" or something like this, max num seems little bit wired."
1,Writeup is very clearly explained. Writeup clearly explains how they are doing their work but why team is following approach is not explained.�
1,"The write up as well done. However, the write-up is missing the test plan.�"
1,"The writup�includes the work done. However, there is no explanation about why that�"
1,Please add the test plan to the write-up.
1,"As mentioned earlier, they have not considered testing at all at this point and hence, we are assuming that they are to implement testing at a further point in the project. Of course, mentioning an approach to the testing framework and how they would be going about it would have helped.�"
1,Code appears to work. Don't really know what edge cases there could be due to lack of a test plan.
1,"Although their documentation shows screenshots and their app is deployed on VCL, there was no testing plan/ how to test on application. There was no screencast too. So it poses a difficulty on how to see. But from the screenshots on the documentation, the features seem to work good."
1,The documentation is good but is missing the test plan and Instead of a word document write it on wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu so its easier to search and refer. �
1,"Yes, the team has taken care of it by specially making a section of ""what it does"" as the introductory section of the doc so as to make us understand the goals of the project. They have even attached screenshots of the relevant changes they have in mind whilst explaining the error. Although, one questions the details in which they should have gone into explaining the errors and resolution. More mentioning of details is required.�"
1,They have not created a wiki page but uploaded a doc file which explains the work they have done adequately
1,"The authors do a great job of explaining how they did their work, and but the why is sometimes not explained. That could be because it's largely self-explanatory."
1,"Yes, they have explained why they did that way and it was clear. They have compared and contrasted in each of their feature of ""Current Implementation"" and ""Solution"" which is a better way of showing what they implemented One more suggestion would be, it would have been good if they showed the difference in their code snippets too for the current implementation vs Solution proposed."
1,"Unfortunately, no mention of the word ""test plan"" has even taken place in their whole doc. So, it seems that they are yet to implement the testing functionalities in their project. Although, it would have been better if they had checked if the checks or the tests already existed in the first place in the git repository. �"
1,"Yes, they surely have done a good job in mentioning the errors in the 1st part and the second part. But it is unclear why the 3rd fix is a problem or how they have combatted the 3rd fix in the first place. It just seems so that a screen shot has been put into place and they displayed a No Method Error popup. They have vaguely described the handling of the same, but doubts remain in the details or the changes in the code. In fact, no code screenshots have been put up for this case.�"
1,Although the write up has all the details about how the work has been done and what solutions are proposed. There are no explanation about design principles.�
1,There were no testcases and since they provided a screenshot of the desired work. I suppose it fulfills the requirement
1,"The code is readable and no function is too long. Suggestion: The impersonating_as_admin? and impersonating_as_ta? function uses the same session variable, so you can try to declare it above these functions and reuse it to follow DRY principle"
1,The write up is good as I was able to understand the issue to be fixed and the implemented approach.� I would like to suggest the team to standardize the size of their screenshots though.
1,"The wiki is well written and contains all required information regarding the project. The only scenario missing from the documentation is the scenario where the TA is assigned to a instructor , what will happen to the instructors impersonated students when the TA of the constructor login to the application. Apart from this , the team did a great work.�"
1,"The writeup clearly explains the issues and the approach used to achieve the desired results. Suggestion: The authors should try to include the rspec test documentation, for the newly fixed issues."
1,They wrote clear and adequate description and I can clearly understand what their project does.
1,"The authors have included a series of steps to perform the test and have provided screenshots, but do not cover other possibilities."
1,The authors have documented the steps they did to solve the issues in a clean manner. Although they haven't mentioned any particular design principles or design thinking that went on in solving the issues. They have explained all the functionalities of each file they have modified and stated why they have modified the particular file. One thing they could have added were class diagrams and dependency maps. Or some pictorial representation of the flow of each task which will help the reviewers and instructors to quickly catch up on their idea.
1,"The writeup does emphasize on how the issues are resolved, however lacks a reasoning as to why did they choose it.� Suggestion: It is hard to follow the code, as there is lack of comments. You can try to include meaningful comments for every function you have introduced. That will increase code readability"
1,The write up is very well detailed with good information and pictures. Two things: 1. Put the write up on the expertiza wiki page instead of in a word document 2. On the wiki use the � tag to insert code snippets into the page instead of a screenshot of the code
1,All the test cases are passing however code coverage is low. Various different scenarios must be tested thoroughly. Travis CI build is passing and efforts were taken to work on this. Appreciated!
1,"A few tests were added, though I'd like to see more tests regarding edge cases or invalid functionality.�"
1,"The team has followed Ruby coding standard. However, function names could be refactored for example the function ""get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now"" name is just too long and can be modified into ""get_time_diff"" or any other meaningful name. Also, it is advisable to keep the function name singular or append the name with list; so instead of using ""find_participant_emails"" the team can use ""find_participant_email_list""."
1,The write up is well formed and structured. The entire flow is explained along with files changed/methods implemented in each stage. Could have described the approach a bit more.
1,Code convention for mail looks good but I found find_participant_emails misleading because it gets email for all participants and not emails for participant
1,more comments are needed for clearity .
1,"The code has been implemented in a modular fashion. However, the team can improve the readability of the code in mail_worker� and assignment_form. Currently it lacks readability because of too long comments between every line of code and poor alignment, which makes it difficult for user to understand."
1,"At several places, the code used a lot of nested if else statements and some methods were very long. These lines could have been refactored. Also more comments are needed that explain what a method/variable does (just good naming is not enough). The code is DRY compliant and follows style pattern well."
1,Function length is good. General convention of having function length < 20 has been followed. What I found lacking was additional 2-3 lines of comments before each new function to understand what has been implemented.� � �
1,The authors work functions well but the code uses redundant/bad logic in some places. Code could have been put into methods and reused. The code functions as expected in almost all cases
1,Yes features work as intended but I would like to see tests as well as testing case were job addition to queue fails. I understand this would be edge case and not likely to happen but still needs to be handled. Other edge cases such as�participant_mails is nil have been taken care of. �
1,"The wiki as well as a design document has been�created for the write up which�explains the�refactoring requirements. The team has explained the technical aspects in a very detailed manner. However, it would be helpful for users if the team could add more details about the functional aspects so that a end user can test the impact on the existing functionality due to the changes done."
1,The team has leveraged the existing test cases to align with the changes implemented. It would have been more helpful to include the test cases in the write up as well.
1,Existing tests have been modified to changed to pass for the new implementation.� News tests could have been added�
1,The team have explained why and how they did the work they did. Feel they should elaborate more on the tests that they have implemented.
1,Yes the authors explain the existing solution and explain the drawbacks for in them.� I would have liked to see a point wise comparison on how their solution overcomes the existing drawbacks.� I would suggest not to hard code the mail text/subject in the code and use a config file instead. This will be easy to modify in future. I would have liked if the authors added why they took sidekiq and not rabbitmq or celery �
1,Mostly looks good. Can change names like this�is_selfreview_enabled to is_self_review_enabled and assignment_form_assignment_num_metareviews_allowed to assignment_form_assignment_num_meta_reviews_allowed. selfreview shouldn't be a single string.
1,�Maybe some more comments will be helpful.
1,"The project has been explained in great detail. Just feel instead of using issue numbers, if the team had explained the issue in brief before elaborating on it, that would have been great."
1,-This whole wiki is for expertiza you do not need to explain what it is in the introduction -The snippet of code for issue 228 is an intimidating wall of text consider adding some new lines or splitting it up some -Do not just but a whole code file on the wiki (_review_strategy.html.erb) if I want to read this I will find it on the repo.
1,"They have explained every aspect of the project really well. Plus the video also show the changes they have done. One thing you can add is audio in your screencast videos, telling what is being done so that its easy for the user to understand."
1,"The test plan has covered various cases and completely explainable in simple terms Small suggestion, The first paragraph could have been itemized for easier understanding."
1,"Code looks good apart from a lot of commented code. If that is written by the team and was not already present, then it should be removed if not used before submitting pull requests."
1,The code has been modified to include the modifications requested (test cases added for failing scenarios and edge cases - two assignments with same name) in my previous review. Appreciated! Overall the code quality is good. Only some variable names are ambiguous for example: check_validate.� What does it validate? Name it like validate_same_name or validate_common_directory etc
1,"There are commits on a single day, that is yesterday. One suggestion would be to commit regular progress on the git.�"
1,"The code is well written but it can use comments to help explain what the code is doing. For e.g. the code below is hard to understand:           if quesparams[:assignment][:directory_path] == """" and quesparams[:check_validate] == ""on""             quesparams[:assignment][:directory_path] = ""#{quesparams[:assignment][:name]}_#{quesparams[                 :assignment][:id]}_#{quesparams[:assignment][:course_id]}""           end"
1,I do feel the code can be deployed to the production server once a few test cases have been implemented by the team.
1,"The suggestions have not been improved. Comments aren't explanatory and does not give an idea about what the author intended to do. It would be good to include meaningful comments. Debug code is still in the commit. Even though we may used debug code like the puts statement, we should not commit these as they could create junk data in the application log. Please consider removing them."
1,"I don't see any tests added by this team, although they do mention that their code additions were not particularly testable except with the existing automatic tests, which they enabled."
1,�It's fine to good. I wish y'all would have posted a link to your repo in stead of the pull request.
1,Some parts of the code are still left to be implemented
1,This system doesn't have a UI I can view as it seems to be a browser add on.
1,The wiki is quite comprehensive and gives the build steps clearly. It could also include a more basic explanation in layman terms about what the OffScreenCanvas API does
1,"Although the write up clearly explains the problem statement and also contains the changes made, it doesn't include the test plan which would give a clearer picture of the changes added."
1,"�The authors have included the different tests that they wrote, however a description of what the test is testing would be helpful."
1,"The document straight away starts with the explanation of the project specifics without any background as to what was the whole purpose of doing this. Problem statement is very general, it could have been more specific as to what was the drawbacks of the existing implementation and how that can be resolved with the new changes. The doc also lacks a test plan.� It is preferable for the doc to be written in expertiza wiki rather than the normal wiki.�"
1,"34% is better than nothing, but it's still a far-cry from a complete unit test suite for the review_response_map model. I'd recommend it be merged, but it needs to be completed."
1,There is some repetition of code but overall code quality is ok. There are some comments from the professor which should have been addressed. �
1,"There were some issues which I reported regarding comments and Notice messages displayed to User which needs to be improved. But they haven't been incorporated. It is not a blocker but definitely an important change to improve User Experience and better code readability. For example, In submitted_content controller there is a comment which says sending email to users. However it is just a method call which redirects it to delayed_mailer.rb. So this should be properly mentioned as it will be helpful for someone refactoring or understanding the code later."
1,The code is written really well. The professor frequently advised the team to improve the naming conventions as seen from the comments in the Pull Request. Suggestions: I still feel that the function�review_reminder_email�is a bit longer.�
1,No commits were found. The last commit was 15 days back.� Suggestion: I feel that there should have been some commits as the pull request shows merge issues. The Travis CI build fails and the code climate is also not able to analyse the code. There should have been commits related to resolving these things.�
1,"Team has added tests for assignment_participant model which they have changed. As the requirement was just testing one component, this is sufficient, however testing the controller would have been a more through Integration test."
1,They should have added the code as a part of the writeup instead of providing links to github commits.
1,"The write-up is clear , concise and explains the work done properly. Some screen shots would have been handy though"
1,"Write up is really good. but little short. Could have been described with more details. Also, it would have been better if they ha uploaded the screencast of the work they had done."
1,The writeup is written in a very verbose manner. They still haven't added the test plan which was missing.� Suggestion: I feel that the test plan should have been added explicitly.�
1,"Needs some work, code climate changes, a bit of DRYness and a passing CI is needed."
1,"I think User experience and code readability are as imp as producing a working code. So based on how urgent is the requirement for this functionality, I would prioritize refactoring the Notices and Display messages to more appropriately indicate what action was taken when we try to add a participant to the assignment or import using a CSV file. Secondly improving the comments as explained with an example in the first question."
1,The overall test coverage decreased by 0.6%. You could have added test cases to� response controller.rb and application helper.rb. These files have contributed the most to the decrement in test coverage. � � � �    � � �   � � �   �
1,"Build issues to be fixed. This pull request is not in ""ready to merge"" state."
1,"The Pull request shows that the code has failed all the checks. Therefore it should not be deployed.� Suggestions: Rectify the code climate, Travis Build and the merge conflict that is being displayed on the Pull request(Gemfile.lock conflict) . Once done, the code could be deployed. Functionality is working fine, no doubt but build must not be deployed unless the above issues are resoled.�"
1,The Travis CI build does not pass.� Suggestion: Team should have rectified this.�
1,"Pull request failed the tests, so that must be fixed before merging."
1,"The team has added a new test to cover the functionality. But this test is failing. There could be an issue with the notice that is generated, as during run time it is set to nil and this is checked against the string provided in the test. The overall test coverage has decreased by 0.6%."
1,"As suggested by the Mozilla team themselves, a few errors need to be rectified. The final code also needs to be formatted using rustfmt to make it consistent with the design"
1,"There can be a few changes incorporated to the code- especially the name mismatch of the web IDL and corresponding Rust file needs to be fixed. The unnecessary comments have to be removed. Moreover, the pull request shows that there are a few changes that have been requested and all checks have failed. So, the code can be merged and deployed only after these are incorporated.�"
1,I think that they need to fix some things that are mentioned by travis CI. Once they do that they are good to go.
1,The code is almost completed. Only a few final touches will make it ready to be deployed onto the production server. Maybe the future team can also work on it to achieve some more enhanced features.
1,Everything works as per the video linked in google drive. A link to the same can be added on the wiki page. �
1,"The writeup is great. I could get all the info i needed to understand the problem. Could refine the describing issues section a bit as I could see sentences like ""�Please take a look at the Github issue for suggestions on how to solve this."""
1,"The team did not have a writeup in the last submission. In this submission, they do have a writeup with the problem statement, the files modified, approach to solving the problems, and test plan. This seems to be a significant improvement from the last submission. As for the screencast links, I think one link is absent and the other one is a YouTube video of the same project submitted last year. Please check this, I think you have added the wrong link. I would also suggest that a references section needs to be added to the Wiki page so that the deployment, pull request and other project reference links are shown."
1,"It is very well written with a nice flow diagram. The second�video link on the wiki page is unavailable, which can be fixed/removed in case it is legacy."
1,The team had not added a link to the wiki during Round 1 of the review.� 'Issues to be fixed' section seems incomplete and not the right kind of writing. Please review and try to add more details on the issues that are being addressed. Otherwise the wiki looks good with relevant diagrams and code snippets.
1,"The code can be deployed once the Travis CI passes and there are some 6 minor warnings to be fixed in code climate. There are 4 failing and 1 successful checks, the team needs to make sure these checks pass in order to be able deploy the code onto the production server."
1,This code is ready to be deployed if they ensure that variables are renamed to resemble their actual functionality.� No big issues as such. Resolves the problems well.
1,Once the issues with pull request are fixed it can be merged.
1,"Unsure in this regard since they neither have the deployment neither the GitHub link to their repository, and also the coverage and the Travis CI say otherwise. Even so, in their video they show in proof that everything runs. One does wonder though, how to test without actually having the links of the repo.�"
1,"Some improvements are required before deploying it to the main server. There are changes suggested by codeclimate which need to be looked upon. The future team must ensure to pass the build. There is scope for the new tests to be written and code that would improve the overall coverage. Overall, the team has done a commendable effort with respect to the difference in the first and second submission"
1,"I believe that code, as it stands, is not ready to be deployed. More comments are needed and the code is hard to understand, so even though the changes are small, one might need to see id the changes can be simplified. I believe testing can be more thorough too.�"
1,"If they can write more test cases to test their code and make sure their code does not have bugs, i think they can deploy their code onto server.�"
1,"No. The code needs to be cleaned up before it can be deployed. The build failure needs to be fixed. Also, as the project is not deployed, manual testing could not be done."
1,The build fails and there are several issues and warnings that need to be fixed.�
1,"In the first round, which files were related to what issue was not mentioned. However, now they have edited the wiki to reflect the mentioned changes. Each file and its related functionality has been mentioned. Appreciated!"
1,There is no change in the code in this round. The variable names and method names are intuitive. The code is well indented; some useful comments can be included to improve readability. The code is DRY.
1,"The team has implemented proper functions and has used a proper naming convention. However, there is scope to add some comments. For ex: in the new method - get_feedback_assessments_for method which will return a feedback assessment, the team could have added some comments about the logic implemented. Apart from this, the code is concise and good coding and Ruby practices have been followed"
1,"Yes, the team has added test cases, the code for a couple of test cases are in the wiki in a separate section. Again, it would have been better to explain the test cases a little more, may be using screenshots of successful test cases."
1,"The code is structured well and is straightforward to follow. Test blocks are succinct and contain one assertion per block. The project has been greatly improved since the 1st round. Naming and indentation issues have been fixed. Furthermore, significant work has been done for the code to be consistent with Code Climate. One suggestion would be to elaborate on the #score method. Decomposition could be used to extract the common set up into a separate before(:each) block and test expectations using multiple 'it' statements as opposed to having everything asserted in one 'it' block."
1,Yes commits are done to fix the code climate issues.
1,"An unnecessary commit has been performed because� of which�build has failed, and i think it wasn't required as already code�had 100% coverage. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think.�Format it using rubymine and push, it should work.� A�shorter video to explain the work has been added as well.�"
1,I found many commits related to the code climate fixes.� No suggestions.
1,Works as intended. Could have elaborated a little more like a guidance in wiki.� Was able to test the features. Works fine.
1,The team has not provided steps for manual testing even though this was requested during round 1 review.
1,"The authors have added the screenshots from github which clearly shows the code change. But since there are many changes, the explanation in the wiki is small. A better way would have been to put the links to the git files where the changes are made and there could be more explanations instead. This would also reduce the size of the wiki."
1,They should have included screenshots associated with the issue. it would help one understand the solution better
1,"The write-up lacks screenshots/ relevant images/ screencast to explain the workflow of the project. This would increase the readability of the wikipage. Also, the team has added testplan and included description for the code presented in the wiki. These points were mentioned during the previous review which were picked up by the team. The team has done a good work in improving their writeup as compared to the previous version."
1,"There has been some improvement in the content of the write-up, but not all suggestions have been incorporated. Adding more screenshots of the functionality, or a video of the project being explained will always be helpful."
1,"Yes, the test does covers 99% of the models variations. The team could have enhanced tests with varied inputs, such as for the handle method check. Even a more through test of the score method with different input data could have been done.�"
1,"Although I believe this project is ready to be merged into the branch, I would still like to make sure as to why their build is failing in Travis CI. Most likely it's not because of their own code, but as a suggestion the team should have also looked into this matter themselves, and explicitly stated somewhere in the wiki by getting clarification from the instructors."
1,"I feel confident if the Travis CI integration issues are addressed, then it can be deployed in the production server."
1,"as long as they fix 3 indentation issues for code climate, they are good to go."
1,"The test is almost ready to be deployed onto the production server. As mentioned above, there are some issues need to be fixed."
1,"Build is failing, they should solve that issue, then it is ready for production."
1,The code can definitely be deployed but once the 3 pending code climate issues(I believe�the 3 are to be resolved by he mentor) and the Travis CI build have been rectified. Suggestion: Rectify the Travis CI issues.
1,"The project is ready to be merged. The source code is clearly structured�and�can be used for the future team�to work on. The project has 100% code coverage.� In order to avoid potential problems of using AssignmentParticipant instance, participantSuper object is defined in factories.rb, which is an instance of�Participant class. The possible�suggestions are�to deconstruct�#scores method and introduce 'context' constructs�to�enhance code documentation."
1,"It's a test project, so not applicable for production deployment. But the code can be�merged as appropriate test for participant model. Any future teams can enhance the test with varied input scenarios."
1,"Unfortunately, the build failed in the second round.�But, in my opinion this was not due to the team's mistake. The build failure says the two examples failed are in files ""assignment_spec.rb"" and ""assignment_participant_spec.rb"", both files which the team had no connection with. I could be wrong though. As the build was passing and there tests were running in the first round, I am inclined to believe it was because of another team's incorrect code that this team pulled into their branch by mistake."
1,"The pull request says the Travis CI build is in progress, but that seems improbable. Upon closer investigation into the Travis CI ""details"", it looks like the build is failing."
1,"It is pending while I am doing this review. When I click on it, it did not pass Travis CI, but it fails on tests on features, while this group is testing participant, it happened to our group as well, I assume it is not an issue with their code."
1,The Travis CI is in progress and there are 3 codeclimate issue to fix. �
1,"A commit has been performed 4 days back , which isn't�making any change to the code just the indentation, and since then�build hasn't passed. You should check that out, it just an indentation issue i think.�Format it using rubymine and push, it should work."
1,"The Travis CI build did not fail exactly but it did not pass either. It showed in progress. But when I clicked on the details, it showed that the test failed.� Suggestion: Travis CI issue should have been rectified."
1,The code seems to be fine but due to lack of comments a little hard to understand. It would have been better if there were some comments in get_due_date_data and addQuestionnaireTableRow.
1,"They haven't made any change since round 1 review. Haven't changed the naming as well eg�topic_id1 doesn't seem right to me. But other than 1 or 2 names, everything else looks clean. Also you haven't added comments to you code. YOu should add comments when working in a open source project."
1,"Suggested changes related to naming convention are not included in the 2nd round.� variable names : rop_topic_deadline1 , topic_id1 Puts statements are not removed : p topic_id1 � Other than this the code is properly written following coding best practices. �"
1,No new tests were added and coverage has also reduced. Some UI testing could've been done.
1,They have mentioned that its UI�change and has been discussed that testing isn't required in there documentation. But i think you should still have mentioned something there. Steps to follow to check how your changes work.�
1,"The write was good and well-written. However, it would have been better if some screenshots were also present in the writeup. May be juxtaposing the screenshots of 'before and after' of fixing the issues. That would have made the write-up easier to understand."
1,"The writeup is good and clearly explains the issues faced. However instead of putting�in the code changed, I feel it would be better to have screenshots of git commit history where we can see both the previous code and new code to get a good idea of what actually was changed."
1,The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. Also the team could have included few screen shots in the write-up. �
1,*�Test plan is missing. * Code is directly copy-pasted�in the approach section - pseudo code with proper�comments would have been better. * Wiki alignment is missing in those places where the code is copy-pasted. �
1,"some improvements are required to deployed the code onto the production server. The code should included proper commenting so that if the future team picks up from this project, they could know what exactly the code is doing."
1,It might be good to move the long function to smaller functions. But the code looks clean and understandable.
1,"the build is still failing and there are issues which needs the team's attention. there is one warning and 1 error which needs to be fixed by the issue. according to the error, team should remove the debug code from the pull request."
1,I'm essentially keeping my feedback the same. There are places where I believe that better names could be used and smaller javascript methods could be used.�
1,max_choosers name was not changed. As far as i understand it denotes the maximum number of slots and should be called max_slots. which is not changed. Apart from this code is good.
1,The team has done good manual testing but it would help to add few test in features to test the impact of the changes done in functionality of the project.
1,No new test cases were added. The new code changes don't change the modify the existing code coverage. The modifications were mostly on UI. They could have added capybara testing.
1,"The operation works perfectly from UI as shown in the youtube screencast. The App was not deployed anywhere (or the link was not posted), so couldnt test it by myself. Application could have been deployed during the second review for better understanding and trying out how the feature works."
1,"The write-up is well written. It looks like they have improved the test plan sections, but still no automated tests in the repository."
1,"Write up is good and self explanatory. Test plan helped a lot in understanding how to test it. As discussed in the earlier review, images could have been resized for better visibility. Was little difficult when one had to scroll along the page to view the entire image."
1,"The writeup is well written with proper screenshots. I liked that the team has provided appropriate screenshots for specific scenarios which covers all the aspects of the project. However, the Test-plan section could be improved by adding the test code"
1,"�I think with proper testing, this code is ready to be deployed onto the production server."
1,The code has passed the travis test and has addressed� all the issues of the Change Request. The code should be production ready after adding few more edge test case scenarios.��
1,"Overall, I think it could be deployed. There are no tests however written for this functionality, and there are some UI patterns that should be re-considered�before deploying that do not match�each other. When saving feedback, the ability to save feedback is automatically present and there is a button per row, while in the other location, you must first make a row ""editable""."
1,"The code seems to be working good from the screencast. My biggest concern was, if the link to deployment was given, it would have been easier to try the features. Other than that, capybara test cases could have made it strong to go to the production server. If they feature did work the way as it was shown in the screencast, it can be deployed to production."
1,"The team has checked most of the points given in the problem statement. However proper testing should be done before deploying this project on the main server. It must be ensured that the overall coverage increases. Other than the testing part, everything else has been implemented as expected."
1,The build has passed. The are only 2 syntactical issues due to version difference.
1,The build passes and there are only minor warnings and issues which can safely be ignored.
1,In documentation it mentions participant.rb model file is changed to for increasing code coverage. However the file is missing in the pull request generated. There is no mention about changes in the assignment_participant.rb file. But that is present in the pull request. It may be a name mismatch or some files are indeed missing. I pointed it out during the first review but changes are not incorporated currently. The code overall looks good. Proper variable names are used. Commenting is required
1,"The code consists of small methods that mostly test one thing. This results in high readability. The team has made an extensive use of 'context' constructs which further enhance the code documentation. Moreover, the team has improved the .sort_by_name method making it cleaner and easier to follow. This was�complemented by the fix of bad�names that�were present�in the first round (e.g. stu1, p1 etc.). One suggestion pertaining to the '#scores' block would be to use specific assertions of fields instead of testing the object via inspect method and comparing it to the string value."
1,"I do not see any new commit after 5th November. In my opinion, some of the tests could be made more articulate in round 2."
1,"The team has made two commits since the first review. The issues that were covered were '#scores' block and mock instance handling. However, the primary problem that�the�spec�is�testing an instance of AssignmentParticipant�class instead of Participant was not addressed."
1,"The coverage has increased from ~77% to ~94% which is impressive. However, the previous issue was that #scores method of�Participant was not called because the object�that is being tested in this project is an instance�of AssignmentParticipant class. This problem was handled by commenting out the #scores method of AssignmentParticipant so that Participant #scores method will be called instead.�This�breaks other parts of the�code which depend on AssignmentParticipant's #scores implementation. The solution to this problem is to either define a new Participant class instance in the factory or to define it in the test code itself."
1,Write up is good but the explanation of plan of work could have included some points like the approach taken.
1,"The writeup is excellent. Very carefully written, a lot of detailed explanation. Some more background information about the functions can be more helpful, as well as syntax summation."
1,"Explains the testing functionality appropriately. As mentioned in Review one, technicalities are explained thoroughly but the functional knowledge required to understand what the test is doing and why it is doing what it does is missing. Along with mentioning what are the mappings and return values, proper explanation of what the test is written for will be more appropriate in a document."
1,"The writeup is detailed, but it doesn't explain why code in the model had to be commented out very well. That was a bit alarming."
1,"The unit tests affording 95% coverage is great, but the code climate and other build problems are a bit concerning. I think this could be pulled in with more attention from the developers."
1,"If they had presented a working deployment, then rest everything was done. So it could be deployed onto the production server."
1,"The project covers a significant part of the functionality for testing the participant. However, the biggest problem is that the #scores method is commented out from the class AssignmentParticipant. Obviously this will break the existing code that relies on that functionality. Furthermore, the future testing will possibly become complicated because the object under test for participant_spec.rb is an instance of AssignmentParticipant as opposed to Participant."
1,"There were many lingering code climate issues, and the Danger bot and Travis didn't pass either. A little cleaning could be done."
1,The build did not pass Travis CI. The reason is�because #scores method is commented out from the AssignmentParticipant class.
1,"Yes, the code already followed all the good conventions earlier, except the lack of proper comments. The code still lacks comments, and the author hasn't made any changes since the last review. But the overall code quality is upto the mark."
1,"The code quality is good however, it can be improved significantly. The code lacks proper comments and contains many if else statements. They could have been refactored and avoided."
1,There are a few issues regarding code repetition and extra white space (especially in the controller rspec file).
1,yes good number of tests added coverage increased a but but i would like to see more -ve tests. Mostly +ve test cases are covered in the tests � �
1,"The writeup needs significant improvement. ""No clear explanation is given as to which files are edited for which reason. Only file names are stated along with changes made. Why the changes were made and what do those changes correct is not given."" - This review was given by me last time,and no improvement has been made in this regard."
1,"The write-up is very detailed with comparisons between previous and new versions, as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features."
1,"Documentation mentions the steps, problem statement, solutions and screenshots. The description are detailed. However, I feel there is no need to give screenshots for tests written.�"
1,"Since the Travis�test has failed, merging the code would not be a good idea. The project doesn't need to be redone from scratch, some modifications to the existing work�could make the project ready for deployment."
1,"Yes, the code seems good to deploy if we consider the manual testing and the video demonstration. But since it didn't pass Travis CI, this claims seems a bit of a concern. If we ignore the fact that lines of code was >500, and thats why Travis CI failed, but still there are a few lingering issues which the Travis CI pointed, which still hasn't been fixed. It seems more of a patch, which would require more patches to patch in the future."
1,"This code will need to be refactored, however, we will not need to build it from scratch. Only some functionality has to be divided into chunks and moved into helper functions. The functionality works well."
1,No issues codewise. Can add test cases and after thorough testing It can be deployed. Yes other team can take up and fix the minor issues and build pass.
1,"build fails that needs to be investigated , once that is done i dont see why the project cannot be merged with the mail branch. Loot of good work has been done and merge with the main branch would bring the work to fruition. �"
1,"The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. However, the Travis CI was failing and the code climate check was failing too. This is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing expertiza�code.�"
1,Travis CI did not pass. Code climate also has 121�issues to fix.
1,Travis CI build is failing. Lot of warnings and issues that have not been fixed. Many of them are trivial and easy to fix.�
1,The test cases covers the required test scenarios and the system operates as intended. The video file submitted though seems to crash. A link could have helped.
1,"The team didn't no provide the link for the deployment, but according to the video they provided, the features worked well."
1,"The write-up is very self explanatory. It successfully covers each and every aspect of the work done by the team, and also, to an extend, delvers what mindset they had while working o the project, which is very great. Just one sugestion is that, instead of simply dumping the files, they could have made a quick note of what the code in the file does. No one want to go through each and every line of code just to get an idea what it is meant to be."
1,Overall the write up was not bad. Here were some of the things I believe that could be improved: Problem Statement;Seems to be wrong. I believe it should be included in the background as it merely describes the files that they are supposed to work on.
1,"Very impressed by writeup. One suggestion: Problem statement is not mentioned thoroughly however, solution is very well ellaborated with screenshots and code snippets.�"
1,"The wiki provides enough introductions for this project. According to the wiki, I can get a clear insight about what the project is, what's the issues include in it, why the team do things as the way they said and the tests they give to make sure the functions work properly. However, the description for the first issue is not very clear and makes me confusing."
1,"The code is almost perfect, apart from the code complexity issues, which in my view isn't very tough to fix. The project need not be done from scratch, and it is certainly a good starting place for future teams to pick up."
1,The feature implementation section is good to go. However the test cases can be improved on a lot. That doesn't mean that the test cases shouldn't be deployed.
1,"The team gave fixtures for the issues exist, but to make deployment, it is better to add more tests to make sure the function work properly."
1,"The code passes for the Travis build as well as Danger Bot. However, it fails for code climate with 3 issues yet to be fixed. In totality, the pull request does satisfy the need to pass the required builds."
1,"The code is more about refactoring which is mentioned in the wiki, but I do not see any of the code�in which changes are made. Could have mentioned them in the wiki for better clarity.�"
1,"The last commit I see was 23 days ago, which seems that there wernt many changes done in the seond round. The wiki mentions the suggestions at the end, so it would have been good to have the code changes and tests for the same."
1,The team could have added more test cases as they have mentioned about refactoring the code. The refactored code and the screenshots of the test cases would have been better to display in the wiki for future students.
1,The team has added tests and the coverage improved by a small percentage. More tests can be added to further improve coverage
1,"I feel that the project could cover more test cases which would have explained the functionality better. The sql that has been mentioned, could have no results as well, so covering negative results would have been better."
1,"I found the write up to be same. There is more scope to improve it with more explanation and test cases, specially the links to the refactored codes could be added for the other teams to know."
1,"The writeup is clear and has illustrations to explain the flow. However, none of the code is added to the documentation. The project also only defines the test added but could add more details about the increase in coverage"
1,"The authors should have added screenshots for the changes made in the code. Otherwise, the purpose and work done has been explained well."
1,The writeup is good overall. But�it would have been better if more code snippets were added along with explanation of why certain methods are obsolete.
1,Yes� I think with additional testing it can be deployed.
1,I feel there are more number of test cases that need to be covered before deploying this in PROD.
1,"The code is written in a modular way but there are some errors as shown by the CI. If these are fixed, it can be merged with the main project"
1,"The code build passes the travis CI test and it has not� conflicts with the base branch. However, the team should resolve warnings."
1,"The build seems to have passed, but there are not many test cases listed to check the same. There is more scope of test cases in the same."
1,"Most of the tests passed. However, a small fraction of the tests have failed and the code needs to be modified to incorporate these changes"
1,"The code is well written. Although as suggested earlier, the team has not added comments to the code. In the wiki page, the team displays of how the code was before and after. But, I still feel this is not adequate information for a layman to be able to follow line by line what the code does. Adding comments in the code for future projects would be my best suggestion. Or, as an alternative, briefly explain in a line or 2 as to what the code does."
1,"Code written well. Remove the unwanted methods, there are few duplicate methods which can be removed."
1,"The code was well-written and no problem with long or bad names. But, no comments were present. Commenting would have made the code easier to understand. Also, refactoring was not done."
1,"The code is really well written , there are no bad names. The functions are also easy to understand. However, I would suggest them to include more comments in the code so that it becomes clear for the person reading the code that what the function and changes are all bout."
1,"Could not see any commits after the last submission as functionalities were working fine, but team could have worked upon improving test coverage."
1,"No new code was committed in the second round. I would have really appreciated it if the team could have taken the time to add comments, and fix some ""codeclimate"" issues."
1,I see really less commits in the second round. The last commit was on 31st October. It would have been really nice if they have worked on the project further to enhance the work they have done.
1,"Team has added capybara test. but team could have worked upon improving test coverage. Team can explain test description in test plan in wiki, step by step so as to understand what all test scenarios were covered."
1,The test cases added by the team pass. But overall coverage has decreased. I would suggest the team to have added more test cases for the new lines added in the controllers.
1,"Everything works from their UI. Their peer review plan works as intended and clearly explains how to test on UI. There are SQL errors when trying to delete a user which is tied to some assignment. Although the team has mentioned it is out of scope of the project, future work could be to remove those SQL error displayed on pages and give a pop up / alert box, saying your user is tied to an assignment."
1,"Writeup is written well and explained properly with good indentation, content and screenshots. Team could have explained test plan in more brief so as to understand number of test scenarios covered.�"
1,The write-up is well organized but it would have been better if some screenshots were uploaded along with the steps. That would have made the document easier to understand.
1,"The writeup is short and precise - has everything that is needed for testing and understanding and kept the writeup small for better understanding. They have mentioned about their DRY principle within ""Changes"" itself. Mentioning it as a separate sub topic will give more visibility is what I felt. Other than that everything is self explanatory."
1,"The writeup is well written. It covers almost all the work done. However, one suggestion would be to include more details about hoe the tests were done. I just one small portion dedicated to explanation of RSpec and not the work implemented."
1,No it should go through more edge cases testing
1,"Yes.From the system and code, these code changes seem ready to be deployed in production after heavy integration testing as issues seem to be working, but github pull request shows more fixes to work upon."
1,"Although as per functionality, this code is ready to be merged and the team did put in a fair amount of work into it. Still, I believe this project can be bettered by another team in the future by refactoring some the code to improve code writing principles and also improve the wiki documentation."
1,"After fixing the issues suggested by code climate, the code can be deployed."
1,The code seems ready to be deployed as the features are working as intended but it would have been better if the code was refactored.
1,"The code can be readily merged into production. 1) I felt code climate failing not an issue, because their similar blocks of code were on spec files and deleting 2 different roles is the same functionality in the end. Few places has indentation errors which can be fixed before merging. As suggested earlier, removing the error for SQL and replacing with some form of alert box could be helpful for a future work."
1,"The code is very well written as previously said. However, some test cases are still not passing and that may be troublesome if deployed onto production server. It would be a really nice opportunity for students in further classes take this up and improve the work so that they can complete the work which was left incomplete due to time constraints."
1,"The build does not pass, but only because of codeclimate issues. The code written by the team, in terms of logic is absolutely perfect. But certain conventions were not followed, such as ""proper indentation was not followed"", ""DRY principle violated"". Although these have no impact on the functionality, these coding practices are industry convention and maybe the team would want to consider giving them equal importance for the next projects."
1,Build is not passed. Build failed Travis CI. Team can work�to fix suggestion given on the pull request.�
1,"The build passed in Travis CI and there were no conflicts. But, some issues are not fixed like refactoring is not done and block has too many lines. These issues should be considered for a well written code."
1,A better explanation on the test cases would have made sure that the code is ready. I feel that some more tests need to be done before deploying the code.
1,"The code is functionally ready to be deployed in the production server, because it is sound and even passes the build of Travis CI. There are a few minor issues due to Cognitive Complexity of names of methods, lines of code and a few indentation errors. If they are fixed, the code is complete and will pass the build of codeclimate as well. The team has proceeded in the correct approach and there is no need for the project to be redone from scratch using a different approach."
1,"From the file diff in GitHub, it looks the code is in good shape. There were a few suggestions provided during round 1 review. If those could also be integrated, it would be better. The test cases are successfully running. But the functionality could not be tested due to lack for steps in the wiki.�"
1,"The build seems to pass, but it would have been great if the test cases were explained better. Maybe some screenshots or a video would have been easier to test."
1,Code is very neat and readable. I appreciate you attention to following good syntax practices. There is some similar code was exists in the controller action method and the content page method but simple to bring out and make dry. Overall great job.
1,The travis test had failed and codeclimate shows indentation and other such minor errors. I think that the team just needs to work on the styling and following some Ruby guidelines and they are good to go.
1,"There is a minor code climate error as mentioned above, similar code. An easy fix and you will be green with the climate check."
1,Overall the code looks good with most of the coding standards being followed. However I think it lacks proper commenting and also there were few stray�pieces of commented out code lying around. Adding few more comments and deleting unused code would be better.
1,There were not any bad naming in round 1 as well. Comments could have been added for new additions which is still missing. There has been no DRY issues
1,"Yes the write up is good, if they were able to host it'd have been better for checking the work.�"
1,"It can be deployed but first, it should be tested thoroughly.�"
1,"As It did not pass the test, it is not ready. For a future team, end of this project should be a good starting place."
1,"I believe this change that affects the system as a whole, needs more test to be performed in all affected tables and functions to be sure, no other part of the system is broken.My opinion is that, once all parts of the system test is done, corresponding to this centralized db change the code can be deployed to production."
1,Few minor issues with the build which can be ignored.
1,"The build has successfully passed the Travis CI test and there are no merge conflicts present in the pull request. However, there were a few code climate issues which I think can be easily fixed."
1,"There were only 2 commits made during the second round. However, the team had mostly implemented most of the functionality during the first round, maybe due to which there are less commits in the second round"
1,The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand. Also the screenshots could be a little better.
1,"The code has mast elements ready but there can be more test cases generated with better test coverage. The code need not be rewritten from scratch, it just needs to include some more of the expected�functionality"
1,There�is only 1 error and warning which can be rectified and fixed and then can be deployed. No need to be redone from scratch. Future team can fix it and merge to main branch.
1,"There must be some test cases that should have been covered according to Travis CI. Also the build has failed. However, the team claims that some of the tests are running locally. If some of these points are looked upon, the code would be ready to be deployed on the main server."
1,the code looks fine. The only concern is related to the CI build which is failing at the moment. Some of the tests are failing because of the change.�
1,No build did not pass. 1/3 checks very successful. It is fixable and the issues are trivial.
1,The build in Travis CI failed. 3 out of the 4 build jobs had passed. The build job failed in the features folder. The branch did not have any conflicts with the main branch
1,"The code is well written according to the video. Since there's no github submission, I went to the sumitter in the pull request to check his work. It seems that the code is relatively good. There's some minor indentation and alignment issue. And not much explaining comments. But other than that, no bad name, no long function."
1,"The code is difficult to understand. There are cases where factories are used and then later replaced by mocks in the individual test cases. The code also does not appear to be DRY, as several of the mocks appear redundant in the context of the plethora of factories built.�"
1,"For each method, there should be multiple test cases, but they put all tests for a method together wrap by a single it '.....' do, they should consider to add more it '......' do, to separate each test case, so the reader know what are they testing."
1,"Yes, the team made commits� days ago, but then it seems that they didn't follow-up with the feedback they received on the pull request, as their were 7 issues, though of minor severity, which required fixing, and then there were no commits after that."
1,"There's no upload for the local folder. It seems that no new pull requests has been committed during the 2nd round, so I would guess no new code being committed for the 2nd round."
1,"The team did not attach the link for the github repo along with the other files submitted. This makes it difficult to comment upon the commits made. However, from the video link it can be seen that the test cases have improved to give a full path coverage."
1,"Yes, the team covered 100% of the code they had to test. Also, the video given in the link was very informative and helped to understand the implications of the work done by the team to a far greater extent."
1,"FRom the Pull request i see Coverage Decreased, But from the Screen-cast looks like 100% covered When i tried running manually i get the below errors �1) ReviewResponseMap #final_versions_from_reviewer���� Failure/Error: prepare_final_review_versions(assignment, maps)���� ���� NoMethodError:������ undefined method `prepare_final_review_versions' for #<Class:0x007fab83429010>"
1,"The team did not add any test cases since they had achieved a 100% coverage in the first round itself. However, certain changes made to the test cases included using proper naming conventions for attributes and following the DRY principle effectively throughout the model file."
1,The write up has some great information and snip its of code. It would have been a great addition to have included more discussion on the overall design of your test cases. Overall a nice wiki.
1,"This is where the project lacks the mos. The write-up isn't very informative, specially for an outsider. It states the points very shortly, without going into much depth. Also, the writeup bombards the user with lots of un-relevant information and pieces of code, which make it feel very long, although lacking significant content. The writeup could have been more detailed, and could have omitted the unnecessary parts, like dumping of code, and not explaining what it does.�"
1,"The writeup is a bunch of codes, there's not enough explanation.� The ""allow"" function is important for the mock functions. But it is explained in no place."
1,"The write-up is difficult to follow, and doesn't provide much insight into how the testing code works. Despite having a test plan section, no test plan is included."
1,"The team has worked on improving the wiki document. The writeup now includes the Test plan section� that was suggested in the first round specifying the how the team setup an expertiza environment, the model functions used and the mock instance built for testing the model file.�"
1,"Yes, apart from the 7 issues of minor severity from codeclimate, the code is perfectly well to integrate with the project. No, the project need not be planned and executed from scratch, it is implemented well enough."
1,The code is good because it covers the scenarios. But one thing that prevents the 5-star is that they do not have enough� commenting and seems to be not that detailed and careful in terms of the explanation.
1,"It is very difficult to recommend merging this code. Although it builds and appears to function correctly, it is not properly documented. It is difficult to tell how the code works and whether test cases introduced actually function as they intend."
1,It can be merged after fixing the code climate which has 7 issues(needs to follow the coding standards )and need to work upon the overall decreased code coverage.
1,"Yes, the code did pass Travis CI successfully, but as mentioned earlier, the code did fail on 7 grounds, of low severity. This should have been fixed by the team, as the issues were very small, and required just minimal follow-up."
1,Great job with your pull request and passing the Travis CI build. There are several code climate failures that could have been addressed many to deal with incorrect formatting and extra parenthesis or braces. Simple fixes so great job!

1,Travis build failing at�./spec/models/menu_spec.rb:120
1,Travis CI build indicates that the tests have failed. The code climate issues in the Danger Bot also did not pass. The team must look towards cleaning up the code. �
1,"The code is written very well. There's some minor issues (sometimes there's duplicate ""allow""s. But actually in the same ""describe""� just one ""allow is enough. On the other hand, there's no bad name, no hard-to-understand functions. Comments can be added just a little bit more to help people understand. Some comments are not supposed to be there (such as discarded codes)"
1,The travis CI test did not pass. Suggestion: Rectify the Travis CI issue.
1,The source code is mostly written in a coherent way and is straightforward to follow.� The 'context' blocks are extensively used which increases the project documentation. The commented chunks of code blocks that were present in the 1st round are mostly removed. There are still a few instances left and I would suggest to remove them because they reduce the overall readability. I would also suggest�to decompose�the 'it' block inside the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' by moving the common setup to a before(:each) block and spreading the assertions across several 'it' statements.� Another improvement would be to remove the 'xit' code blocks because they only increase the clutter and do not add any value to the code. Adding one comment explaining why the blocks are no longer necessary would do the job.
1,"Yes, if must be, they must need more test cases ot cover some edge cases."
1,"The number of commits that are made after the 1st round is impressive. The team has made a significant progress during the 2nd round, however I would suggest using more descriptive names for the commits so that it becomes easier for the reader to refer to them in the future."
1,The command to run the test cases is given in the wiki. Better thing would have been to provide the screenshots of the test cases and git links to the code to make the wiki more concise and well explained.
1,The test coverage on the diff in this pull request is�100.0%�(50%�is the threshold). This pull request will bring the total coverage in the repository to�28.7%�(-19.0%�change). ---- seems like the coverage was reduced. Need to add some test cases to increase the coverage. The above reason is why I have given 4. But I would definitely consider this as well ----�  Overall coverage increased (+11.0%) to�47.72%
1,"The team has created test cases for unit testing the model file menu.rb. The test cases are meaningful and are getting passed. Once the Capybara error quoted in the 3rd rubric gets fixed, the current code can be merged into the repository. Since the team's project is unit testing and does not concern modification or augmentation of any feature, there is no question of deployment to production server."
1,"The team has improved the writeup since the 1st round. The 1st round version consisted of the copied code from review_response_map.rb and review_response_map_spec.rb files. This version clearly defines each test case and in some instances elaborates on the inner workings of the blocks for example "".import"" Method discussion. However, design principles and patterns that were used in this project are still missing from the writeup.� One thing that stands out in the code is that every mock object is defined at the start of the file. The team could provide a rationale for this decision and why it is superior to for example using different mocks for each separate test suite."
1,�I believe this code is ready to be merged once the Travis CI passed.
1,Once travis build passes the project could be merged. I have seen specs in the existing code base that are very implementation dependent so this won't be an issue.
1,"The team has worked on achieving the path coverage by taking the edge cases into consideration. But, as most of the builds have failed, it may need a working deployment for it to being deployed on the server."
1,The build can be definitely deployed once the Travis CI issue has been fixed. Suggestion- Rectify the Travis CI issue.
1,"The Wiki should not include Conclusion and learning outcomes part, it is not a report of the project, but a page to show what the project itself is."
1,"The write-up is good, but it doesn't feel much refined or improvised after the initial edit. As mentioned above, the image isn't visible clearly, which means that it wasn't reviewed much after posting. But apart frm that, the flow of the write-up is very effective, in fact one of the best that I've reviewed. The concept of giving a higher lvel view, and then diving deeper into the implementation is very subtly applied."
1,"The write up starts with introduction about Expertiza, Test Driven Development and Unit Testing. It then moves over to describing the problem statement, team members, test plan and implementation that contains detailed documentation on the procedure to set up the Expertiza environment, functionalities of Menu model, sample views , declaration of mock objects as test entries and finally the conditions tested on each of the method of the Node and Menu class. The various methods tested on the Node class include initialize, setup, site_controller, controller_action, content_page and add_child. Similarly the methods tested on the Menu class include initialize, select, get_item, get_menu, selected, selected? and crumbs.� The write up also includes the screenshot of the Rspec tests that were run. The screenshot of the SimpleCov coverage report is blurred and not readable.� The write up ends with concluding remarks, learning outcomes and References. Overall, the documentation was very precise and clear with all the information needed to understand the code on Github. The authors could have included and highlighted how to run the Rspec code since their project specifically deals with unit testing. Another apparent issue that I can point out is the quality of screenshot."
1,"�The writeup�overall is good, but they did change the problem related to test plan like I mentioned last time."
1,"Most of them are good, but some edge cases should be considered."
1,"The given source code is ready for deployment.�The object under test is fully covered and all of the test cases are�implemented�correctly. The build successfully passes Travis CI. The future team will have no problems in picking up from�here. However, there is a room for further improvement when it comes to simplifying several test cases, especially the '.final_versions_from_reviewer' block. Moreover, 'xit' blocks need to be removed because the final version should not contain any tests that are in the pending state."
1,The function process seems to be a bit long. It could have been splitted based on oscillator types rather than having all of them in the same function. Apart from that rest of the code seems great.
1,"The team has completed the missing code in the file oscillator_node.rs which generates different wave forms like sine, square, sawtooth and triangle. They then created the file oscillator.rs that generates�objects and calls methods to run the different oscillator type examples. The code in both these Rust files have good comments that clearly explain what every snippet does and the significance of variables. This made it easy to follow the syntax and semantics of a new programming language like Rust (Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on memory safety and concurrency). The variable names used are intuitive and the code is well indented.  One issue that I can point out here is that the code is lengthy and complex with a lot of redundancy; especially those that define the audio context, destination node, oscillator and a few other local variables in the file oscillator.rs are repeated for every oscillator waveform and can certainly be encapsulated in one function that can be called only once in the file.�"
1,"The team's test plan includes running the oscillator binary file using the command ./oscillator. This will run the oscillator.rs where various oscillator nodes corresponding to sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms are generated. Hence, the user will be able to listen to these waves after a definite interval."
1,"The writeup starts off by introducing Servo- Mozilla's experimental high performance browser engine and Rust- which is a systems programming language with memory safety and concurrency used to build Servo. It then moves over to Web Audio API for handling audio operations inside audio context and allow modular routing, and a workflow for implementing Web Audio was clearly listed. It then flows into the scope of the project and the implementation. The graphical and mathematical representation of the sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveform gave a solid conceptual foundation. The code snippet of the changes done in oscillator_node.rs and the new file oscillator.rs (created by the team) has also been included. The section Build that explains the procedure to install dependencies (Rust), step by step procedure for building and running the build was very useful to explore the project. The team had included the build instructions for Windows and Debian-based Linux. They could have augmented the build instructions for Mac OS X, which might save Mac Users from reading verbose instructions on the official documentation and instead refer to a single source (the wiki). The authors end the wiki by providing the test plan with examples of generated sine, square, sawtooth and triangle waveforms as audio files; pull request and references."
1,"I believe this code is ready to be deployed, and if it isn't, it can definitely be picked up in the future."
1,modify some to make it drier.
1,"The code is almost perfect except for the lack of proper commenting. The author has not improved or updated the ocde since the last review, as the last commit was about 11 days back."
1,"Review 1 comments weren't addressed. Better name could have been used than ca_testx. Also scenarios test the code and not the behavior- instead of- ""when x happens, this method does this"" we have - ""x happens so y contains this"". This isn't maintainable as changes to implementation will break/stale out these tests."
1,Overall well written code. Use of factory bot reduces code redundancy in building test cases. The team could have reduced the code redundancy inthe menu method test example.
1,"The topic assigned to this team is Unit testing on menu.rb. So, they had to create Rspec tests for the methods in the model file menu.rb in the new file spec/models/menu_spec.rb. The team has precisely tested the functionalities of every method including all relevant scenarios (as contexts) of both the nested class Node and the enclosing class Menu. The names used for mock objects and literals are intuitive and follow the Ruby's convention. There were a few issues regarding incorrect indentation and the verbosity of the spec code in the previous round. The team has rectified those in this round. In my view, giving additional comments for code in rspec is superfluous as the tests are already embedded with information on what it intends to do through the use of 'describe', 'context' and 'it' methods.� The code is DRY through the use of reusable mock objects like menu, nodes, site controllers, content pages, controller actions, items and roles which span across the entire block where it is defined. Additionally, the use of before(:each) method to initialize and set up these objects further DRY's up the spec for the methods.�"
1,A few comments could be included in code to make it more clear.
1,"The writeup has� covered nearly everything we need. all the function details are in the writeup, as welll as each function. However, I think there's too much code and not enough textual explanation."
1,"The code has been written as per the coding standard. The code written by the team adheres to dry principle. However, as per my first review comments it is advisable to follow better naming conventions. The team could rename their function names such as the below one to something smaller such as get_time_diff. The code needs refactoring in names and addition of comments.�  def get_time_diff_btw_due_date_and_now(due_date)"
1,The team has added 2 test cases in the�sidekiq_mail_worker_spec. More test cases could be added to fully test the functionality.�
1,"The code implementation is correct , so with more edge test cases and after resolving the warnings in the travis test, the code would be production ready."
1,The git link to the code repository is not provided.
1,"The code was well written and looks dry. However, a few comments could be added to make the code more understandable.�"
1,"Code looks okay, changes suggested have not been implemented. I wanted to see more comments on ""why"" this is has been done, which is missing.� Also strings checks for str != '' are still used and not .empty �"
1,"Yes the team did add test cases but I am surprised on why the coverage numbers have fallen so much. This needs some investigation.� I think good test cases were added as part of the work, i would have though liked to see more -ve test cases checking for the failure conditions�"
1,"Was unable to test the work from UI , but the implementation looks okay. I would have liked some screen hots of mails and videos to be uploaded as references so that reviewers could look at them as well.� �"
1,"The team added the test plan section but it was too short and did not explain all the test files created and/or modified. The implementation section could do without the many code dumps. Otherwise, the writeup was concise and effective."
1,1) The write-up is comprehensive and clearly explained. 2) Should explain the test cases in more detail.
1,"The write-up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features."
1,Writeup is decent. I felt that code should have been quoted rather than included pictures of as that would make it easier to modify. The pngs weren't same size which appears to be negative that people� have commented on my work too.
1,"Write up is Okay, The test plan comes before solution / approach section . pls change the ordering. there is no reference section� instead of putting screen shots of code it would be better if the authors had put code snippets �"
1,A few changes to functions and their declaration have to be made to make the code production ready
1,No the build failure needs to be investigated. Some refactoring regarding the messaging should be done. instead of hard coding the mail it should be read from a config file.�
1,"The code is visually stunning. I am a great fan of the readibility. There are some instances of redundancy in the #controller_action / #site controller tests. Also in the #get_item/#get_menu. Would be easy to pull those out into a begin block. Otherwise, very lovely."
1,"Currently your team have�4 code climate issues that denote code redundancy as stated in the code comment above. Best just to bring those statements out to keep it as dry as possible.�From what I can tell, none of the pull requests pass these requirements including my own teams so I am not sure what is the cause of this but I guess no one will be getting all the stars on this questions :)"
1,The write up is good overall. I believe there could be more explanation or discussion into test cases not included in the design but otherwise a good wiki.
1,"The test plan should have come before the implementation details. I gave this suggestion in my previous review as well. Still, the documentation is well written overall. It's just a puzzling choice to put the test plan near the end."
1,"I had suggested changing the ambiguous or bad variable like temp, temp1. These changes have been incorporated. However comments missing. Adding these will improve the readability of the code and make it easy to refactor at a later stage as per requirements"
1,"The wirteup is pretty good. It gives the test plan and all the test cases. Also, there is explanation of the test process and logic. Just one minor problem.� The 29 tests provide 100% coverage of the lines in menu.rb. Before the project the coverage was only It is an incomplete sentence."
1,"The introduction to the scope of the project has been written neatly, but I feel the test plan should�have been a little more elaborative, a short description of the tests would be nice to have."
1,"While the test coverage has increased to 100%, the team has made some changes to ""schema.rb"" file, this might cause a problem on other dependent modules. Hence, I feel it is risky to deploy it on production. The project doesn't�need to be started from scratch by the next team.�"
1,"As its a test project, deployment to production may not be applicable. The code can be merged, but i would suggest few changes to DRY the code as the test seems slow, which is a scope for improvement."
1,"The code written is following the Ruby on rails guidelines. The variables, methods, and class names do seem to follow proper convention and are suggestive of the functionality they are being used for. In some cases they could have used a little more descriptive names for variables for example inside app/helpers/student_task_helper.rb� they could have used background_colour instead of rtn as a variable name in the due_date_color() method. It will become more readable for the reviewers to understand the functionalities. Also they have added to few commits for the amount of code change that they have done. The commit messages� are not descriptive enough about what changes have the authors committed."
1,"Code Snippet added.� Still, Git link is not of the pull request.�� No link provided for the change. Either screencast or the URL of the deployed application would have been ideal."
1,"Code is written very well, comments are detailed and functions and variables are named appropriately. (would just like to point out, in student_task_helper.rb#due_date_color , the variable ""rtn"" could've been named better!)"
1,New code added is written well with DRY and no long or complicated functions. I could see file updated has changes on line such as tab and space. Team could work upon indentation.�
1,"There have been only two commits - one on 30th Oct and second on 31st October. There have been no commits since. It would have been better if you people had given one more commit resolving the issues given by code climate, since most of them are trivial.�"
1,No new commit has been added since the last submission. The commit messages are not descriptive. They should commit small portions of code one by one with proper description of the changes in the commit� message. Also their functions seem to be very long. they may consider refactoring and creating more cohesive code. Each function should do only one task.
1,"It is given in wiki that most of your test cases depend on checking the output. However, like I mentioned in my last review, several test cases like the ones mentioned below can be automated. This is especially true as TDD is explicitly mentioned in your problem statement: ""Write the required tests before implementing/refactoring the methods in the above-mentioned classes"".  Add past due assignments to the student�s task list (on Student View). Check for correction in due dates of assignments (when an assignment�s due date is edited, it should be appropriately moved from the �Past assignments� list to the �Current Assignments� list if needed) On Student Task page, separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box."
1,the team has implemented there testing plan and have been very thorough with there test cases. They seem to have considered a lot of cases and have implemented them in rspec. The only thing that they should do is use different commits for adding test cases.
1,Test Plan could be described better.
1,Team could have added test plan in wiki along with test covered and test description. Also could have worked upon increasing test coverage.
1,The operations work as intended but need to have automated test cases.
1,"Yes, it works as intended. It would be better if you could add a video recording of the flow/screenshots of the flow in the test plan.�"
1,The bug fixing does work according to the screenshots provided by the authors. They have provided a step by step screenshot of the issue that they have fixed. The authors haven't hosted their version of the expertiza so it is very difficult to actually check the functionality. They could have hosted expertiza on VCL or they could have put a screen cast of the working functionality to help in reviewing.
1,Detailed. But the screenshots of the manual testing are missing in the test plan.
1,"The write-up is very detailed as to what features have been implemented but lacks on explaining how they are implemented. It can be improved by adding how the features have been implemented, why they chose this logic to implement the features and how to test the code or show how they have tested the code."
1,The wiki documentation has been updated. All the information has been documented in a neat and logical manner. The write up adequately provides what functionality the work is related to. They havent updated any part of the wiki documentation but overall their documentation is concise and to the point.
1,"- The write-up does mention the files changed but misses out on adding code snippets. - Little formatting inconsistencies found like ""-- Expertiza Project"" in the introduction, and a "":-"" only for Overview but none of the other headings. - Looks like ""Separate the list of 'teamed with' students from the current tasks box"" needs to be a heading rather than plain text! -�Now we have created a separate table for assignments"" sounds ambiguous - does it mean a new database table or a html table..? Please be specific. - ""A helper function was also added to format a string into multiple lines"" - please mention what the string is about (what it represents), what are these multiple lines that it is getting split into, and why you would want to split them. - Test Cases are not stated. Test Plan does mention one as ""for example"" but the testing process could've been given a little more respect. :)"
1,I think the code need some amount of refactoring before it can be merged with the expertiza master and pushed to production. Some of the functions implemented by the team seem quite long and they should try and restrict the functionality implemented in each function to just one.
1,"The code seems very well written and approach seems correct. If they improve the documentation and add test cases after thorough testing, it should be good to be deployed. As it stands, another team in future can pickup the code and implement these improvements."
1,"The view file contain 200 more files so it is quite difficult to figure out the�structure of the View. It is better if independent component is introduced to construct the whole task view. And the commits contain the Gemfile, which is considered not secure to deploy for it alters the production environment.�"
1,"The code is written aptly and it does what it is supposed to do. However, code comments are missing."
1,"The code was well written and there was no issue with the naming or functions used. However, a few comments could be added to the current_team,new_team and team to make the code more readable."
1,All coding principles are followed. //Add more comments.
1,The write up has most of the relevant information. The formatting could have been better. I would suggest the team to use a standard dimension for the screenshots they have added.
1,I did not understand why is it necessary to prohibit spaces in usernames. I believe the code could have been modified to work with spaces as well
1,Comments in the code would have been helpful to understand the flow.
1,The code was already well-written . The team did a great work in following coding best practices. The team should have include code comments to make the code easier to understand.
1,No additional commits were found considering one issue was still left to be implemented. Suggestion: There should have been�some�commits present pertaining to test cases or at least the 3rd issue that was not implemented.
1,The team did not add any test cases.� The coverage did not increase as a result of that.� Suggestion: Unit test cases should have been written as a part of the final deliverable.
1,"The project was not deployed. The project should have been deployed. However, the video that the team uploaded shows the 2 functionalities that they have implemented. And they work as intended. Suggestion: One feature was not implemented (3rd issue) and should have been done as a part of the deliverable. And the project should have been deployed."
1,It looks decent. The screenshots should be with the issue write up and not at the end
1,Write up is written well and it is understandable. Images are not in proportion and not of same size and hence wiki page does not look steady. Team can work on image size and image description and manual test plan in more detail.
1,The content is good and explanatory but the writing styles needs to be improved as there is inconsistency in the font size and font type.
1,"The writeup was well written and easy to understand. However, it would have been better if some steps accompanied the screenshots as to what was happening in each screenshot. That would have made the writeup even easier to understand."
1,The write-up is well written and organised. Everything looks fine. The team should have mentioned about the approach taken to solve the mentioned problem statement which will make the implementation easier to understand.� �
1,Two issues resolved seem like working pretty well and can be deployed in production. Third unresolved issue is a good start for future team to pick up.
1,"I think that the team has done a great work for the future team to pick up. They can improve it by adding comments for newly defined functions. Although, the pull request build has not passed, after fixing the conflicts, the new team can readily work ahead on the remaining issues."
1,"I do not think the code should be deployed. The test cases are not yet written and there are a few code climate issues. Due to the lack of test cases, the Travis CI build has also failed.� Suggestion: Once they are resolved the code can be deployed. There is one remaining issue, but that could be done in the next iteration.�"
1,The CI build was failing in the previous submission as well in the new submission. The team should have corrected the same. �
1,The Travis CI test did not past.� I did not find any test cases written. Suggestion: Test cases should have been written as a part of the final deliverable.
1,The overall structure of the code looks good and all the coding standards have been followed. I feel like there could have been more comments to support the large amounts of changes that have been made.
1,"Most of the updated code is well written. Some functions could have been shortened. For example, in the set_display_type function, instead of writing a 'when' statement for each of the options, you could have stored them in a hashmap and set display type to that value if it exists in the hashmap."
1,The code is well written. It follows DRY principle. It would have been better if more comments were added.
1,The team has made sure to write the relevant test cases wherever possible. But the overall coverage has decreased. In my opinion the newly added test cases cover�more or less the entire range of this project. But I think that they need to focus a bit more on the test casses.
1,"The team has added screenshots on the submission page, which show that the UI is working as intended.� However, it had been more clear had they made a screencast of the same."
1,The authors have portrayed their work by adding many code snippets. It is cumbersome to go through the entire code in the write-up. A general approach towards refactoring principles used would have been impressive.
1,"The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts so far which is commendable. However, the Travis CI was failing and the code climate check was failing too. This is something that the team must look into and make sure that the changes that they have made are consistent with the existing expertiza�code."
1,"The pull request still shows that the build fails. On observing the logs, there is only one build job which fails due to a ActionNotFound error for view_action method. This needs to be looked at."
1,Even though the code has been refactored keeping in mind the coding standards but I think that there is still room for improvement in writing the test cases and the PR checks should be checked as well since they are failing. This is something that the next team could pickup and then the code could be ready to be deployed on the production server.
1,"The overall code quality is moderate. I would suggest the team to either use hexadecimal color codes or names, to ensure that the code remains consistent."
1,"It was a simple UI color change, so not many categories are not applicable. the code can be DRY, by using the CSS file for styles. Also there is no need to add colors in bothand .  would suffice"
1,No commit has been added since round 1. They should have fixed the build failure which is probably happening because they have pushed changes few extra changes in schema.rb which I don't think is required for this project.
1,"Unfortunately, no tests were added. It would have been good if the team added test cases to check their UI changes."
1,A huge improvement from Round 1. In round one not much code was submitted so this is a huge improvement. Keep it up. I have a Suggestion: It is very important to have comments in the code which will help other readers understand your code or in this case understand what you have tested without having to look for any other documentation which explains it. (Code file should be self sufficient)
1,"The structure of codes is not very good, that is, for a ""it"" statement, there are two many things include in it to be tested. It is better to separate �the test cases clearly. Besides, the objects seem not store in factories properly."
1,The team has heeded to the advice given in the last round and explained their tests in a more detailed manner. I do feel that the write up is well written and covers almost all the important points of the project. But I do feel images showing their tests running successfully could be added to the results part of the writeup.
1,"The description for the background, motivation and the deign is not very clear. The team can give more detailed introduction specific to this project."
1,"I do believe the code could be deployed after a bit of refactoring is done as suggested by the code climate tests. But overall looking at only the functionality of the code, it is ready to be deployed"
1,"It is a testing project which aims at improving test coverage. So production deployment is not in question. However before merging the code to Master branch here are a few recommended changes. 1) Adding comments to improve readability and understanding for future use. 2) Avoid using comments like ""I swear this is the last one"". They do not explain anything about what you changed from your last commit and why. Proper professional comments are expected. All these comments should be refactored."
1,The code has been merged in a good way and there have been no merge conflicts. The build did pass the Travis CI. The code climate test failed but those were small issues which can easily fixed by just revisiting the code.
1,"The team has provided an excellent write-up with proper explanation of the problem statement and the solutions they have provided. The team has also included� a video which make things really easy to understand. The team has shown navigation structure of the expertiza menu, which makes the workflow clear."
1,The write-up was nicely written in the first round itself. It gives a clear idea of the project.
1,"Yes, the changes work as expected in the UI. The test cases cover most of the scenarios. Would have been good if there was some scope for negative test cases that could be explained."
1,"The write up is short and to the point, it could have been formatted and arranged in a better way."
1,The write up was well explained. Test cases were with images of test cases in the UI. The code could have a github screenshot or the link to the changed file for more clarity.
1,"The code looks to be ready to be deployed on production, but would appreciate to have a few more tests run prior to it."
1,"No. This is not standards to add colors in the respective element. It becomes very hard to maintain or modify such changes in future. It would be better to move the style to a scss file and use a class-UI to make this change, which is clean and DRY"
1,Build is failing probably because they have pushed changes few extra changes in schema.rb which I don't think is required for this project.
1,"I am honestly unsure how to rate this. Earlier the build was passing. Now Travis CI cumulatively says the build failed, but when you look at the build history, Job#6150.3 failed, but Job#6150.4 passed."
1,"No. I see there are some code was commented, which seems unnecessary, so just delete it."
1,"In the wiki, I really appreciated seeing the appropriate build statements next to the unit tests. It helped connect what each test was testing in my mind."
1,"Yes good write up but would have like to see details on model.� In test plan lines like ""�two test cases for method "" are redundant. Can / should remove them�"
1,"Most are good, but the Test cases part just a combine of ""describe"" and ""it"" part of spec code. Could be replaced by a link of git."
1,"the team has made great improvement as compared to the last submission. The new code added has no bad names, long or complicated functions but there is lack of comments. the heading of the write-up pages explains what the test case is doing but there should be proper commenting done in the code too."
1,"Write-up includes everything the team has implemented. It clearly show the files which were involved to complete the project, background of the project and evrything. overall work done by the team is good but I feel that the test plan on the write-up page should be edited. The team should work on presenting their work to everyone in a good way."
1,The code has been very well written and it follows all the coding practices. There could have been few more comments but other than that I don't see any other problem.
1,"Overall, the code is very well-written and follows all the best coding practices. But what I feel is a few more comments could help in improving the readability of the code. Also, there were few console debug statements which were causing the code-climate checks to fails. These could be removed or logged into Rails log."
1,"The code changes are very less, so not much to say about refactoring, DRY problems etc. The code has ""put"" statements which are also pointed out by the code climate bot.Having put conditions is not a good coding style, the authors could have considered to remove the statements. puts ""hi, im in import""  puts name.to_s The authors could have debugged to see the flow of code, or remove them before committing."
1,"Their writeup is still the same doc file they had uploaded in the first submission. Now, while it was a good progress in resolving some of their errors in their first submission, clearly it is insufficient to be considered adequate for the second submission seeing as no changes have been made to it.�"
1,The write-up is very well written and documented. It is aided well with the the help of screenshots and proper labelling. The only small thing that I would like to suggest is the steps to reproduce or something similar so that the person not familiar with the expertiza�can also reach to the desired place.
1,"Writeup clearly explains what their use cases are and what solution they came up with. There is a lack of background about it, how to test it from UI, test plan, test cases, DRY principle etc. Their write up is not on wiki, which makes it difficult to download the file every time and check it. Although it was pointed out during the first round, the team didn't change it , or they didn't update the wiki page which they created."
1,Again wiki page is missing. They submitted a google doc for the same
1,"While the functionality is present, there are several debug statements in the code that need to be removed and tests need to be added."
1,Not ready to be deployed. Some changes needed along with addition of tests
1,"These fixes appear to be acceptable. Code Climate could be better, and debug code could be removed, but if the changes in the document are in the source, than I have no complaints."
1,"No, this code is not ready to be deployed since it fails in basic builds and just passes 5 out of 13 test cases which calls for reasonable concerns and traceback in the motivation of the teams approach. However, it does prove to be a good starting point for a future team to pick from where these people have left off.�"
1,I think the project looks pretty close to be merge-ready and with a small amount of work on the coding styles and making sure all the PR checks pass the code can be deployed on the production server. It might however require some rigorous�testing before getting merged.
1,"The code does its functionality, but it's not tested.� My biggest concern would be to have the test cases written for it before the production version.� It is a good starting place for a future team to pick up and just cover the test cases."
1,"Nope, they have errors in their build too as indicated by Travis CI and this is the error message output by it ""�Hey�@ppvasude, Something went wrong with the build. TravisCI finished with status�errored, which means the build failed because of something unrelated to the tests, such as a problem with a dependency or the build process itself."" On checking the build logs I found that they errors in Bundle Install stage itself resulting from missing gems which they haven't resolved as a part of second submission.� �"
1,"Yeah, the build has passed the Travis CI test and there were no conflicts found on the pull request."
1,The Travis CI has passed.
1,Writeup is still in the form of a word doc instead of a wiki. Test Plan and Tests are missing.
1,The system works as intended however the flow for system given in the wiki is quite confusing. The test cases were edited to cover all scenarios.
1,Everything is working
1,"Yes, the� code seems well written and there was no issue with the naming or functions used. However, a few comments could be added to impersonating_as_admin."
1,"Yes, the code is written really well."
1,"The team has included a thorough testing plan but I couldn't find any commits to any of the rspec testing controllers. They could have added as per there test plan. These tests could have been included 1) Login as Instructor4. Add a new assignment Assignment_Instructor4 under the course Course 617, Spring 2016. 2) Make student6400 as the participant of that assignment and logout. using Capybara and Cucumber."
1,"No, there have been no new additions to the test cases since last round of review. The code coverage still remains the same as before, with an increase of 6.6%."
1,The write-up was good and clearly explains the issues faced and the code changed. It would have been much more clear if screenshots of git file changed were posted.�
1,"The code is well written. The dummies created are given proper and relevant names. However, I can not see much comments. I would suggest that inclusion of more comments would have enhanced the readability and efficiency of the project.�"
1,"The Wiki is great, but I believe it's better to move the Testing framework part to front of the page."
1,"One test case failing on travis. Once that is fixed, code can be merged."
1,"The pull request was not updated. (In fact, I can't see any of the changes in the linked repo.)"
1,"Nope, the last commit still shows from 12 days ago which is the time period even before the first submission. Overall, the branch is 3 commits ahead and 20 commits behind the Expertiza master. Even so, conclusively going by their git hub their last commit was before the first submission and hence, no commits in the second submission."
1,No new commits after the first submission.
1,Yes the code has been well written and very ruby like. The usage of existing gems is good. Functions have were good. I did not find many issues with the first review. So authors have kept it the same. very well done. �I wanted few more comment in code but thats okay.�
1,"Test coverage has increased by a very small margin. More tests would have been better. There are only 2 tests. There are various other scenarios that could have been tested like missing or wrong attributes in request,email."
1,Yes the team added the test cases. 45/69 new lines have been covered in the� tests. good work. but I feel that they could have added additional -ve test cases.�
1,"The features work as they are supposed to, only problem is with the code using excessive if-else like structure. Code is brittle in this sense. Could have made functions and passed parameters to make it more flexible."
1,"authors have added a new doc in addition to wiki. i think that is not required, they could have simply added that in the wiki.� as in review 1 would have liked a. link to the issue in problem statement� 2.� more details in why this sidekiq was used and not other message queue"
1,The code is ready to be deployed in my opinion to the production server. The team could improve the quality of their code by visiting the code climate tests.
1,yes build passed but there are many code climate warnings that can be easily cleaned up such as tips for refactoring and unassigned variables. A more careful look at the tool warnings was required.
1,"The wiki explains the problem statement well and proposes relevant solution . The team has done a great job on stating the design approach and has included diagrams for them. However, the team needs to add the testing plan for the project."
1,"It seems you have all the needed sections(and then some!). You just need to rename them to project purpose, project design, and testing plan. For example, the section titled Testing should be renamed to Testing Plan.�"
1,Testing plan is missing. Overall looks good. Can add snapshots. Lists out all the functionalities The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations.
1,the project describes the project requirement in detail. the project statement is clear. the team has also included the design/flow which they will be following in order to achieve the desired results. the testing strategy is currently missing from the wiki. the team should inlclude the test plan in the documentation.
1,"It does list out all the functionality, but there seem to be no solutions for them. An insight into the solutions to be implemented would be suggested."
1,"Changes are not currently elaborated upon. There is a section labeled 'implementation"" that will house these details."
1,"Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement.�I say this because even though they have detailed diagrams and solutions in place, they have left important parts like tests and implementation empty. It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution. � �"
1,Good explanation of the proposed changes. You may want to add it in a separate heading. Overall explanation quality is adequate.
1,"As mentioned in the document, some of the proposed changes are not DRY, which I would like to see improved if possible."
1,"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be substantial since there is a good amount of Design aspect in their doc.� Sure, they have defined an application flow, but that is all there is to it.� 1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. Implementation section is left blank.� 2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.� 3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.� 4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.� 5. Yes. Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause. � �"
1,"Though the author has not used UML diagram, but the author has used other forms of picrorial representation to convey what he meant to say. But, the team should definitely consider adding one or two i the future."
1,"Design document explains the entire project flow very well. The whole implementation plan is very well written which clearly explains how the team is planing to work on project. The idea of including screenshots which explains how the functionality will look like once all the implementation is done is what I liked the most. Suggestion: Team should include test plan in the doc.The purpose of project should be explained more clearly. Overall, nice work!"
1,There is a good amount of Diagrams technicality in terms of the section of Workflow flow �and Models and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.� 1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities. 2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. 3. The diagrams are technically sound enough to define problem scenario.�
1,Could be better if you add the screens. Only conventional flow of diagrams is present. Adequate details.
1,the team have explained the flow of models using data flow diagram and have explained the use case using the use case diagrams. some more designs regarding the approach of implementation can be added in the documentations such as sequence diagrams/class diagrams for new classes/modified classes.
1,The document seems to be complete except the test plan. It would be better to include a test plan in the document.
1,The authors have dine a good job of detailing the issues at hand and their proposed solution. UML diagrams like a flowchart could have been used to further clarify the working of the proposed design.
1,�Some more specific details could be added
1,The team has provided enough explanation about how they are going to work on this project. Overall quality of explanation is good.� Suggestion: Include the purpose of implementing these functions/changes.
1,"The explanation is clear to follow but it could also include some more of the abstract design like UML diagrams, explanation of the use cases etc.�"
1,The authors have done a pretty good job with explaining the proposed design. They have used wire frames to show us exactly where the changes are to be made. Adding a flow chart would make things much clearer.
1,I think their designs look complicated and there might be existing gems that can be simplified.
1,"The design seems to be sound. I would like more details on the database of the Bacui projects seeing as most of us don't know what they look like given that most of us have worked on Expertiza projects. So, a short description of the different tables the project is going to interact with along with any and all modifications would really help understand IF there will be any possibility that the design would turn out to be non-DRY or smelly.I think the team is good on what gems are to be used."
1,Screenshot explains the functionality of project very well.It is really easier to understand how the end product will look like. Suggestion:�the team�should include a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality.�
1,The whole document is easy to understand and well-written. Suggestion: It would be better to include what tools and technologies would be used in the project.
1,Good that you have used screenshots to explain the approach. Include Use case and activity/flow diagrams also.
1,The doc contains almost everything in terms of design except for the test plan. You might want to add a test plan right away to go for a test-driven development.
1,The team has very well explained the Goals and separation of concerns. The team could have 'proposed' a way to test the implementation.
1,The project goals are stated in a simple and precise manner. The design document is readable and easy to understand from. They have provided the reader with the background which states the need to do the refactoring. They can include or add file names which they are about to change.
1,"The authors have done a great job at analyzing the problem statement and explaining clearly their proposed solution. I could easily understand the problem statement from the write-up. Well written. However, the test plan is missing from the design document.� Suggestion :� You might want to add few success test cases and few edge test cases for removing reports. �"
1,The doc is complete except the Test Plan. A test plan would make it complete.�
1,"The design document coherently describes the project details including it's purpose and design. This helps to perceive implementation being carried out by the team to achieve the project goals. However, it could be improved by providing the test cases that have been carried out to get to the present state.�"
1,"The team has efficiently described the problem statement and the need for undertaking such a project. Good effort. As it talks about refactoring, few more lines on the pain points of current design would have helped a great deal in appreciating the project. The design selection is great. Apt to the problem and the UML diagram to visualize it, is helpful. The UML diagram should have been more descriptive on how the current code is to be modified to incorporate the proposed design pattern, as it was not easily to know, if this pattern would fit the current code. Test plan is missing."
1,"The project design and project purpose parts are pretty detailed. However, for the test part, the authors only state that they will write tests for the new controller but no detailed test plan."
1,"The authors have divided the design into sub-tasks which shows that they are very clear about their approach. As per the problem statement, the added functionality seems complete to me. Suggestion:�� You could include an application flow diagram to elaborate more on how your solution will work."
1,"The design incorporates the basic functionalities required that include refactoring the review_mapping_controller file, to extrapolate it's features to the reports_controller file. It must also mention the procedure that the team would follow to move the reports from response_report method to the controller file."
1,The authors have provided a nice pictorial description of different strategies using a UML diagram. The could add CRC cards or use cases or the application flow diagrams which will aide in the report presentation.
1,� The authors have done a good job by identifying the sub-classes they plan to add. It would be good to have an overview of the class definitions. It is quite clear from the explanation that they plan to have different tasks depending upon the type of report to be removed.
1,"The explanations are provided as points which is very easy to follow and understand. Though, the need for the proposed UI change is not very clear to me. Few more details on actually how the strategy pattern is going to be incorporated in current code would have been insightful.    The explanation on the test controller is ambiguous.� ��"
1,The document does not explain the reason behind creating the new class ReportStrategy.
1,"It appears from the design that the authors have identified strategy pattern for implementation, which is a good design. I think that they can talk more about the design by specifying an overview of the new controller, i.e. specifying the methods they plan to add."
1,The design proposed by the team specifies an addition of a new button to the buttons tray from the existing UI. The button when clicked must bring a menu of additional reports. This functionality should consider the mapping to the review_mapping controller file that will implement the given features.
1,The design seems pretty good. The only drawback is the test plan is missing.
1,"The team has done a good job with the UML diagram. However, in my opinion, it would be better if they can add details for all the classes in the diagram."
1,The UML diagram shows the various subclasses clearly. It would have been better if it had also explained a few attributes/ methods.
1,"�More or less an A for effort, but I don't know if the UML is fine with so little in it because we don't care about what those classes do, or if we should care and there should be more about those classes and their states and behaviors."
1,"The teams implementation of a UML diagram seems to be a good way of representing the changes planned.The diagram could have been detailed with regards to the classes that are being added and modified. There should be attributes of each class , then the methods that are added or changed with the type of inputs to these methods and return types of these methods."
1,"the authors have made it clear by including mock-up screen of the proposed solution.� They have used class uml diagram for the newly identified sub-classes and hence, I think that they have made adequate use of visual aids. Suggestion: They can add use cases for the new feature."
1,The UML diagram is having the correct contents but needs the rough names of class methods
1,"1)���� The diagram provided is a generalization for strategy pattern and more aligned to help give a simpler outlook 2)���� The standards are not followed, as it should indicate the class type (as an interface) and the method implementations needed in the concrete classes 3)���� The UML is high-level indication. More project specific diagram is needed �"
1,A brief�description for the class level implementation would be better.
1,"The document clearly states what is missing and how they are planning to implement that thing , they state how many new criterion are they going to add to the search feature, However, I would suggest them to include how will they implement it. There is no explanation of how things will be done."
1,search questionnaire and search reviews don't have detailed explanation of what should be done.
1,"The explanations seem very clear. Although, splitting the ER diagram into 1 or 2 more sections would have made the design simple to understand in my opinion."
1,it could be better if you tell in which files you'll be making those changes and if you'll create new functions or make change in existing functions.
1,Team has given information on how it will work after the the project is done. Could have given more detail on Design using UML diagrams and Files invovled in the Project
1,"The changes proposed by the authors are elaborate overall. They have defined the changes extensively. However, the ""Search for Reviews"" section could have elaborated more about the search functionality. The authors could have explained what could be searched and how the search functionality can be used a little more elaborately.�"
1,uml is missing but er diagram is given. you can add a uml diagram it explains things better.�
1,"They have depicted their working strategy through an ER diagram. However, I would suggest them to include more UML diagrams to enhance understandability. Also, the ER diagram is somewhat incomplete."
1,"I feel the diagram is more complex, team could have gone with some usecase/UML/CRC diagrams"
1,Just one ER diagram. Add use case and activity/flow diagrams.
1,"There is an ER diagram helps the reviewer understand the relationship between different sets. Maybe more screenshot can be provided to show where is the search bar, etc."
1,They have very well stated of about the purpose of their project. they have properly mentioned about the flow of their project which includes the flow chart for their project and also have specified of what kind of graphs they would prefer to show the visualization to the instructor. They have mentioned about how they will proceed in test case but haven't specified which files needs to be test inclusion of that would make the doc more complete
1,"Wrtie up clearly explains the project purpose, what changes needs to be made, however including a mock test plan would have been better."
1,"Most of parts are included, but they should include more details in their doc."
1,The team has a well composed design document. they have structured there design document into well written sub parts like design purpose and visualizations and files to be changed. They could have written there testing plan in a more elaborate manner by mentioning what kind of testing frame works will be used and what functionalities will be tested. The could have also added some use cases.
1,"The design doc contains project purpose, project design and testing plan in the wiki. The wiki contains mock visualizations which make it easy to understand the project proposal and how are they planning to do. The design flow as a flow chart adds to the ease of understanding. The test plan explains about the technologies that they are planning to use for testing. Suggestion:� The test plan could say what should be done in testing than just the technologies to be used for a particular part of code. For ed, we plan to have a dummy small data and see if the graphs output the visualizations correctly, if the sum id being counted to 100% of the class participation etc... the stacked version could also have been represented for better understanding."
1,"The document shows the flow of work really well.However, I would like to suggest to put more of test planning and the tools and technologies that will be used. This will enhance the quality of the document to a great extent."
1,"The design doc is good and provides a clear picture about the objective of the project. However,It would also be nice to know what features would be tested in the test plan."
1,"The documentation covered almost everything from project purpose, design flow as well as some info on what files will be changed in the project.� Suggestion: I feel that the test plan was a bit vague. Some more details should have been provided. For example- What all features will be tested. Or maybe some info about edge cases and different scenarios that will be covered.�"
1,"The design incorporates and clearly explains flow of diagram for class performance, but not much is included for Integration of review performance. suggestion : The topic of Integration of review performance can be talked about in brief ."
1,Yes the design incorporated all functionality required. But more explanation is needed around which graph they intend to show.
1,The design follows the basic functionality expected by proposing a bar graph solution for the select criteria. It could incorporate the rubrics that the team are planning to target. The flow in general does help to understand the project.
1,"The explanation is quite well documented such as including the flow chart , kind of bar graphs they would prefer and the files that they will update. Adding of screenshots of the flow of the website would make it more easy to understand for a leyman."
1,"The overall quality of the explanations are good, but they should include more details about their design, which may not be easy to understand."
1,the team has mentioned all the files that will be changed and have also written a paragraph stating what are the proposed changes. The team could also document the changes that are being made to individual code files stating the changes done using code snippets and the reason why the changes are being made. Also they can talk about what design patterns principle are being used to incorporate the functionality that is being proposed. The team could also use CRC cards to depict the proposed code changes. This will not only help readers understand the report better but also help the team in dividing work between the team members and fast tracking the completion of project.
1,"More explanation around only those two graphs are being considered is needed. While its early in the project, at least what changes will be made to a file could have been mentioned."
1,proposed changes needs more explanation at the files and system specifically what files needs to be changed and how
1,"The changes proposed by the team include implementing a bar chart, stacked or single. Based upon the project description, it is advised that the team look for other alternatives like pie chart that would help to span the�results�with a minimal look.� � � �"
1,"The proposed solution�sounds good. They haven't really mentioned�the changes in turn of programmer language. I couldn't visualize how are they going to make changes. They have mentioned few�html.erb file but I think they would need put a good amount of work to implement the new feature. I think the team could have been more precise in their approach, for example, they could have included what all new methods they need to add or modify the existing one."
1,"So far whatever is discussed seems to go in the right direction.However, not much research is done so far. I would suggest them to quickly start researching about how they are going to work and how will the technologies they plan to use work."
1,The team has given a design flow that underlines the basic way in which they are planning to target the issue at hand. It can make use by giving an example as to how the output might look and the document must also describe the tools that would be used for achieving the task.
1,The design looks good enough. It mostly deals with html.erb files to accommodate the graph and some database filtering in the controllers.I do not think that the design will increase the responses time of the system. Suggestion: If the details regarding how the graph will be implemented or any gem will be used should have been given. I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That too would have been useful.�
1,The have included a detailed design flow representation and have also included the visualizations. The could have added Lo-Fi UI cards to depict changes to views which will help them visualize the changes and also help instructors in suggesting improvements at an early stage which will help reduce unnecessary code changes in latter stages of the project.
1,One flow chart and one chart graph are included. I find the�chart incomplete and confusing too. I wasn't able to relate how this is going to help real scenario. The better way would be to use a use case diagram or take example of our current class programs.
1,The team has attached a bar chart for visualization which helps in understanding their purpose. Suggestion : More visual aids could have been added. The stacked bar chart as mentioned earlier . More mockups could have been added.
1,The design diagram is good and it would also be helpful to have a few screenshots of the current expertiza�view.
1,A flowchart and graph has been shown in the documentation.� Suggestions: I feel that there should have been mockups of the screens where the functionality will actually appear. Team should have shown how the solution would look like on the expertiza page. There could have been use case diagrams too.�
1,Two graphs provided provide a good understanding of the�process and what expected visualization should be. More diagrams would have been helpful.
1,All good components of a design document are present. It would be nice to have the UI mockups without handwriting that may make it hard to read.
1,All the components are present in the wiki however more effort could have been made to make sure the formatting and overall structure follows a pattern. Some of the elements are haphazard and could have been redone. UI mockups are not clear. Good effort though!
1,The document is well written Just that a UML�diagram or something�similar�could have been included to make it clearer and easier for the reader to understand.
1,"Good work on problem statement and implementation ideas. However, screenshots could have added. LoFi sketches and flowcharts missing.�"
1,"This is one area where the authors could have improved. Even though there is a good amount of textual description and images, the authors could have added a snapshot of the code changes that they wanted to propose. This would make it clear as to the exact changes that you propose and further help answer this question."
1,Would be good to include� high level overview of changes made in the files.�
1,The author has mentioned which files have to be changed but no mention has been made of how they are going to be changed. Could have expanded a bit more on that aspect
1,The problem statement could have been elaborated a bit more. One line doesnt�seem enough here.
1,"Could have added UML diagrams, LoFi sketches and flowcharts."
1,No uml�diagrams present - can create a simple use case diagram to indicate the flow of the solution
1,"As mentioned previously, the UI mockups are decent but�don't necessarily convey the overall design concept to those not familiar with the expertiza system.�"
1,"They used UI mockups to explain their implementation. Though, some UML diagrams like USE case would be preferred over this."
1,There were few hand-made diagrams posted however I feel used of some other high-level UML diagrams and screenshots would have been better.
1,"The hand drawn diagrams are good enough to explain the problem to others , next time they can update it with�the actual page once its done."
1,"The project design and the testing plans are well laid out. Solution part does not have any description in it, says it will be given in the detailed design. Could have given some idea on the solution with some flow diagram."
1,"The project writeup is not complete at this moment, as there are a lot of things missing. Like what the team plan to do, and what concretey are its testing techniques. It only mentions the problem statement, and an overview of testing."
1,Only problem statement is explained and nothing about how the team will design the solution. Please add design and UML diagrams.
1,"The project is complete and sound enough in its approach and the implementations and the test plan has been well devised and just shy of application. Even so, in their project they lack two sections of key note, i.e. one is the project design and�the solution approach.� � �"
1,UML diagrams and the solution proposed by the authors to solve the issues is missing.
1,The doc clearly explains the agenda of the whole project. Seems like the team still needs time to understand and devise a plan to tackle the issues identified.
1,Team have decided to give all details after final submission. A Design Doc should be available before starting the Project. I would recommend to provide few details on Project Design (classes involved in the project or application flow etc)
1,"The project purpose is explained with examples but no design or plan to implement is given.� Again under the Test Plan section, a generic�method is given but is not specific to the project.�"
1,"The design doc�for now, specifies only the issues. No approach has been given yet on prospective solutions."
1,Please add more details about the solution.
1,The design document has mentioned the issues which need to be fixed but why these issues are occurring and what will the solution be is missing.
1,"Yes, the functionality required is stated but the idea about how to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of."
1,"Have covered almost all the issues, it would have been better if an implementation plan was provided."
1,"The author hasn't mentioned any prospective changes. So, this couldn't be looked in to."
1,There are no solutions proposed. Just the issues are listed and explained. A possible screenshot or a flow diagram would have been better to catch the proposed solution.
1,"no implementation proposed in the design document, only placeholders. Need more detail for it."
1,Changes are not proposed to a suitable extent as they have mostly elaborated on the problem statement.� It yet remains for them to implement them and explain in explicit details their action plan to arrive at the solution.� They�have even yet to work on the most important part�that is figuring out the solution.�
1,There were no such solutions listed on the basis of which I could suggest some better solutions. A couple of test cases or issue resolutions would have been handful for further suggestions.
1,The author has not written any plans about the implementation. It only states the problem statement. The author needs to do more work in the writeup.
1,"As for the designs proposed by the authors it proves to be a redundant check since there is a minimal amount of Design aspect in their doc.� They haven't even defined an application flow.� 1. Nothing about adding a method to any class has been suggested. As per them most important things are going to be given in the final doc design.� 2. The design hasn't been implemented to the depth to make it a code let alone make it smelly.� 3. Nothing mentioned about the design to make it complicated and the piece of code which they would delve into to ascertain of any pre-existing gems for simplification.� 4. This too is hard to reach a conclusion on since not enough details to answer it with certainty.� 5. Yes. Absolutely, a much more thorough investigation should be carried out and relevant previous work exploration with help solve the cause."
1,There are no diagrams present. It would have been great if a screenshot of a test case or flow diagram was given.
1,Could have added more explanation on the changes proposed by the team.
1,"The project purpose. design and test plan are all explicit and detailed. Just one suggestion that the structure can be more centralized. For example, the 2.3 and 3.3 may better be together, like Overview and Details, which I think may be more specific."
1,i felt there was a need of adding more explanation. Add UML diagram so that it is easily�understood
1,"The explanation is good, The images are very large on the screen and it is hard to spot the changes that you made, consider highlighting the changes to show them better."
1,"The authors have considered the requirements and accordingly designed their solutions. The proposed UI design looks very intuitive and the abstract understanding of the code seems to good. However, the implementation is required to say definitely if it makes the code smelly"
1,The team has not mentioned what method/s they are planning to change inside the controller.
1,The test plan seems a little vague. Maybe the scenarios can be explained in a better way first and then given in bullets.
1,"There are ample screenshots of the UI to help the user understand the flow of the changes made. However, there aren't any UML diagrams that explain the use cases and the design of the newly added functionalities"
1,Need to include uml�diagrams - try t include use case diagram to explain the flow of the solution and a class diagram to explain how you will be implementing the solution.
1,There could be more visual aids to help reviewers get a better understanding of this project.
1,"only screenshots of current web page, may need some diagram to show the design in the future."
1,"The team has provided screenshots to help understand the changes in the UI that need to be reflected. Moreover, the team has included proper steps in which every task is achieved."
1,The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also more test cases should have been included in more detail.
1,"All parts are presented, but need little fore explanation in test plan part."
1,"The document clearly specifies the problem statement. It seems good enough. They have mentioned the API they are planning to use as well as the files to be modified. However, I would like more details on this API and how they plan to integrate it into their project."
1,The document is almost complete. Includes proper planning and demonstration. Only suggestion would be to include more about how the implementation would be done.�
1,"I think technical design lacks details. the section should be more detailed on how this internationalization will work, where will the string be kept. what are the effective changes required across the project test plan should have more tests �"
1,"The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. The doc also specifies what all files will be changes along with how the functionality will look like once the project is deployed.� Suggestion: I feel like the test plan should have been a bit more elaborate. The team did mention one scenario. I feel like there could have been many more. But, as all the required things are present, I am giving this post full stars.�"
1,"The design�encompasses all the features in the specification. It only indicates supporting one more language, though, whereas the design document specifies any language. It seems out of the scope of the project, but what if you used the�Google's Cloud Translation API to translate the static strings�at run time? Then you could support almost any language. There might be licensing issues though."
1,"The explanations are done well but they could be more thorough. Why is the internationalization API and Google Translate needed? Also, will you use a script to edit the views? How would you do that? It seems like too much work to do manually."
1,need to edit test plan�and add more test cases.
1,"The explanations given are succinct and clear. The flow of implementation seems very clear. However, as mentioned before I would like more details on the API"
1,"The changes proposed are quite understandable. However, I would suggest them to clearly provide a clear path how they are going to reach their result. The initial planning is quite appreciable though."
1,I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. The team also has mentioned about the API that they will use. Enough efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it.� Suggestions: No information about the methods that will be implemented has been given in the design document. Availability of such info would have been helpful.
1,"The screen mockups were very nice. Good job! I would like to see a UML diagram for the implementation, i.e. how a reference to a static string in a view eventually maps to the correct yaml file. That would make the design more specific and clear."
1,There are mock-ups of the end result. But there are no other UML diagrams. There should have been some UML diagrams to help explain their design better as well as the flow of the implementation.
1,The only visual aid provided is the screenshot of the before and after page. More UML based diagrams could increase understandability.
1,"No UML diagrams present.� Suggestions: Although the wireframes make it really easier to understand how the end product will look like, the team could have mentioned a use case diagram, or a flowchart depicting the flow of the functionality.�"
1,It is extremely detailed!! Eagerly awaiting updates on implementation and on Code Snippets as and when they happen!
1,The design document is comprehensive and detailed. However there are several parts where the team is not yet sure of what exactly they want to. The document misses out on mention which model/controller they will be making changes to.
1,"The document is well-written. They have described the plan of action along with the different routes they would need to explore in order to complete the task at hand. They also gems that can be used and API to query if gems were not allowed. They have a section called the testing plan, however that doesn't look like a traditional testing plan. It just shows the navigation path that different users would take."
1,"I think the diagrams shown include where you intend to add the metrics, but not how all the metrics will be incorporated, in the next phase make sure to include details for each of these :  Total number of commits. Number of files changed. Lines of Code added Lines of code modified. Lines of code deleted. LOCs that survived until final submission - (exclude from MVP due to the complexity and lower priority)."
1,Get the GitHub pull metrics and show 'em to a person! That person being an instructor!
1,The explanation was perfectly organized and flowing.�Could not have been any better! A sample request response of GitHub metric API would've made it more amazing!
1,"The authors do not mention the model they will be making additions to. I would suggest the team to consider a new controller, since adding new code to�an existing controller may not be OO design."
1,Very good explanation and good work on giving alternatives. It would have been great if the team had added DB design as well but the work done is sufficient.�
1,The explanation given by the authors was pretty straightforward. Looking at the explanations it looks like the authors have thought about different aspects of the problem statement and also of different ways to implement the GitHub metrics integration feature along with the side effects of implementing it in a particular way. e.g one would think that adding the metrics to the database would be a sound solution but given the nature of an open source project and the fact that students would commit beyond the deadline the authors have thought not to add the metrics to the database which is sound and reasonable.
1,They have listed various possibilities to get the task done. The Use Case and UML diagrams also help here. Suggestion : Please add the places where you want to make/have made the changes.�
1,The authors mention gems that they could potentially use. but they do not mention where they'd be adding the associated code.
1,The design is well explained. Need clarification on below: 1) How will this GitHub metrics will be used to grade the student. So how will the final marks for a particular be calculated using the data from GitHub.
1,The design seems to be good. It is still not very clear of the path for implementation or the files that they plan to add and the methods in said files however that is fine considering that this is just the initial stage and not much can be said since we haven't advanced to the implementation stage yet.� The authors seem to doubt whether they are allowed to use any existing gem. I think they should go ahead and use the gems.
1,Proper use case diagram have been added. For next submission team can add UML diagrams.
1,The team have done a good job explaining their problem statement and implementation. But the documentation does not include the testing plan. The team should write about the tests they plan to implement.
1,�Your background and detail of description is excellent. However without a strong background in the topic I could not figure out what a DOM was.� I don't see anything about a test plan but other wise the detail was good.
1,The problem statement and what needs to be done correctly explained.
1,"No test plan, but the project purpose and design are decently well explored (especially if you look at the link to the first project page). I'd recommend pulling forward the diagrams and explanation to save your readers the effort of looking in another place."
1,The documentation states the purpose of the project as implementing OffScreenCanvas API for the Servo browser engine under the Problem Statement. It also includes the proposed design that specifies the flow of the project and the files that are interlinked. The testing plan has not been included in the current version of documentation. I expect that the team is working on it and will include it for the 2nd round after they start the implementation.
1,It would be better if testing plan is included.
1,"The�document covers a number of important topics including the description of Servo, apis and concepts that are going to be used by the team in this project, problem statement, project build and proposed design. However, the testing plan is not discussed. While the instances of testing is certainly mentioned in the document, e.g. ""specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way."" and ""Finally, we�ll test our code by enabling the blob API."" the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested. I would suggest reducing the overall size of the initial sections which�provide an overview of Servo project, Off Screen Canvas, Web workers and Web IDL. They introduce more verbosity to the�document than necessary. Two or three descriptive sentences could be used instead. The reader could refer to�a more detailed information through references. Furthermore, the focus of the problem statement falls on the description of the OffscreenCanvas API making it somewhat redundant. It would be better to emphasize on flashing out the goal of the project and only later provide the reference to the technical details if necessary. Another suggestion would be for the team to identify and elaborate on the 'changes' that are going to be merged in servo."
1,"From my previous review of this project, there have been few additions to the set of functionalities implemented. For the 3rd project (OSS) the team had worked on�OffscreenCanvas.rs (interacts with javascript) and�OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.rs (works on OffScreenCanvas) which are implementations of�OffscreenCanvas.webidl�and��OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D.webidl� (Web IDL files) respectively. In this project, the team has proposed to implement�OffscreenCanvas analogous to�HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D, by reusing some code from the latter and add additional functionalities. They finally propose to implement blob API, to test the contents on the canvas and also support webgl contexts as used in�WebGLRenderingContext."
1,The design incorporated all of the functionality required.
1,"The design document covers�a high level view of the required functionality. The concepts and motivations behind OffScreenCanvasContext2D are extensively discussed. Moreover, the document provides the files�that are going to be changed by the team. The main problem of this design is that there is no detailed explanation or examples of what the final expectations are. I would suggest giving more specific examples of how the proposed API should work and what may be the main challenges of the implementation."
1,"The document needs more details on the implementation of the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D, the support for WebGL contexts, and the Blob API. Also, what is a DOM and a Blob? Those terms should be defined in the design document in case any readers are unfamiliar with them. � � �"
1,�I don't know much about the topic and so it can be hard for me to judge but I would have liked a couple more pictures or other aids to understanding
1,"You can mention that what are you going to do, inorder to acheive�your goal. Like it is mentioned that ""As a part of the third project, we�ve already done with the implementation of OffscreenCanvas interface"" So how are you going to achieve the next implementation?"
1,The design plan portion feels a bit lacking. I found myself wanting more detail about how and what they were going to copy between each implementation and the next. What's going to be filtered out? What's going to be added? I have no clue...
1,nearly perfect
1,"The new design seems to violate the DRY principle. Copying an entire class and then editing it will likely cause problems as you will be using code you did not write and so will not understand as well as your own code. This is probably still a better design decision than writing the offscreen canvas from scratch, however, since it will take less time. Could you use delegation or extension to DRY out the implementation?"
1,"Their design is pretty well, but some part of that are not very detailed."
1,"As stated on previous comment, the design needs more explanation.�"
1,"�The functionalities that the authors plan to add seem logical as they plan to implement OffScreenCanvas as an efficient alternative to HTMLCanvas but with all the functionalities included. �The authors have not discussed about the implementation of the proposed design yet, which I am expecting them to do in the next review. The response time is expected to decrease with the incorporation of OffScreenCanvas because the rendering of the images in the canvas is done independently using web workers �"
1,"The document should expand on the design and make specific assertions about how the changes will be propagated. So far the idea behind the design is to utilize an existing code of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D adding new functionality like blob API on top of that. One suggestion would be to elaborate on that and discuss how the new�functionality�will be merged with existing code, what patterns might be used to increase the efficacy and simplicity of the system."
1,the author did not add methods to wrong class.
1,"No visual aids are present. Though the team have explained their work pretty well, the team should think about adding a few diagrams to better help in the understanding of the project."
1,Some more visual aids would better help the reviewers understand how the Offscreen canvas context would be different to the existing environment.
1,Try to include use case diagram to indicate your flow and a class diagram of how you'll be implementing the solution.
1,"There are no visual aids on that page, but there are some on the previous page. Some more would definitely be welcome, and should be placed on the final project wiki page."
1,The authors have not included any visual aid in this document. The wiki page of their previous project documentation has a flow chart that has the code flow that shows how the control flows from higher level interface- the specifications in the WebIDL to lower level physical renderer through the intermediate implementation of OffScreenCanvas on Rust and DOM.
1,It would be better to incorporate some visual aids in the design doc.
1,"Unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. I would suggest providing the simplified UML diagram that does not�necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team, but�the ones that the team finds will be�most relevant to the reader."
1,"The project purpose seems to be only a user story, that says what's the deficiencies of te corrent�issues and a terse solution. I wonder if that's comprehensive enough. I would add some more details in terms of the purpose of each function being changed�in a lower level.� There' only a high-level solution , and which files to change� for the project design. They are not detailed enough. I would add some more plans in terms of how to make the change, when to do the change if the changes are inter-dependent. There's no testing plans yet. But I think that should be stated."
1,"The Document mentions the problem statement, and the basic solution that team came up with to solve it. There is no reference to code or functions that might need some modification. Some design talk would be nice."
1,"The design doc is disorganized and difficult to follow. There are no sections for project purpose, project design, or project testing. Consider adding these sections to give order to the document. Also, red front against a white background can be an eye strain for some."
1,The testing plan is not proper. Though the document is nicely presented it does not concentrate on all areas. I would suggest to systematically describe each step.
1,"The document lists all the problem and possible solutions, which is good. However, there could be more details to explain how to implement the solutions, for example, you can tell more about the changes will be made for the specific solution instead just listing the�files need to be changed. Also, the testing plan should be added."
1,"Changes proposed are adequate, but without any reference to code or design diagrams its hard to tell if the proposed solution will work. It is always better to investigate the code instead of writing states such as this ""Maybe the legacy code is in two places hence the two calls"""
1,"5), More effort should be expended on the design. The solution is too high-end, abstract. Also, some screenshots being added would be a lot more helpful. And addressing the above issues will also increase the readability"
1,"Proposed solution is correct, but as i have said in other comments, there should be a design present."
1,"There is an ""Assign grade"" link for everyone, but only ""Perform review"" for certain teams.  But why doesn't ""Perform review"" appear for everyone? Or at least ""Update review"". (Not if a review has been submitted, at least until the next round starts.) �[This was confusing!� Do something that's clearer.] � Sol : The feature as understood from the past project is that  Assign Grade is present for all teams. (Standardize the functionality) Case 1 : No review performed yet -> Perform Review button Case 2 : Review Started -> View Review button, Edit Review button  Case 3 : Review Submitted, Deadline not crossed -> View Review button Case 4 : Review Submitted, Deadline crossed -> Update Review button � Lets always have view review button once review has started, + change the update review name to edit (only available for instructors and TA�s) itself that should be clear i hope. We will make changes in list_submissions.html.erb � Comments: Case 3 and 4 buttons should be switched. If the deadline has been crossed, you should have the option to view the review. Otherwise, you should be able to edit the review."
1,"The design seems pretty good, but the solutions are a little bit unspecific. It would be better if there are more explanations about how to implement the solutions so that the reviews can give you more feedback.�"
1,The write-up is very minimal. I think it should elaborate made�
1,"The project purpose is stated in detail, in the Introduction part. Starting from the background and problem statement ( to improve the quality of report views""). The purpose is stated in five different small goals separately: make changes in view submissions, view scores, view review report, author feedback report and teammate review report five different parts. In terms of project purpose, it's comprehensive and detailed. As for project design, it is carefully outlined in the ""Solution"" and ""Modification of files"" part. I think the project design might needs a bit more description, in terms of what steps needs to do first, and what steps needs to be done next. It seems that all the changes are for the UI, but is there any UI that can be served as a pattern, for the usage of others? Or is there any implementation of one UI dependent on the implementation of another? Here, I think there needs to be more detailed steps. The testing plan includes detailed steps in terms of how to test the implementation as a� end user. I like it very much because it is both succinct and very intuitive. It will be good to add some sample pictures when the project is over and some pictures that display the functionality becomes available."
1,"It says what they will do, but it seems high level. Would appreciate some diagrams or mockups"
1,"The team has done a good job in listing down the project requirements and design. However I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added, for example-: list down a dummy set of data in any one report view, mention how they would like to write a test for this. Say using capybara, and then how to corroborate the result from the view."
1,The doc seems complete. All aspects of the�problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A use-case diagram will be useful to add.
1,The authors can add the project's purpose (why this feature is important/helpful). The authors have mentioned the plan to use tablesorter jQuery to sort the table but No design plan is included. I suggest the team to remove the introduction to expertiza�since it was clearly mentioned in the requirements to not include it.
1,"The design document has clearly mentioned the problem statement and the subtasks that need to be performed. However, it looks a bit incomplete to me. Suggestions: Try adding what were your proposed approaches and a clear reasoning as to why did you choose a particular approach. You can simply remove the statement on Expertiza, as the professor has clearly advised us to avoid doing it. �"
1,"The design document is comprehensive and covers most of the relevant topics. General problem statement is defined clearly and then divided into multiple specific subtasks which�will be addressed by the project. The solution to the problem specifies the library that will be utilized in the implementation and classifies several types of sorting that needs to be done. This is followed by the files that will be modified in the scope of this project. The primary problem is that the document does not provide any extensive discussion about the possible design decisions and implementation strategies. It is stated that scripts have been added at the top of the file to sort the contents of table. I would suggest elaborating on the specifics, what functions are called and how will the javascript function be tied to the html table contents."
1,"The team provided sufficient information on the project purpose and design. The test plan is adequate.  �  �  It would be better, to provide a solid reasoning for incorporating different sorting. Few sorting implementations, ie) by name and team are intuitive. But the need to sort the Author feedback report and teammate review report, in the way suggested by the team, the reasoning is not very apparent. Need more problem statement elaboration."
1,"The document mentions the tools of JQuery sorting table, in fact which API or any sample code that can be referenced to is expected in the document. Also, this project seems to focus on the view part of Expertiza, so the test plan should be more detailed, cover more edge case.�"
1,"Though the pull request has been passed, but the writeup does not explain the details of the implementation, like what sorting algorithm the team has implemented using jQuery etc. The design part of the writeup is very hollow, and needs further refinement."
1,"Yes, all the functionalities, including viewing submission, viewing scores, viewing review report, author feedback report, teammate review report are all available. I believe a more intuitive, detailed explanation or description might be even more useful, while describing the functionalities in the design. Here, such design is still just simply stated as the project goal."
1,Please add more details about the solution. How to code for that functionality is yet to be thought of.
1,"Yes, as per the solution provided, it does seem that the design incorporates the required functionality. It considers sorting on all the specified fields. Suggestions: Since you have mentioned the use of jQuery tablesorte, you may also add explanation as to what is tablesorter and try explaining atleast for one field (e.g. name) as to how does it work to sort the entries. � �"
1,"�Yes, their design seems to cover all the intended functionality requested for the project. But how the team will achieve the few not so straight-forward sorting such as the one indicated in �Author feedback report� is not clear to conclude, their approach will achieve the intended functionality � �"
1,"The explaiantions provided by the author are at a very high level view, and needs further drilling down into the implementation."
1,"The changes being proposed including the modification of 6 files: submission, team title, view, review-report, feedback report, and teammate review report. I think the lists of modifications are comprehensive. But more details needs to be stated: How should we change this list_submissions.html.erb file? Should we only change some lines or should we change the entire pattern? In which file will the sorting be implemented? there does have information on how to sort by JQuery, but there's not yet information, in terms of which file, which part needs to be changed.��"
1,"The proposed changes section of the wikipedia clearly mentions the column names the team would implement sort on. But, how they want to implement the sort could be explained a little more in detail. They mention they would use tablesorter JQuery, but I would suggest to add some sort of a pseudocode that would explain better how exactly does the sorting work."
1,The explanations can be more detailed. Overall understandable.
1,The authors have taken efforts to identify the right places for making the identified changes. It seems that they have already done some changes. Suggestions: I feel that the proposed changes on a high level. You might want to go a level deeper to explain what will your changes be like. You might also consider adding use case for your changes.�
1,The authors provide a list of files that will be modified in the scope of this project and a high level overview of what needs to be done. The rationale behind using a�tablesorter jQuery library and defining the code in the script seems reasonable but the team needs to discuss more�details to further clarity�the solution.�
1,"It states the internal jQuery library they plan to use to achieve the sorting, again more details on implementations are required to be documented to assess the quality of the solution."
1,need some diagram or prototype.�
1,"I believe more effort should be expended on the design. Currently, it is still not so comprehensive. A lot of details can be added in terms of how each file should be modified and how the sorting will be implemented."
1,"The design proposed by the authors appears to be sound. Since this project is only to sort the views, there will be no code added to either the models or controllers. I hope the team only adds one sorting function per view and allows that one function to handle sorting for different columns in that view."
1,"I think that the authors have identified changes in the html.erb files, which looks right to me. As it only deals with the sorted view of instructor reports, the changes must go in the views part of the application.� Suggestion: You can try to add a bit of information on whether your changes include addition of new code, deletion of existing code, or just slightly modifying or extending the existing code and justify it. Query: Do you plan on creating� a drop-down like option to choose from which type of sorting is to be performed? If yes, it is an add-on user-friendly feature."
1,"The authors talk about adding the tablesorter class to the html table and using javascript scripts for further action. There are no apparent problems with this strategy, however I would suggest for the team to elaborate and provide more details on the implementation. For example, it is not possible to understand what the javascript part will look like, how many functions will be used or how they will interact with html."
1,"1)���� The team has already identified the files to be changed, which is a good thing. It looks like, all changes will be handled in the client-side, so not applicable 2)���� I assume, as it is nowhere mentioned, they would be writing a custom js file, the team plans to repeat some of the custom written code, if same functionality is required in 2 different file, which could violate DRY. Team might need to consider such possibility. 3)���� NO, the team is already optimizing by leverage some JavaScript libraries. 4)���� It would as user opts to sort, but here it seems to be a necessary evil. 5)���� Yes, the team can elaborate more on their design approach and provide visual aids to help reader understand the sorting intended better. � �"
1,"The author has not used any UML diagram, nor any other forms of pictorial representation.�"
1,"Although the textual explanation is succinct and nice, there's not yet diagrams or other visual aids available. I think a diagram that depicts the workflow might be very helpful."
1,"Unfortunately the team has missed out on adding any visual aids to the document. I would suggest that where you list all the column names which would be sorted in each view, also add a screenshot of how that view looks at the present moment, and a low-fi sketch of how the view would look after the changes have been implemented."
1,"The authors have not included any diagrams. Though the purpose and proposed changes are understood, the team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality."
1,"Although screenshots are available on the Projects page, it would have been easier to visualize if the page mockups were added in the design document too."
1,"Although the write-up explains the things clearly, visual aids will leverage your proposed changes. Suggestions: You can include UML diagrams like use cases, application flow to elaborate more on your additional changes. You can mock the changes ( editing html page to show proposed changes) which will really help in a better understanding of your design. � � �"
1,"Unfortunately no visual aids are provided in the design. I would suggest providing the simplified UML diagram that does not necessarily capture all of the classes that interact with the ones that will be modified by the team, but the ones that the team finds will be most relevant to the reader."
1,The design data includes most of the important information required to understand the teams plan.
1,The doc seems complete. All aspects of the�problem statement are covered and test plan is also included. A UML diagram may prove to be useful.
1,Good job on UI and test cases. Kindly add UML diagram.
1,"The project documentation looks complete with clear details about the purpose- to enable the students to better analyze their review based on the suggestion metrics (like�volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics). They have delineated the design that includes the files that the team proposes to change (the view-�app/views/response/response.html.erb and the partial app/views/submitted_content/_self_review.html.erb), the screenshot of the existing UI of the review section and how the UI would look after the project with the inclusion of a button to analyze and they have specified that a popup displaying the suggestion metrics will emerge when the button is clicked.� I specifically like how the Test plan includes their feature in the Connextra format. They have mentioned 2 scenarios- one where the student clicks the button without entering text in which case the popup alerts the reviewer saying no text for analysis and the regular scenario when the user clicks the analyze button after entering text in which case the popup displays the suggestion metrics. I wish to suggest an additional scenario where the user can intuitively test the quality of the suggestion metrics, based on the review input. Like for example, there can be test cases which show that the suggestion algorithm detects generic reviews that might be seemingly relevant to the topic but add no customization to the project being reviewed (like how some reviewers menially copy paste the same format of the review to all projects with just minor changes). Overall the team has done a great job with the documentation and I look forward to see the implementation of this project in the upcoming review. �"
1,"The design document contains some extra information, such as a whole paragraph about expertiza, which I think can be skipped and more importance should be put on the design part."
1,The design includes all the functionalities required in the documentation:�https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit# the main goal: to let the TA be able to review any team that has submitted the assignment is well stated. I think some screenshots or other pictures will be more helpful�while explaining the functionalities.
1,"There's no visual aids.� I think other than a screenshot of a finalized result possible, a workflow diagram will also be useful the work design."
1,�Visual aids are missing entirely. No class diagrams are provided either. Tip: you could've provided simple charts or ER diagrams for the design
1,There aren't many visual aids used. It may be a good idea to do some mockups for this project.
1,"The document specifies the problem statement and the ""analyze"" functionality they want to incorporate. However, the design document seems to be incomplete as they have not talked about the exact identified functionality i.e ""analyze"" and the design document section is empty. Suggestion : You can talk about methods you want to add or existing methods you want to modify and how. I think that you can remove the expertiza introduction section as mentioned by the professor. � �"
1,The design incorporates most of the functionality required. It would be nice to have a design diagram.
1,"The authors have provided a high level solution to the problem statement.� They have mentioned that they are going to use an API for suggestion detection, but have not yet identified one. Suggestion: You can survey on the existing APIs and discuss about at least two of them in depth and specify which one you feel is more compatible with expertiza. This will improve your write-up significantly."
1,The explanation of how the received data will be stored/presented is something I would suggest the team to add. The design document also misses out on where the data will be presented in the view.
1,Please add more information on the NLP algorithm team is trying to use.
1,changes are explained well. suggestion detection algorithm an be explained a bit more or how exactly you will be using it. probably some code snippets would help explaining that.
1,The authors have not specified any code changes as of now so I can't comment on it. Suggestion: You might want to add any API Adapter class you plan to implement to generalize the solution for any future API implementations. �
1,More explanation on how to proceed with the implementation could have been added. Could have also added technologies to be used.
1,"A simple enough explanation has been provided for how the functionality will be working.� Suggestion: I feel that the approach that the team will take to implement the functionality should have been explained more elaborately. For example what different possible methods will be implemented. Or how the web service will be used, or what kind of data the web service will provide for suggestion detection.�"
1,The design document seems to be incomplete. The team have done a good job explaining their problem statement and have included their implementation in brief. If the team could build up on this and explain their implementation in more detail while adding a few diagrams to explain the work they plan to do would be great. Also the team have not mentioned any test cases they plan to implement.
1,The design looks incomplete. There are no diagrams or screenshots. Could have added test plans as well.
1,"Only the problem statement and proposed solution are present, it would be helpful to add the test plan asap."
1,Please submit your design plan and add some�visual aids.
1,The design doc looks more or less complete given that it is just phase one of the project. I feel that some screenshots and a more detailed explanation would have been better.
1,It would be better to include testing plan.
1,"There is no problem statement mentioned in the design document. It directly dives into the implementation details. This does not help the reader is understanding the need for a project. There is no test plan, project purpose. The team has tried to provide a design implementation details which is not very descriptive. More effort is needed to enable reader to understand the design better � � � �  �"
1,The design is likely to increase the response time since API requests take time. It is essential to implement a system that keeps track of these API responses and disables this functionality when the API is unresponsive beyond and unreasonable time.
1,The team has discussed the solution which is required for fixing the issue but has not proposed any design for their approach. So�the team should detail their implementation and design for the reader to know what they plan to�implement.
1,The design covers the functionalities but there seem to be no concrete solutions for the same. Some more explanations was expected.
1,"�No, the design approach is very high-level over-view. An MVC design pattern is an obvious conclusion for incorporating any functionality in a web application, but more precise details of the design approach from the team can help the reader in a long way in gaining understanding."
1,The team has suggested reasonable changes to address the problem statement but have not included any details. The team should elaborate on the implementation they plan to do.
1,The authors could have listed out the issues followed by solutions with a diagram and some supporting screenshots. This makes the review easier.
1,"I think the files that the authors plan to modify seems to be quite appropriate. As to the 'smell' of the code that can be ascertained only when they have started writing the code. So far though the design seems sound. There have however been no mention of the existence of any gems. I think the authors should explore that avenue as well as that would probably simplify their task. For example:- I found the gem sentimental that categorizes the phrases into positive, negative and neutral. I think this is something the authors can look into."
1,More effort should be expended on the design.The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.
1,"More explanation regarding the solution would be helpful, explaining which files must be changed, etc. �"
1,Test plan is blank... The diagrams are good but a little more writing on what you are planning to do would have been nice
1,Team needs to work upon adding more content in the document. Project design needs to be explained more with text and bullets. Team should add Test Plan.
1,Can elaborate more on the problem statement and the approach�that you are planning to take
1,The proposed changes sounds good to me. But as I mentioned screenshots help in a better understanding of the problem statement. Moreover a more detailed doc would have been better.
1,Test plan missing. Links section empty(placeholder could have been provided or don't mention it at all). No design proposed.
1,"Detailed design and test plan lacks. For introduction part, the explanation is not clear enough and a little bit confusing. It is better to add more explantation about what the project is and point out the exact purpose clearly."
1,Explained the project and its purpose with the design and files that need to be changed.� Test plan section is created but no description or plan is given.
1,There is a lot of visual help which is good but project design could have been expanded upon more
1,"The deign gives some use cases for this project, but compared to all the functionality required for this project, it is not enough. More detailed description about the design of other things need to be added, such as model, view."
1,I do not think that the design will increase the response time of the system. Suggestion: I did not find any details regarding about any methods that will be used to implement the functionality. That would have been useful. The test plan does mention��ViewSuggestionMetricsForReviewSegment though. If this is the method name then it does not follow snake casing.�
1,"The project purpose is stated, but not extremely clearly. It seems that in the ""Introduction"" part, there's just copy-pasted messages from the question statement. The flowchart in the introduction part is good, but where should this checkbox be implemented? It seems that here it should only be implemented in the instructor/administrator end, instead of students end. But that's not clearly stated in the project purpose part. The project design is also not very detailed. The title "" Do Some Changes"" doesn't seems to be very serious, but apart from that, the implementation details are also copy pasted from the online project requirements. the two picture of before and after illustration looks nice enough. It's good that the team has found some extra sources that would allow them to get this before and after picture.� The testing plan is not stated at all..."
1,The quality is of explanation is good and easy to follow. The team might want to add some low-level details for the code changes.
1,"I think the testing plan is missing, others are good."
1,These explanations feel kinda minimalist
1,Design plan of the document only explains algorithm or flow for the code change. Team should explain the changes from existing system� to proposed solution with some texts.
1,"Yes, they include project purpose, project design. It would be better if they include the testing plan."
1,You can explain more on what actually are you planning to change.
1,"The flowchart in the design doc explains their problem purpose clearly. Few improvements could be : The document didnt contain testing plan Project purpose i.e, introduction can be more detailed � � �"
1,"As mentioned above, the document lacks a lot of details. The proposed changes have not been mentioned."
1,"The project includes the problem statement. The team has described the problem statement in detail and has also provided visual aids. However, the team could have also included the way in which they implement these changes.�"
1,Problem statement and the expected flow are clearly explained. I somehow feel that the name of this project and the requirements(problem statement) are not matching. � Other missing items: Test plans UML diagrams(except flow diagram). Low-level design details.
1,UML diagrams are not provided. Please add it.
1,The design document looks incomplete with only the introduction and project purpose sections that are mostly copy pasted from the problem statement provided. The proposed design seems to be limited to just an image. Also please consider changing the title 'Do Some Changes' to 'Problem Statement' or something more appropriate.
1,"1. The grammar in introduction may need improvement to be more understandable. 2. For abbreviations, it would be better to give explanations to help others understand."
1,The reuse of the questionaire class is smart to reduce duplication. Otherwise the minimal explanations make it hard to judge
1,"According to the project requirement�https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit#heading=h.654oe3xw5p73� The design has nearly copy pasted all the textual explanation from here, but there's a lot of details that are remained unexplained - is the underlying functionality already implemented, and there's just an UI change that remains to be done? If yes, where is the underlying functionality? In which file? How is it implemented? If not,� then the corresponding implementation is missing in this design document."
1,"The team has included 2 screenshots of the review UI. The first one depicts the existing look and the 2nd one shows that they plan to include a new button that is responsible for analyzing the segmented text corresponding to each rubric where the student has reviewed and also display a pop-up message showing the results of suggestion metrics like�volume, sentiment, suggestion, praise and criticism metrics.� The team has also shown the user story in Connextra format and also described to scenarios- one happy path and one where no text is typed into the segmented text box input.� The team could have made the document even more visually palatable with flow chars / UML diagrams for Use case or Sequence diagram to support the feature and the scenarios they plan to implement."
1,They include the interface required.�They should�include more details about how the functionality should be implemented.
1,Try to give a class diagram inorder to explain�your implementation
1,"The flow has been explained through UML diagram. But, the proposed solution has not been given."
1,"The team could explain the ""design""/solution in a more comprehensive way. The team has only pasted the description given in the google doc�"
1,"Since the document is mostly copy pasted from the problem statement, it covers what needs to be done. But it has not discussed about how it needs to be done. Adding the exact changes to be made makes it easier to understand the solution proposed."
1,Not detailed design was provided. These information was not included.
1,The design has explained the use cases with proper diagrams but design to implement them is not absent.
1,The authors have provided a mock-up of their final design which seems pretty good. However what's missing is UML diagrams. Something that would help understand the flow of functionality would be useful.
1,The screenshots posted give a clear picture of the intended output. It would be nice to have a design diagram.
1,It would be better to add more diagrams.
1,There are no such design explanations on which I can improve or suggest on. It would have been great if there were some more explanations.
1,"The proposed design looks fine for now, but more details are required in order to make a better judgement. So I think that more effort should be expended."
1,"Author does not explain the approach they are going to use. Team should add�project purpose, project design to show case how they are going to tackle the issue."
1,"The changes being proposed here are not comprehensive. It just talks about adding an option ""allow students to join review later"" but it doesn't say how. It also doesn't say whether it's a change in the administrator end or where. Also, as being stated in the above question, is the underlying functionality already implemented, and there's just�an UI�change that remains to be done? If yes, where is the underlying functionality? In which file? How is it implemented? If not,� then the corresponding implementation is missing in this design document."
1,The authors have only mentioned about adding a checkbox field to the view. More changes will be required in order to enforce the deadlines on the students. Suggestion: Add a section called Design Plan to the wiki and mention a rough idea of how you are going to approach the project.
1,"They include the interface required. They should include more details about their design, like how to implement and what need to be changed."
1,I think more effort should be expended on the design. The addition of MVC suggested in the solution is vaguely explained.�
1,The explanations were inadequate and could have been given more elaborately written. The document just contains the details given in the user story document by professor. More content can be added and the flow of logic can be added. �
1,"As stated above, it is difficult to understand the team's own solution to the given issue. The team could provide the paths to the files that they think should be changed. It would increase the readability of the documentation."
1,The changes are explained by the authors. The quality of the explanation�can be improved. Authors could have explained the changes a little more elaborately. The explanation is a little high level.
1,The authors have provided a minimal explanation of the changes to be made. They have mentioned about the UI changes and not discussed further. It would be good to include the underlying changes. The team has identified a view file under the potentially modified files. They have not explored the controller and other files that need to be modified in order to support this. A design document needs to holistically portray your design and so it will be great if such details could be included.
1,"The authors have provided a mock up screen of the proposed solution. which clarifies how their solution will look like. However, the use of visual aids seems to be inadequate since, they have not added any class diagram, use-case or sequence diagram to elaborate their solution in depth. Suggestion: You might want to add a diagram for your proposed design pattern as suggested above to improvise your write-up"
1,No visual aids�are included. feel the team should include more visual aid to help the reader in understanding their problem and its implementation.
1,"Team can explain the algorithm they are going to follow or mention part of files they are going to make changes in. As changes do not seem heavy , it should not increase system response time. Team needs to put more efforts expended on the design and explain the efforts."
1,There are no UML diagrams or screenshots. Please include the same in the following submissions to make the design document stronger.
1,"I believe a lot more effort should be expeneded�on the design. As being addressed above, there are a lot of questions that are not addressed at all in this document. The formatting is not nice either.�"
1,"No design has been yet proposed by the author, however the goal of the project has been well described. Most of the write-up is the same as mentioned in the Google doc. Suggestion: Expand more on what changes need to be done in order to achieve the end result."
1,They have included the initial design. It's suggested that they include more details about the design.
1,The change is little and consists of only one html file. Shouldnt make the code smelly
1,The team has not submitted code that should be added/implemented.� Suggestion: the team can add code snippets in the documentation along with the file names in which the changes should be done.
1,Code level details are not covered in the doc. But the changes suggested follow the desired requirements.�
1,The authors have added the methods in the right class. The code is refactored properly. Appropriate gems have been used. The new system does not increase the response time and is efficient. More effort could have been put in the documentation by providing more UML diagrams and also by designing a test plan.
1,The authors have talked about only the UI and not the underlying code. So it is difficult to assess the quality of the change. As far as the UI is concerned the authors have taken a right direction to place the checkbox. Providing further details about the proposed solution including the changes� needed in the controller code to support the UI change will help explain it.
1,A use case diagram is provided in the documentation. The team should add a class diagram as well to give an idea of the low-level implementation. �
1,Yes visual aid has been provided in the form of Flow charts and screen shots. UML could added.
1,The diagrams are very very large on the webpage. Consider making them half the size.
1,"Team has added a diagram that explains the problem statement and its effects, very well. Team could add UML diagrams to explain the application, changes, sequence of actions, state , actors involved."
1,There's a flow chart about how the end result look like. But the flow chart only tells a user story. There's no detailed implementation plan in this flow chart. 3):��some diagrams are too high-level design and do not provide enough details. applies here.
1,"Team has majorly include diagrams for the code change and algorithm flows. Team should add UML diagrams to explain flow of the application change, sequence of actions, actors involved.�"
1,"The authors have included a flowchart which concisely explains the functionality that the authors are going to add. They have also included 2 screenshots of the UI, showing the end result in the 'after' image. UML diagrams are not included. Please add, will give an understanding of how the implementation will be done."
1,The diagrams is detailed and easy to understand. But it is a bit too long. The team can simplify it.
1,"Screenshots which were included was explanatory. More figures such as logic flow, wireframes etc can be added for better understanding."
1,Use case diagrams explain the requirements properly but no system design related diagram or mock ups are given.
1,"No diagrams are present, would help reviewers better understand what is going on."
1,Wireframes have been given stating what the end product will look like. But I did not find any UML diagrams or tables.� Suggestion: The team could have mentioned use case diagrams or a flow chart explaining the flow of the functionality.
1,"The document contains a�flow diagram that analyzes the system's requirements and expected flow. However, it can certainly make use of other UML diagrams in the expected flow section�to give more clarity about the requirements and the sequence of actions.�"
1,"A flow chart is depicted in the documentation. However, other UML diagrams could have been represented�to show the structure and the sequence of the project. The flow chart depicted is a little�high level. The total capacity�of the project could have been represented by more UML diagrams."
1,"Diagrams for use cases are given properly, but the class diagram is missing."
1,The flow diagram used is basically a pictorial representation of the problem statement and so it does not really add any more value. It would be really helpful if the authors could include a real flow diagram that shows the actual flow of events. The screenshots provided help us to understand what changes the authors are expecting in the UI.
1,The flow charts are good and help a lot in understanding the work. Again. it would be better to explain the abbreviations.
1,"Unfortunately there were no visual aids provided, even though they went through the plan in a good way but few diagrams would definitely help."
1,It would be better to add some UML diagrams.
1,There are no visual aids given. Maybe some flow charts or screenshots can be added to help people understand the project.
1,No diagrams included in the document. Adding some diagrams to explain what the system is and how the design will look like will be better.
1,"There is a webpage linked which is helpful, but I do not see any other visual aids. It would be better to have some screenshots to help the reader understand your project."
1,"The team did a good job in explaining the problem statements for each issue and�providing their proposed solutions. The purpose of the project is clear from the document as is a composite of several�independent issues. The problem is that testing plan is missing from the project. I would suggest starting from the most basic test cases that check the functionality (e.g. one spec per issue) and then elaborating from there. Moreover, while�fixing some issues like�#1008 and #1065 consists of a�small�modification to the existing code, there are other cases where the design decisions are not�provided and it would be better for the team to include some justifications and possible discussions of design patterns. The�document extensively uses diagrams that depict application flows for each use case which is impressive."
1,Following can be added.  Project Introduction & Motivation Description of Project
1,Everything looks great as they have added the uml diagrams ad explained everything in detail. Test plan is missing which can be added as they are�solving a lot of issues in this project.
1,"The design document is extremely well written. The project purpose is mentioned, although it�looks similar to what is already mentioned in�the Google design document. I would suggest the team to add their own understanding of the project, how this project is helpful to the system ? Why are these changes/project necessary ? Additionally I would also suggest the team to add a test plan section to their documentation. Any bugs fixed need to be tested thoroughly for edge cases as well as core fucntionality.�"
1,"The project design is well presented and solves all issues. However, testing plan and project purpose are missing. You could have given at-least a basic high level overview of testing in the end, Overall good effort!"
1,The design incorporates all the functionality required. Suggestion: Including screenshots or screen-mockups would make the document easier to understand.
1,The issues are addressed thoroughly. But probablty the issue on staggered deadline needs to be handled carefully the solution might cause other code effects need to cover all the individuals involved
1,"Its good, can be more elaborative. Also in sections where you have added the code changes, you ca add comments to the code as well for better understanding."
1,"For the bugs which have explanations, the proposed fixes and explanations of the problem are sound. I'd like more info on bugs #1017 and #1072, as they only have the flow."
1,The explanations are well written and describe the workflow well. There could have been a little more detail in the explanation as some of the statements are very high level.
1,"A fix for the second and fourth issues is missing at the current moment. If this is included as in the other issues then the document will adequately propose solutions. Also, perhaps more elaboration on the 3rd fix on how the columns are not being copied over (I know the code is pasted but a simple worded explanation would be nice too)."
1,Overall work is done good. But Explanations are bit lengthy and somewhat hard to follow. Ther is no need to mention the existing code.Which simplymmakes the documentation lengthier.
1,The design looks a bit complicated and will increase the response time of the system. It can make the code smelly. Too complicated code handled in issue 1 which could be refactored.
1,"The design is well though of however instead of writing the time difference logic, gems could have been used which are well tested and bug free."
1,"I would appreciate a little more detail on bugs #1017 and #1072, which have a flow established, but no code snippets."
1,"I don't think the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class. They are modifying the right files. The new design does not appear to potentially make the code ""smelly"". But for few issues you haven't added any files which you'll be modifying, only the uml is given, you can add them before the final submission."
1,"The team has provided solutions for all the issue but one. For issue#1017, the team has only provided a flow chart(description of the issue graphically) but the code which needs to be changed/added should be looked upon.� � Suggestion: The team can mention the way in which they attempt to tackle the issue by mentioning the files and the logic behind the proposed solution."
1,"The designs that the authors have proposed are consistent with the code and do not introduce any obvious problems. However, the�design decisions for issues #1017 and�#1072 are missing and therefore cannot be assessed. I would suggest�including the discussion of the specific parts of the source code that�are going to be�addressed�in this project. Posting the exact solution is not necessary."
1,The diagrams provided clearly explain the flow control of the proposed solutions. The team even mentions preconditions needed for the flow control. the only suggestion I have is that the team could also add a low-fi sketch or screenshot of how the view would like after before/after Issue #1008 is fixed.
1,"Document is explained well with clear understanding of the issue. Problem statement, design plan is explained well. Team can work on adding test plans. As well as well diagrams and screenshots to make the document more explanatory."
1,"Document is explained well. Also the flow of document is good. Team can add screenshots of existing documents, also some diagram to explain the solution well."
1,"No UML diagrams included in the document. Please include application flow diagram, state diagram or sequence diagram or Use Case diagrams to make the document for readable. �"
1,"The team has explained the problem statement well� and has done job in explaining the flow for every user with diagrams for them. However, the team needs to add the design approach and the testing plan for the project."
1,"Only a single UML diagram is present, but I'd have appreciated a couple of flow charts to accompany the expected�flows."
1,"The problem statements and design have been explained. But the team could have explained how they have planned to carry out the changes. Though this could be a vague idea, it could have been added. Likewise with the test plan too."
1,"The design document describes the problem statement, the approach towards the goal and the flow expected for the given issue. Certain improvements can be made to the introduction by providing a brief overview of the project details instead of introducing the Expertiza environment. The team plans on updating the test plan after implementation."
1,"The document contains a UML Use Case Diagram that analyze the system's requirements and describes the actors involved and the relationship between them. It helps to understand the overview of the project details. However, it can certainly make use of a flow diagram in the Expected Flow section that gives more clarity about the sequence of actions. The flow diagram can follow from the use case diagram to show the tasks performed by the actors in a serial order.��"
1,"The test plan is not yet done. Rest, I could see that the document is very much complete."
1,"Except for the test plan, the design doc seems to have all the important details. The team should add a test plan before starting in order to go for a test-driven development.�"
1,"I think the design perfectly captures the view part. However, it looks a bit high level. I think more low level and model related details can be added. For e.g. what design pattern would be used, the tables that will be affected.�"
1,"I think overall it looks good. However, a bit more low-level details may give better insight about such issues."
1,I think the UML diagram can be improved further by adding the classes that are related to the use cases separately. �
1,The Design document states all the required things right from project design to test plan. Files that will be changed along with how functionality will work/flow are included in the doc clearly.� Suggestion: great work! no suggestions required.
1,"The problem statements are much detailed, but they could be more concise. The test plan could probably be elaborated for better explanation."
1,the design covers all tthe major aspects well. I feel that the testing plan could be explained and elaborated in a much better way.
1,"The wiki explains the problem statement very well along with the proposed solution which seems reasonable. But the wiki does not include any test plans as of now. There are a few test cases which can be used to write the test plan, for eg. not adding drop deadline for the assignment itself and assigning each topic a drop deadline and check the behaviour of the system."
1,"Design is very nicely explained with flowchart makes the design flow very clear. Suggestion : If a screenshot of actual screen where the change needs to be made is added, that would be perfect."
1,The overall quality of explanations is precise and clear. Isssue 3 and the test plan can be addressed in more detail. How the testing will be performed must be addressed.
1,The Issue 2 explanation ans Issue 1 solution 2 explanation is a bit hard to follow or seems to be at a high level. It needs to be broken down. All other descriptions are easy to follow. It would have been more helpful if some screenshots of the tables or the screen shots of the screens were included.
1,Great efforts have been taken to convey what is to be done and how the team will do it. The design will definitely increase the response time. Suggestion: Information about the methods that will be implemented is not given in the design document Availability of such info would have been helpful.
1,As stated above all the references needs to be checked as signup sheet controller is populating the database and every field should be available to maintain consistency.
1,There is nothing wrong in current design. Looks good. Suggestion: However Since I have already worked on a similar assignment so I know that similar issue has already been resolved for drop topic deadline. You can reuse the entire code and just change deadline type. Have a look at OSS project topic- 1843.� Check with the Professor once.
1,The use of flowcharts�describe the functioning of the project exceptionally. Suggestion: Including screen mockups to your doc will add more weight to it.
1,The diagrams follow the conventions and are detailed and self explanatory. Suggestion : Test Plan is not so clear. Especially the second testcase where it is stated that the dates will be changed accordingly. What dates will be changed and how should be mentioned. A similar flow-chart� will make it very clear as to what you plan to test.
1,"The design document looks really good. All sections are properly described, screenshots included. A possible uml or workflow diagram would have been appreciated."
1,"This documentation is the first one to clearly give a background for the project, out of all the documentations that I have reviewed until now. Kudos to the team for taking that extra mile. They have clarified the purpose of this project under the Task heading as: to provide a holistic insight into the performance of each student in a class as an objective. The project design includes the view and controller section that projects the requirements of the project. I like how the team has listed all the information to be presented in the Grade Summary. The documentation finally contains the Test plan, where they propose to do controller tests to check if the correct model method is called and if the objects of appropriate datatype are returned and also if the correct view is rendered. They have also listed 2 feature tests to see if the correct information is being rendered on the view. The team could have added more such tests like: to test if the sorting functionality works fine"
1,The design doc is clear and well written. The authors have done a great job explaining the project's purpose and their design plan with the use of LoFi sketch and prototype for the required view. I would suggest the team to include files that are involved for this project. Overall good work!
1,The design does incorporate all of the functionalities. One suggestion that I can give in the context of the design is that the documentation could have covered the list of files that they plan to work on and the current version of that code. They could have shown a UML diagram of the flow of activities for a lucid understandability�
1,"The design incorporates all the primary functionality, however adding a UML diagram would make it much better"
1,"The proposed changes look good, explanations are clear. Also, mentioned the continuous talk with mentor to come up with a prototype. Suggest you to include screenshots of some positive and negative tests in the future submissions. �"
1,"The authors have proposed to create a view for Grade Summary with the details pertaining to the assignment grades, topics, review scores and total scores for each student which gets rendered when a 360 Assessment tab icon is clicked. This change seems logical. They have also depicted a LowFI sketch of the projected page and screenshot of a rough prototype. These changes seem logical to me. I wonder if they are going to reuse any existing code that they cited as prior work in the background. The documentation could have added specifics of the files that they wish to modify or create."
1,"The explanations are succinct. However, in the Controllers section, it is unclear which controller in expertiza project the authors are referring to. The authors could mention the name of the controller(s) they intend to change and also�possible method(s) that might be added to it.�"
1,The explanation�is good and more information on which files would be changed would be more helpful.
1,"The authors have not specified any implementation specific detail pertaining to the specific controller classes that they propose to modify. So I am not in a position to comment if they are making changes in the wrong class or if it will make the code smelly. The design looks precise and there is no need of any additional gems.� The response time of the system should typically not take so long unless the view is rendering extraordinarily many student and assignment information. The team could implement an effective searching algorithm or use of an efficient data structure to store the student grade information. Or, they could possibly use filters to generate only relevant students (say under a specific course, year at a given University ) The authors have put in good effort in the design documentation except for minor additions (like code modifications, file changes and UML diagrams) which can be easily incorporated by the next review."
1,They might like to elaborate more on how they plan to use the hash of students to retrieve the specific information of the assignments. For eg. what models will you be using to query the DB.
1,"The overall look of the page is well explained. However, I could not understand the back-end design�plan, as in how/where the team will be adding such features in the code."
1,"The authors view of the final result is clear, but it is not yet clear on how the project is going to be implemented. i.e what files are going to be changed."
1,"This is the only place I found the authors could improve. There is no mention of the actual files that need to be modified. They have detailed out the change that they propose, but no mention of actual files and the code change. It would be further increase the clarity of the solution if you could include that too."
1,The authors have put in a good amount of effort in creating LowFI sketch (table) of the Grade Summary view with mock data. They have included a rough prototype of the intended view with all student and assignment information. The documentation also shows the Manage Courses view which contains the 360 Assessment icon that links to the Grade Summary page. One suggestion is that the team could have touched upon some implementation detail like showing the code flow as a flowchart or even useful UML diagrams for usecases.
1,Missing a UML. But loved the addition of the LoFI sketch.
1,"The requirement here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Br9hm-SWIvl5ibWSfRVjmiYTQl5j27l8slWhv2iUCqQ/edit#heading=h.654oe3xw5p73� totally appeared in the design document. This is very good because there's a high-level goal being stated. However, the ""important files"" part which includes the Open github�issue, delayed mailer, response controller and response model, only model is mentioned and the other four are not mentioned at all. It should be great if all of these can be mentioned."
1,"Both the project purpose and the project design are not very well stated.� In terms of project purpose, although I was expecting it to appear in the introduction part, it actually did not. The part just stated a high-level abstract goal, being transmitting the conflicting message to the grader. But it's not at all stated in detail. So I went to the proposed solution to find the project purpose. In the proposed solution section, Neither project purpose nor project design was well put. It talks about changes that are expected to be implemented in the file. But they are not talked about in detail. This sentence: ""loop through each review not for calculating the average but to compare the new review score with each review score""� � seems to be not so easy to be understood. The project design seems also to be in the proposed solution section. There's no detailed modification plan, workflow statement, or anything.� The testing plan looks succinct and helpful enough for a tester to use and check the functionality.�"
1,There's no diagrams or any other visual aids available. I would suggest adding at least some workflow diagram.
1,"5) more effort should be expended on the design. I think there are a lot of problems in the design. The changes�to the controller, where the notification is implemented, such questions are not addressed. Also, the questions listed in the above answers are not addressed."
1,"The authors have included all the necessary sections of the design document. However, the document seems to be a very high-level explanation of the problem statement and proposed solutions. Suggestion: You can try elaborating more on the problem statement and the current scenario of the project. e.g. Try explaining what is the threshold for sending an email notification to the users."
1,"The authors have provided a brief design approach of storing the URL and looping it into an email notification, so that instructor would be able to identify which review has been mapped to it. Improvisation: You can try adding information about new functions you wish to add, and if yes, which of the files identified by the mentor do you want to add the function to. This will increase the depth of your design document."
1,"The team has well explained the problem statement along with the application flow which makes it easier to understand about the project. They has also described the method which discusses their proposed implementation. However, it would be helpful to add more details on the design approach they have chosen. The team has also proposed a short test plan on a very high level, which makes senses as this is very early level of the project, but its suggested to add more diverse test cases to it as it would help in handling all the cases during the development of functionality of� self review extension."
1,The design related information is missing. The team has mentioned the problem statement and application flow. They need to add UML diagrams and in the first stage at least the proposed changes are expected.
1,"The design documents looks very crisp and clear. The work flow, proposed solutions and test plans are all listed. Good work. A screenshot or two of the test cases would have made it even better."
1,"The design document is good which covers every aspects from project purpose to the test cases . However, there are some things which I found incomplete. In the problem statement they should first of mention a proper definition� of what is meant by self review as the term is a bit ambiguous and in the flow diagram they have mentioned the flow which represents the UI aspect of the the project and not the flow of how the task would be implemented and thus the flow diagram must be changed�"
1,The doc is well written with all the necessary explanation. More detailed test plan would suffice the need of the document
1,"I don't think anything is missing from their document, but it is in general ""lite"". I would prefer a few more details on how they plan to limit reviews from being viewed until a self-review is complete, or�which places they plan on making changes.�"
1,"The problem statement is nicely explained with the help of flowchart. However some screenshot of the screens where changes need to be made as well a similar flow diagram for solution will be helpful. Test Plan is not stated in details. It just mentions Bullet Points.� In Test Driven Development, adequately defining the test cases is as important as developing a solution as per the problem statement. This should be corrected."
1,"It looks to me from the document that the authors are clear about their implementation. Suggestion: They can elaborate more by specifying how do they intend to store the URLs to the reviews, how are they identifying the two distinctly different reviews. They can also add a basic flow of their proposed solution. This will enhance the explanation."
1,"The new design does not talk about any methods or class definitions, thus I cannot comment on this. Suggestion: You can add more information on methods or any usage of design patterns in order to make the review effective and useful."
1,Visual aids are absent from the write-up. Suggestions: Use cases for email notification can be added. Template/design of the new/modified email can be added.� Any relevant design pattern diagram can be added.
1,"Yes, the functionalities are present. It would have been good if the issues were listed sequentially following its solutions."
1,Yes all the requirements mentioned in the Problem Statement are considered. Also the corresponding solutions are explained . A flow diagram or screenshots explaining the solution jsut like the problem statement is explained would have been helpful.
1,Could have been explained more
1,Needs to work a bit on the plan
1,"The project purpose is well defined and clearly explains what this project aims to do. The team also identifies the strategies they wish to adopt to fix the issue. This explanation is clear and concise. However, I would also suggest the team to add a basic test plan, on how they would test the functionality they add. Also I suggest them to list down the list of files they would be changing."
1,The explanations are good. But a layout in the issue-solution form listed sequentially would have looked better.
1,"The authors propose changes in an extremely concise manner. The idea that the team proposes to follow seems logical, but I would suggest them to include a dummy example or sample pseudocode so that the english explanantion is backed up with an idea of the code as well. Such as this-: 1) Review X is submitted 2) Loop through Review 1......n If abs(Review n score - Review X score) >= (some value) store Review n URL in list �"
1,The author has given a proper explanation of how the things will be implemented by specifying the files that needs to be modified along with how they are going to merge the grades
1,"The team has not provided any visual representation of the work they propose to do. Perhaps the pseudocode mentioned above, could instead be shown as a set of diagrams showing an example for how this fucntionality would be handled when one say 1 Review has a score disparity of more than the threshold for existing 2-3 reviews. The idea here is not to add working screenshots, but a Low-Fi diagram would also help in making the documentation visually more representative."
1,Some screenshots of actual emails sent and proposed format of the new email would be helpful
1,"Could be more specific, especially with test plan."
1,"I think you explained�the change they want to make clear, but maybe�you can state which file you want to make and�how you guys want to change that file."
1,"The team has discussed the implementation details of calculating the composite score. However, as stated above the documentation lacks the detailed design that they are planning to implement."
1,"Yes, they include all the functionality in the wiki page. They can work it better if they add more details and some visual aids."
1,They have mentioned the method to calculate the composite reviews. But where this method is planned to be added in Expertiza�is unclear. This needs to be mentioned.
1,They did explain what they want to do. It's easy to understand and seems reasonable. They can make it more explicit and clear by making it step by step.
1,"It would have been good to show the comparison of the scores calculated with the old model and the new model. This will check if the proposed design is acceptable or just falls in the ""smell"" category."
1,This design is good. There are no visual aids. Maybe they can consider use it to make it more detailed.
1,"Need improvements, can add design by adding UML diagrams and Test Plans.� Technical details with class diagram to explain the code level implementation would have been better."
1,The team has provided the application flow diagram which helps to understand the working of the project. It would be helpful to add design details and the diagram for same so that others can understand the implementation as well.
1,Application flow is present and done well. UML diagrams need to be added.
1,There is a hint of visual aid in terms of the section of Application flow for the Instructor and student and thus we can say that it does slightly help get a sense of putting things into perspective.� 1. None. Both the diagrams seem important enough for the scope of the project and in conjunction with the intended functionalities. 2. The UML diagram is in line with the conventions and follows suite. 3. The diagram of the instructor can be said to be bordering on one to be too high level and should go a bit more into detail. �
1,"The application flow help understands how your design work, but maybe�you can add more visual aids to help understand your design more easily."
1,The current explanation talks only about changes in the view. It would be better if the solution is explained at greater depth.
1,The placement of the document could be changed to make it more readable and the flow of the document to be proper for example the objective should be shifted above the database schema. They have also not included the test cases
1,"The document seems to be generally well-designed. However, I believe that they have glossed over how a link is said to be ""closed"".�They properly described the additional functionality�and the challenges they will likely face."
1,"There are no sections titled project purpose, project design, or testing plan. However, much of the information required to create those sections is provided."
1,the design document seems to be well written and detailed with respect to the objectives that need to be achieved. The team explains well the purpose and project design. they have included the database tables which will be modified. the team could add a testing plan to make the design document look complete.
1,"everything looks great , you can add test plan for this as its a big change in functionalities."
1,"I felt there was just too much overlap and with the doc from previous year:�2017 Project�. Even if the current project is to extend a previous one, the documents aren't supposed to be copied almost word to word. The only major addition I see is the last section. None of the diagram correlate to the new changes being made; they are contextual to the older project. Testing plan is missing from the document. From what I know, even the development projects need that section. Even when the older document was used, no references have been provided for it."
1,"The introduction paragraph contains bullets that are identical to E1791 which is surprising.� The flowchart does not cover ""No"" or negative cases and is thus incomplete. What is logged in the DB and how exactly is ""start"" and ""end"" time is very ambiguous.� Apart from a mention of ""merging the data of the details page on the current report page."" in the introduction, I cannot see any further discussion of this particular�objective. For auto-save, you could think of using the on-unload event of JavaScript (like onload event). Also, setTimeout doesn't seem to be an efficient idea, since that would make too many number of calls from the page (I guess you would be sending an Ajax request, which is asynchronous). A next call might be made before a previous call response is handled. When you say ""For each time the reviewer starts a review, it will check whether a previous record for this review already exists in the database. If it does exist then it will update the end time of this record"" - what if I open a review that I had done two days back? As soon as I open the page, will it mark end_time as now() .? In that case, does that mean I have done this review for 2 days..? �"
1,The design incorporates all the required functionalities. The team could have added Use cases or CRC cards to help convey which parts of code they plan to change and how. Overall the team conveys their objectives.
1,No�all functionalities are not incorporated.�Design and implement a solution that handle GitHub is missing.
1,"While I understand conceptually, I don't believe they explained their changes in appropriate�detail. Simply describing additional columns and a flow chart misses the biggest part of these changes which is user experience. How will windows�pop-up? What will the new data look like after a review is complete?"
1,The authors propose two changes and have mentioned in detail about the flow in which they will make changes. They could benefit from drawing simple LoFi UI cards to illustrate how the new review page might look like which will benefit them in improving their UI design and proper representation of data before they actually spend the man hours in coding it. Overall the have explained the process in detail� and clean fashion.
1,The autosave feature is a pain right now and it is buggy(not sure if it is in the scope of this project) so an option can be given to choose autosave the data after a set of intervals like 5/10/15 mins
1,explanation is good and easy to understand. proposed solution looks good as well. Design and implement a solution that handle GitHub hasn't been explained.
1,"The Introduction was a little confusing as to what this team is going to do. Rather the ""Objective of the project"" section is what clarifies the change the are doing and from that I was able to understand what already exists. The Objective of the project section contains the proposed solutions when the proposed solutions ought to be a separate section."
1,"I think the writing could be done better, with more explanation on why the solutions mentioned in the last paragraph are taken, and what other approaches were considered. Or an explanation of why no alternative exists. With regard to design, explained in detail in a previous comment."
1,"These changes seem to be appropriate�for the objectives they have. Only a small set of files are being changed, and the functionality is isolated well. My only feedback here is that there is likely a place to create helpers or utilities for time tracking."
1,The authors seem to have understood the project and know what changes need to be made to what files. The changes seem to be targeted to the correct classes and preliminary investigation reveals that it does seem to follow DRY principles. They might want to make their design diagram more simplified which will not only help in making it look readable and also help in implementing the code effectively. This will help in reducing convoluted code.
1,It isn't clear what all the Review statistics will be shown in the column. If it is just the time spent then that's fine. But if there are other details as well then it needs to be explained how so much data will be shown in a single cell w/o affecting readability.
1,"As mentioned earlier, the flowchart and simple ER diagram are helpful, but I believe these changes would benefit greatly from having low-fi sketches, and actor diagrams instead of flow-charts."
1,�They have included the flowchart of the flow of the functionality that is being added which seems to be designed properly and readable. Also database table whichthey are going to change is depicted. They could add Class Responsibility Collaborators cards to further illustrate the code changes they are about to make.
1,Would be nice to see a sample test plan
1,Created a great visual aid which helps us explain the plan.
1,"The authors have explained the changes to be made to the system, including screenshots of the tables, UML diagrams as well as all the files that will be modified. Suggestion: Although all the details are explained well in the document, by writing the changes proposed to the files in bullet points or by using a diagram the document will be easier to read."
1,"The design document clearly specifies all the issues that are going to be addressed by this project. UI views are provided which help the reader to better understand the scope of the requirements. Moreover, the authors list the files that are going to be modified and the authors comprehensively describe how the jQuery tablesorter 2.0 library will be used for three types of sorting. One minor improvement would be to highlight the parts associated with introduced changes that link html table with the library for better readability."
1,"The authors have explained about their changes neatly, including previous suggestions. They have added detailed description about tablesorter which they plan to implement. The tablesorter is used to sort data for multiple fields for a table, using multi-tbody sorting. They plan to use it in the grades and review_mapping views. They do not plan to implement in their drop-down, but display the sorted data itself on loading the page.� The changes look more clear to me, as they have been able to implement the changes in the table view using multi-tbody sorting for submissions table. I think that introduction to Expertiza is highly unnecessary and should be removed,"
1,"Yes, the changes are well explained. There are a lot of pictures, snipped screen shots to help explain the changes to be made. There's one issue that the screenshots are not very clear, since it's big. It would look better of the screenshots can be clearer."
1,"yes, the design is the simplest I could think about. But it doesn't include how to change the files.� I think it can still be as simple and succinct if the modifications of files can be included. On the other hand, the expected result seems to be too long. There's too many screenshots"
1,"The screenshots of the expected result and the UML diagram are good, But the screenshots can be smaller to make the page more user-friendly. The UML diagram can be better if it's designed as a design plan diagram instead of a user diagram, which simply states how the reader is to approach this. Or it could be better if we have both."
1,"The authors have included a UML diagram which explains a flow of the diagram The document does not strike a balance in the use of visualization. It lacks at illustrating the changes using appropriate use-cases, mock-up screens to show the expected changes as opposed to the current scenario. The mock-up screen can include sorted values of the field whose headers you clicked upon. Also, there is no need of other visualization aids such as class diagrams, as the modifications are limited to views.�"
1,"There is some explanation about the general idea of what needs to be added to implement the new functionality; however, there are several sections missing that give light to the details of implementation and how this is tested to ensure correctness. Adding a description of where and how this new model will be developed with the existing image would� be beneficial for a thorough understanding of the reader. This could also be achieved by rearranging the logic of the sections as sum sections elude to purpose and intent of implementation."
1,A detailed explanation would have been better
1,The stated design seems to be appropriate. Following a close representation of the current project bidding structure would prove successful. It would have been beneficial to supply more details on how the design would be implemented and could help in the justification of the choices this team used.
1,"Yes, the design proposed by the author seem sound enough. However, the author has only given a high level view of the proposed design. The author should delve deeper into the concept more while describing the intended design."
1,I appreciate the thought of using Delegation pattern. More details on this would have been helpful. Also why was delegation pattern selected in particular?�
1,Visualizations are great for helping to clarify system analysis and relations in this portion of the image. More images on the design and implementation would also be a great addition for further understanding.
1,"The UML diagrams are supposedly the best part of the writeup. Gives a very lucid and engaging representation of the underlying architecture if the system. Also, clearly depicts the understanding of the problem by the team."
1,The visuals are very helpful. More clear view of how delegation pattern is being used would have been appreciable.
1,the team has included the diagrams related to current system analysis and the workflow.� A workflow explains the current design and its similarity with the existing flow used for topics biding. The team could have included some UI mock ups as well to show the views for better understanding.�
1,The section is included by the content is empty. Simply listing steps in how you plan to test for correctness of your model additional would work here.
1,"No, it does not since the approach is to have a new model with delegation I strongly recommend team to add test cases�that ensure systems functionalities are working as it is"
1,The doc is very well outlined but the team must have invested some amount in test cases. It would be really helpful to see how the new controller be tested and how the chosen pattern is able to help in the desired functionality.
1,"The document provided by the team is very detailed and includes all the requirements which are suggested by the Change Request. However, the team may change tone of the document as it is instructive� right now which seems like the change request description itself. The team might also add a wiki link for this document so that it could be included in the expertiza links of existing and ongoing changes and would be more reachable to a wider audience."
1,Yes the authors have tried to explain what changes are required and what they plan to do however I feel that exact changes that they might be doing are missing. They could have listed most files that will need modification and if necessary new files that will be changed
1,"�The design seems to be sound. There are a lot of mention of which files will be modified however, as I said in the previous round, there is no mention of the layout of the existing database or if the changes they will make currently will change the database. Suggestion: Team could mention what tables are present in the database of the Bacui project. I believe this will be really helpful since most of the reviewers are working on Expertiza projects and have no knowledge of Bacui projects. At the very least the team could mention which tables the project will be interacting with along with their structure."
1,Yes the design follows simple rails concepts and is pretty straightforward. I would like to see if the team uses existing gems available to speed up implementation and re use.� �
1,"Yes, looks clean. Any design patterns used????"
1,"Yes, the design appears to be sound. There could be some rearrangement in the mock-up layout, e.g. text box for email address and 'Add' button could have the same horizontal alignment for a better user interface."
1,"Yes, the design is appropriate. It would be better if the authors list the patterns they are going to use."
1,They team has done awesome work in representing every detail possible in the flow diagrams. They have created UML diagrams which depicts the flow of the admin and students along with other actors. As mentioned earlier they have also represented the admin flow diagram and instructor flow diagram through the flow chart which makes it very easy for end user to understand the workflow of the requirements in the expertiza system.
1,"1) In the UML diagram the set of actions that the instructor can perform to add more than one question to nomination and textual type is not added. Also add the actions to modify the display sequence of existing questions. 2) In the instructor flow-chart, the flow for review questionnaire and to modify the display sequence of existing questions is missing."
1,"The diagrams seems to be good for most of the part. One can understand the project by looking at the diagrams itself. However, in one of the instructor flow diagram, it's given that if the instructor's status is pending the instructor will set the limit to 10. That doesn't make sense. Why would the instructor himself/herself set the limit to 10. Isn't this the responsibility of the system itself to handle this or at the most the admin? Suggestions: Change the 'yes' branch of is pending? to loop 10 times or somehow indicate that pending instructors can add only 10 students to an assignment."
1,Yes the presence of use case diagrams and flow charts explaining the work flow is good. It would be nice if there were more uml diagrams such as sequence so show various class interactions.� Presence of mockup screens is good. That helps in understanding what is being implemented. It would have been good if the authors put in more details about the validations that that propose in the system�
1,"Class diagrams are missing. Class diagrams are missing. First flow diagram looks perfect. Second needs some modifications - the instructor login flow should not�include a step to set the count limit to 10. This should have been done before only. You should add a step to perform a check to see if the total students count is crossing the allowed limit(10). If yes, then don't add this new student and�show some proper error message to the user. If no, then add the student."
1,"The mock UIs are well thought of and make navigation easier. A couple of suggestions: - can add another mock UI showing the drop down. - Some types of reports may not exist. If the drop down options are hard-coded, selecting an option might lead to a page with no content (this might be an existing issue I suspect). For every option, you could query for existence of at least one record before putting that option in the drop down."
1,�The test plan is quite good as it covers all the test cases in the form of 11 test cases which test all the functionalities for the admin and the instructor role. It also considers the negative test cases like throwing an exception when the pending instructor tries to add more then 10 students to his/her course.
1,The UML and flow Charts used by the teams are good but can be made more clear and appealing
1,"The UML diagram is good, but the diagram in the test plan is not very helpful; I'd suggest either another UML-ish diagram or just a bulleted list of the features from the Report Controller."
1,Tests can be made more exhaustive. For now it looks like only the view will be tested but controller should be tested as well.
1,"The visualization aids used are class diagram for the strategy pattern, use-cases to explain the test plan. The class diagram is very useful to illustrate the approach used by the team, and it succeeds in explaining. They have made changes according to the suggestion provided in the previous review. A sequence diagram will help understand the flow of the methods from one controller to the other, as the design suggests so."
1,"From the previous stage, the team has added the Use Case Diagram that efficiently describes the actors involved in the process. Also, since a new controller is proposed it was essential to identify the role of the instructor."
1,"�Yes, they have improved the UML diagram from last round and it�s a standard class UML diagram. It�s very self-explanatory. Though the diagram under test plan should be clearer. Also, there could have been a sample report generated for reference."
1,I would the test section incomplete. The authors have mentioned about 11 test cases thats all. I think that is not at all sufficient. Also missing are unit tests if any and UI tests if any.� I would have liked mention of more test cases both automated as well as UI tests that will ensure basic sanity to the system
1,Test plan needs to be expanded to describe each unit/functional test team plans to write for each of the reports.�
1,The testing plan is very neat and comprehensive.� they could have handled more edge cases.
1,"The test plan�covers�all the reports and their creation, as well as data to be rendered using the new button added. You can try adding edge test cases, i.e. the code should not break if data is empty for a report. They have not yet posted the complete plan of testing, and plan to update as per the progress. I would suggest you to take time to define a testing strategy, as it will help in TDD which speeds up the process highly."
1,"Yes, the design includes a test plan. It�s adequate to test all functionality of the newly introduced controllers. It doesn�t talk in detail about the ways the system is to be tested and what is the exact outcome to be verified."
1,"The team has very well explained the changes they are making in the project to achieve the functionality. However, they have not included any design explanation explicitly. They have not described the approach they have come with. It might be helpful if they could add the design approach as well in the wiki link so that its easier to understand the code changes by having a glance at the design pattern."
1,The technical changes required are explained in depth but the usecase or the domain knowledge is not provides properly. This makes it difficult to understand the problem statement properly. Some high-level domain knowledge and requirements background will be helpful.
1,The flowchart added gives a good idea of the final outcome after implementation of the changes proposed. Suggestion: A diagram explaining the plan of changes to be made will make the document easier to read.
1,"Yes, the team has made a very good testing plan, consisting of functional testing, which covers almost all of the use cases which have been added/modified. However, the author could have added code snippets of the same, instead of just discussing the proposed plan."
1,"I suggest the testing plan be improved. In place of giving steps on how a reviewer should test the project, the team should instead list how they wish to write tests for the functionality added. The rspec could be something like expect(page).to have_content(sorted)"
1,"� The test plan has covered test cases for testing functionalities of sorting submissions table and review mappings per field. They can also include test plan for the edge cases of the system, like the code should not break when the submissions table is empty and show should probably display a flash message saying ""no entries to be sorted!"". In this way, try to add a few negative testing to improve your coverage. This will make your code more rigid."
1,"The test plan is present. It consists of a set of functional tests described for each of the five views. I would suggest elaborating on the technical side of tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec. Moreover, it would be better if the team provided a rationale for why it is sufficient to use only functional tests."
1,"The test plan is complete and covers all intended functionalities. They have also provided all necessary steps to test the functionality. Good documentation on test plan. As client-side changes using script is added, a latency test to verify system is not slow in responding to sorting can be included."
1,"As stated above, the team has not explained any design pattern they are following. However they have mentioned all the code changes they are making for this functionality implementation. The code snippets they have included is very useful to understand the exact code changes they are making and the files which are getting impacted. This would help the future developers to understand the� code in a simple manner."
1,Actually they may include too much info. which could be replaced by some links.
1,"They only presents a flow chart, it will be better if there is a UML diagram."
1,"Yes, the design includes a test plan. I think the tests can be more descriptive, including 'what' is being tested and in 'which scenario' the test is being implemented."
1,I feel the test plan should be more descriptive while also covering a few edge cases.
1,"The changes to be made to improve the existing system have been adequately explained in the design document. The filters by which the data needs to be curated have also been stated. However, it would be better if they started by giving a short description of the problem statement and then going into specifics."
1,The design documents is well explained. the authors haven't mentioned any design pattern as such. The authors have clearly stated the proposed changes though. they could have added uml and crc cards.
1,"The document is really descriptive about what work needs to be done. However, I would suggest them to properly structure the document. One finds it really difficult to understand the flow of the document."
1,The bar charts have been added to the design report. The visualizations have been added to views also and the screen shots have been added too. The only thing that I would like to add is that the bar charts could have been more descriptive. As in they could have added details for� x label and y label and also put legend. this will aid the user in quickly understanding what the chart is conveying.�
1,"The document does include a flowchart which shows the flow of changes. However, an UML diagram would have made the document more understandable and easy to follow."
1,"The test plan section is included, however, only the framework to be used is discussed. I would suggest them to include a little more brief description about what test cases they plan to include and work on."
1,The authors have described the changes to be made. However these are very abstract and require some technical depth
1,The changes necessary are explicitly outlined. though more description as to why certain files need to be modified would be nice to have.
1,"As said in the previous review, though the UI mockup explains the functionalities, it could have been more legible."
1,Test plan is discussed in the write up. It could have been supported with some use-cases.
1,"Yes the design is sound and appeopriate. However, it may be better to implement more code level design."
1,"The test plan is completed. Just one suggestion that it can be more specific. For example, it may include some real test cases."
1,1) Create class diagram and UML diagram outlining the set of actions that the reviewer and the author can perform.
1,1) Document includes test plan. 2) However can include more test cases.
1,Content is good and well written from the last review I was expecting little more in depth�deatails�on the implementation side .�I see no edits after Nov 14 except for the new image
1,Diagram included in the implementation plan is confusing. A better way would have been to include a diagram to indicate the step by step flow.
1,"The UI mockups are good. I'm not entirely sure that the UML diagram is effective, perhaps a better diagram style would work better."
1,Several tests are listed and described. I would suggest adding more details for each test as there is some vagueness as to what each described action entails.�
1,�The design appears to be well made. However due to lack of more detail I am unable to judge it correctly. What changes need to be made in the files is not mentioned.
1,"�Yes the design is simple, however, as stated above it is very succinct and abstract.� Only which files are going to be edited are written. What methods/interfaces will be modified is not mentioned."
1,�The diagrams have been enlarged and are now visible. Good improvement. However I still feel that computer made mockups would have looked cleaner.
1,�Yes the design includes a test plan in the end. This too is very abstract (about 5 lines total) and just states the use cases. Tip: use the 'it should' format or at least describe the simple manual testing that can be done.
1,"They have a UML diagram which pretty much does it job. I am not in favor of the UI mockups they have put. They could have used any software for the same, which would have made it legible."
1,"UI mockups and UML diagrams are descriptive. However, more information should be conveyed to how to solve the problem"
1,Test Plan too brief. Could add scenarios and description.�
1,Even though few test cases have been provided I feel like it could have been more detailed with the steps�involved in the testing.
1,"The issues have been identified and documented clearly.�However, a little more of explanation is required for the�solutions proposed for issues 2 - 5. They seem to me at a very high level."
1,"Yes, the authors have nicely explained the changes to be made. This includes, the flow diagrams, UML diagrams and many of the screenshots. Good work team. Suggestion: Could include screenshots, if any, of the test plans implemented."
1,"The author has very well given a background of the system and the problem, which forms a lucid idea of the changes intended by the author in the system. However, the author has only given a very high level view of the changes to be incorporated in the system. There is not much of an explanation, nor an implementation."
1,"Yes, they have been thorough in their approach and this has been a project implemented to perfection. They have not only given proper UML diagrams and the like, but they are yet to implement the code and showcase in the ""UML Diagram for Review"" section.� � �"
1,"The problems are described very nicely. When it comes to changes to be made, files to be modified are given. I feel more explanation needs to be given with respect to changes in these files for each problem stating why this file needs to be changed and what the impact will be."
1,The doc is very well written. Its like a blueprint to the project. Really appreciate the team efforts!
1,Team have explained the Problem/Steps to Reproduce are really very clear. Solution part could have been explained better. Overall its a good work
1,"The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The wiki has complete details related to requirements , analysis of current designs and changes required to achieve the required functionality. overall great job !� The team did a great work in analyzing the issues and designing solutions for the issues. The UI mock ups are included for all the issues which makes the document very easy to understand.��"
1,Mostly�yes. But the working flow could have been explained better with the flow diagrams.
1,Given UML diagram which�are explaining the functionality appropriately�but class diagram would have been better to explain the detail code level change�
1,There are some test plans in place and others will be done after the bugs are generated. Suggestions: It would have been great to have screenshots of the test plans.
1,"The author has made a test plan, but it is ""reactive"" instead of ""proactive"". The test plan for the changes to be incorporated could be improved a bit further by further consideration about the usage scenario."
1,"Make include more details for test plan, other than that, the wiki looks very good."
1,Tests are given at a very high level and need to be described properly.
1,"The team has included the test plan design but the documentation is missing on the scenarios that will be tested after the implementation, How the team will be testing it , what are the automated test that will be created and also the manual test plan. How an end user can test the end-to- end requirements should also be a part of the design."
1,Test plans are present but have not explained in detail. A brief description� of the use case with the test plan and RSpec would be perfect�
1,Documentation can be improved. Include more details about the controllers method team is planning to change/add.
1,"design looks clear, just need to add what files will be added, and what files will be modified to make the design more sound."
1,"Yes, it seems very sound. They list what they are going to do in 4 fields."
1,"Yes, it seems like sound, however, the authors could add some principles and patterns into it."
1,"Maybe add a class diagram, but newly added flowchart and database diagram make the design more clear."
1,The team have done a good job explaining their project. But I feel the team should have detailed their explanation of the implementation more. Also the test cases should have been included in more detail.
1,"Overall, the report was concise and fairly clear about what changes were being made to the system. However, the need for the Rails Internationalization API in addition to the Google's Cloud Translation API was not explained. Also, the report mentioned that strings in the actual code were not changing, which should have been explained in more detail."
1,"The changes are clearly mentioned , they are very clear what and where to make changes. Only suggestion would be to include more about how these changes are going to be done.�"
1,"Yes authors have done well to explain the changes being done in the project. I think I wish they would have added is the details of languages they are supporting.� �Also they do mention that they will add extra column to languages table, they could have pasted the new schema in the doc"
1,No design found on the wiki. Not sure if any design diagram is needed but a flow diagram to test the changes can be helpful.
1,"The design is quite good. It clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. However, the only suggestion would be to include more UML diagrams so that the design becomes more clear and understandable."
1,Design looks good at high level though specific details about implementation are still missing. I would expect that here.� they also state that they are using google translate details on what api they will be using would have been helpful
1,"The design is simple- the authors have discussed the changes like allowing instructor to change language of a course and adding multi-language support in the design. One suggestion is that the authors could have described the difference between static and dynamic strings used in this context. Especially since they specify that only static strings will be translated, but dynamic strings will remain in English."
1,The authors have explained well regarding their design approach to�support Hindi language but it has not mentioned if their design is flexible enough to add another languages in the future. I think they can mention if their design can accomodate other languages easily or not.
1,"The explanations are more than sufficient. Not only have the authors explained the changes to the system, but also explained the reasoning for considering those changes. I like the way that they also explained the other different ways they could've integrated the GitHub metrics but avoided those methods with sufficient reasoning for the same.The team has also given an explanation of their database design modifications would be like which is good."
1,Yes. The team intends to use grade_controller to show github metric which would be a good place to implement this functionality. The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests.�
1,"Yes, they included some design principles, which is good. Maybe the authors could add some design patterns into wiki."
1,Maybe add some design diagrams rather than just have screenshots.
1,"The design appears to be sound for most part of it. The linking between the different sections seems appropriate. The only issue I have is with the mock-up in the Design Details -> Second Change mock-up number 2. I think that the bar chart is being displayed for each and every day. I feel that is not only highly unnecessary but also would be very overwhelming for the instructor to process all this information because:-i) It is common knowledge that many students do not begin projects until a few days/weeks would have passed since the assignment is posted. So that would leave the initial few days of the bar chart empty with nothing valuable to show.ii) The duration of each project varies from project to project. Assignment 2 had a duration of about 20 -30 days. This would mean that there would be about 20 bar charts for each day which would be quite difficult for the TA/instructor to process for just one team let alone for so many other teams they need to evaluate. Suggestions: Instead of providing bar chart for each day aggregate it to a bar chart for each week or one in 5 days. And then maybe towards the deadline or like a week before the deadline you could switch to 1 barchart per day. OR Provide an option to switch between the scaling of time periods like a week, 5 days, 1 day etc."
1,"Yes, the github api integration looks good. the only part missing was perhaps they could have documented the rest calls that they are going to make in the document as well. Usage of existing gems is good and eases lot of implementation pains �"
1,There were mock-ups of the final result of the project however there were no UML diagrams. I think the UML diagrams are not necessary for this project since the flow of how the instructor will change the language is fairly simple and one can understand it by just reading the document. Maybe they could have done a mock-up of how some of the other views would have looked like once the language has changed. Especially the pages with flash messages if any. Currently they have just shown the proposed changes on the page where the instructor will change the language.
1,The idea to involve instructors because of a 60 requests/hour limit may complicate the project. Another idea would be to update metrics with a round robin scheduling of GET requests.�
1,"Though this project doesn't require any UML diagram as such. However, a flowchart showing the work flow would have made the design document better and efficient."
1,"The screenshots for the view are great, they help in understanding the problem statement and the solution. however the design document lacks use case or class diagrams on how extenral entity interacts with the system and gets response.� Since the authors are using external api's it would have been good if they could give more details request and response�"
1,1) Have clearly mentioned when will GitHub Api be hit to retrive the data and which gem will be used.
1,"Yes, the authors are using already existing gems for the implementation. I would have liked to see a section on caching if any.� Rest the solution proposed looks simple and straightforward and looks that it will easily integrate into the current system �"
1,The team have written a test plan. But I feel more test cases could have been written to test the edge cases. Also the team could have explained their test cases in more detail.
1,"The test plan is clear and effective but shallow. Manual testing is good, but more description should be provided for the automated testing."
1,As there are UI changes test plan is not required but a basic stepwise description of how to see the required output can be helpful
1,Use case diagram is present but it would have been nice to see a sequence diagram to understand the flow.�
1,The design includes a brief test plan that lists three scenarios namely- the regular steps to update Course page to Hindi; checking if Edit Assignment page has also been translated and checking if other pages are translated. Some more test cases like checking if the change in language is reflected from a student login could have been included. The authors specify that Rspec and Capybara is used for testing the new feature.
1,"The use case diagram appears to be slightly incorrect. The symbol for an should be a stick figure not a rectangle. But that is a minor error. Also, the Use Case Diagram Details mention student as an actor but the diagram shows no instance of student as an actor. I think the Student as an actor shouldn't be included because in the current use case only the instructor is the primary actor and the assignment should have been submitted by the time the instructor views the scores, thus, requiring no involvement from the students at that point in time.Mention of Primary sequence in the Use Case Diagram Details seems highly unnecessary and potentially unrelated."
1,There are enough aids such as uml diagrams and screen shots. The authors explicitly mention that there are no db changes so no need of an er diagram. Although I would have liked some class level details to be mentioned in the document that would help to dig more about the design changes
1,The test plan briefly mentions the scenarios the team plans to test. They can add more about the test cases if possible.
1,The test plan does include a high level of testing scenarios the team plans to cover. I would suggest the team should add BDD tests so they can test the same after the development phase is over.
1,"The test plan seems adequate at this stage, edge cases may need to be considered at a later stage."
1,few more test cases can be added
1,Few test plan is written. The team can add more test plan.
1,Good test plan. Should include more test cases that check the functionality of GitHub integration. eg: If number of lines of code committed by a student is correctly computed.
1,The design includes a test plan. However the test plan has nothing related to tests or which test cases are going to be considered. It just explains the flow of how an instructor would reach the GitHub metrics data page.The team should at least mention which files are the test cases going to be written on and what functionalities are they going to test.
1,"The background is clear and thorough but the explanation of the changes to be made to the system lack detail. Terms such as DOM, the Blob APi, and ECMAScript were not explained."
1,I am giving this a zero because of concerns of plagiarism. Your page has multiple sections that are direct copy pastes of the wiki that you linked to. You either need to write something original or site that this is not your work. Consider having a shorter summary of these sections and link to the other wiki for greater background as you have already done.
1,"The page feel more like a project report instead of wiki page. They should not tell people to ""go through the following page"", instead they should just tell, ""the page"" is previous work."
1,"They list the files to be changed for the final stage of the project, but the description of what will be changed is still lacking. I'd love to see screenshots of added code, or an explanation of what is and is not needed."
1,The document clearly mentions the requirement of the project with the problem statement.
1,Authors have clearly explained what needs to be done and how it would be done.
1,"Yes, the authors have specified the changes that have already been implemented as a part of the OSS project and the proposed set of changes that are to be implemented as a part of the final project. Detailed information on the changes already made is available as a Wiki link to the previous document. This document clearly captures the implementation of the OffScreenCanvas Webidl and Rust files. The design document attached in this round encompasses the proposed design of- implementation of the OffScreenCanvasRenderingContext2D and enabling of the blob API for testing the code. The authors have also listed the files changed and to be changed, making it easier for the reviewers to keep track of the code on Github. Though the text is lucid, lack of a visual tool- (like flow charts, tables or UML diagrams) to concisely illustrate the workflow might make it difficult for new readers to follow the functionalities proposed and the interlinking of various modules. So, one suggestion at this point is that the authors could have included a visual representation of the design. Apart from that, the document is well made and credits to the team."
1,The authors have adequately explained the changes made to the system. Ot would have been better if some visual modes are added.
1,"The authors do a great job of explaining the technical details and the api functionality of the requirements. Furthermore, they provide a list of files that are going to be changed in the scope of this project. However, the document would be more complete if the authors provided more details about specifics of changes. For example the description of high level changes pertaining to the OffscreenCanvasContextRendering2D is adequate, but it would be better if the authors elaborated on the code that is going to be filtered out."
1,"Duplicating code and fixing it for the new implementation is an effective strategy but not very DRY and could result in code that is hard to maintain, read, and test."
1,"There is less about what they gonna do, but more about ""before and after part"""
1,need to include a flow diagram
1,"The design sounds good, but that's largely due to how vague it is: naturally we want to add the things we need to add, and remove the things we need to remove."
1,The authors have not mentioned the name of the design pattern used but have mentioned the steps for implementation.
1,The high level view of the solution appears to be reasonable. The problem with this design is that there is no discussion present about any principles or patterns that are going to be utilized as part of the solution. I would suggest using certain keywords to make the decisions more clear to the reader. For example the authors talk about reusing the code of HTMLCanvasContextRendering2D and WebGLRenderingContext. It would be helpful if the concrete mechanism were specified. For example patterns like Decorator or Adapter would be relevant for this case.
1,not very well. lack of the use case.
1,"The design feels simple and not much different from the one I saw in Round 1, in my perspective because I have already reviewed the project in the previous round. But, to a new reviewer it might not be that direct at first as they need to understand the base of the project and the first phase of implementation which is covered in the wiki document of the previous project."
1,"The main thread behind the design seems to be reusing the existing code which provides the similar functionality. This is a great idea. It is consistent with the appropriate programming principles e.g. not reinventing the wheel. One suggestion would be for the authors to explain why the instance of the class, from which the relevant parts of code are going to be copied, is not directly used as�this would be a more DRY approach. In a case if this is not possible, then providing a proper reasoning and justification would be helpful."
1,"Though the team have explained their work pretty well, the team should think about adding a few diagrams to better help in the understanding of the project. Currently the team have not used any diagrams."
1,It would be nice to see a mockup of the off-screen canvas.
1,A suggestion would be to add some visualization about what the offscreenCanvas does would be helpful.
1,Still no visualizations of any kind
1,The design does not include any kind of diagram. It would have been better if a flowchart or a class diagram could have been included in the document.
1,"The current document does not include a visualization tool- inclusion of such a tool would have made the document more readable.� Nevertheless the link to the Wiki of the previous document includes a flow diagram that clearly outlines the code flow of how the control flows from the incorporation of OffScreenCanvas web IDL file to its Rust implementation in OffScreenCanvas.rs, to the DOM implementation and finally to the renderer.�"
1,It would have been better if some screenshots and UML diagrams was added to the design doc to better explain the functionality.
1,There are no diagrams present in the document. While the diagrams for apis and class interactions may have been helpful they are not necessary for this project as the authors provide a detailed explanation of the relevant functionalities.
1,"hough the team have explained their work pretty�well, the have not included a test plan. It is an important part of the project and should be included"
1,"The test plan is clear but shallow. Finer grain tests should be described, not simply functional tests."
1,No there is no test plan
1,It would have been better if a test plan covering changes made to the system was added to the design doc.
1,"The test plan is not included in the design document. While the instances of testing�are certainly mentioned, e.g. ""specific functionalities could be tested by writing a custom html file and then running it the similar way."" and ""Finally, we�ll test our code by enabling the blob API."" the authors do not provide an extensive discussion of specifically what functionality is going to be tested."
1,"Yes, this is the best design I have reviewed. It has clearly explained the changes in steps. the formatting is great, and it's very well made with very good design details and objectives. It also included the current scenario and a typical score table. It should be great if there's an expected final outcome visualization as well."
1,authors adequately explained the changes to be made to the system but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to be implemented to achieve the goal.  �
1,"The explanation is inadequate, needs more textual explanation of the problem and approach"
1,"Team did not explained project well with the description. Diagrams do explain the approach, but for a reader to get the overview but text description is also important. Team can work on adding text description. Same had been suggested in the last review.��"
1,Just a small explanation of the proposed solution has been given. They could clearly explained more.
1,"The authors used a lot of charts for use cases, this is great, but they only explained a little for implementation, which could be explained in a great detail."
1,"The design is clear at a high level but lacks detail. The report described what the project is, but�how�will this feature be implemented?"
1,"The authors have provided use cases for creating new�subclass of Questionnaire,�SupplementaryReviewQuestionnaire. However, more details can be added to the implementation section such as what new methods will be doing and test plans."
1,The team has included all the details required to implement the given requirement. The documents lacks the changes the changes that will be made to the system and also the design of the changes. the document just included the list of files that will be changes to achieve the desired result.
1,"Yes, it has the implementation plan of a checkbox, which allows the instructor to decide about review times. Since that is the only thing to be implemented, there's no more issues. I think the diagram doesn't have very pretty look, it should be better if the screenshot can be smaller so that the fonts in the diagrams can be seen more clearly."
1,Authors have given a brief description of the subclass of Questionnaire named SupplementaryReviewQuestionnaire that they are going to implement but it would have been better if they have provided how and what model dependency needs to implemented to achieve the goal.
1,The explanation is adequate. I would suggest that the design of the doc be more explicit. It may include some sub titles and the font shoule be of different sizes to emphasize some parts.
1,"The authors gave enough explanations about the design for the UI parts. That is, �how will they design the UI and handle the problems related to UI, but they didn't give the design for how will they deal with the reviews differently when instructors check or uncheck the box. I cannot identify how can they check if the box is checked in the code, and how can they according to the status of the box to make sure the students can only update the previous reviews when the box is unchecked and students can require new reviews when the box is checked."
1,"The authors have still only mentioned the UI side changes, i.e. adding a checkbox to control the functionality. They have not thought about the actual logic to limit the students from seeing the reviews. Please include this in the design as this completes the entire functionality.�"
1,"The authors have explained the scope of the project pretty well. But as I mentioned in the earlier review, a whole paragraph on the background of expertiza�is not required, one or two sentences would have sufficed."
1,"The design appears appropriate, but since it is shallow, it is hard to tell how sound it is. How will a user be prevented from requesting another review? Also, the naming seems to assume either one or two rounds. What about more than two rounds?"
1,"The design seems good. However, it would be better if the author can mention the design principles and patterns followed in the documentation."
1,Design plan has not changed since I last reviewed. A bit more detail would still be nice
1,Design doc does not explain the approach to resolve the issue to be taken well. As i could see only 2 lines of explanation. Team should explain the design more clearly for naive users too. Team has not used any design principle.
1,"The design lacked enough explanation about how will they deal with reviews when the box is �checked and unchecked. For the naming of the function and database, the name seems too long. It is better to make the name shorter and easy to understand."
1,The team has submitted a partial design and the part they have thought about is complete. The rest has not been thought through. Please consider the design for the logic necessary to show/hide the reviews for the students.
1,"Yes, the design is simple. The design includes details in checking rounds: when it's bigger than or equal to 2, add the checkbox and otherwise do nothing. However, I doubt if that's needed in design document. Since in the future if we need to do 3-round reviews, this 2 feature can be misleading."
1,"It looks like sound, but I think the authors could add some principles and patterns which they may use into wiki."
1,"Team has added a flow diagram and system screenshots. Team could added UML diagrams, so as to understand sequence of events or actors involved."
1,"There's only one diagram, from the perspective of the user, in terms of how the functionality should be like. It does clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. It should be better if there's another diagram, which explains the work flow, in terms of which files we need to do at each step, and what we need to do one step after another to implement the project. �"
1,The flowchart included concisely explains the functionality they plan to add. Suggestion: Add UML diagrams for Use case or sequence diagrams to explain their implementation design. This will make the design planned easier to follow. �
1,They had 2 diagrams. One for UI and one for the implementation. The implementation can me less words and more simple.
1,The team has not used many diagrams to explain the changes made in the project. They have just�explained using a simplified�flowchart. No Use case or ER diagrams have been used to explain the changes made.
1,"The manual tests listed should adequately test the functionality, but information should be provided on automated testing."
1,"Team has not mentioned test cases that they are going to write. Manual testing steps are mentioned. Team should work on adding test cases, as manual test does not help to check� all the corners of the complex system well."
1,"There's a test� plan. The test plan is deep and indeed tests the functionality. It should be better if the test plan also includes another step between 4 and 5, in terms of how to make the step ""student can(or cannot) do the second review without the first one""."
1,"The team has explained the manual testing process. suggestion : include how the ""Go"" functionality is actually tested in ruby . Include edge cases for the testing functionality."
1,"The team has written steps that are required to test the system. However, they could improve this by adding test code that would test the basic functionality."
1,Manual test plan as of now. Try to automate it if possible.
1,All the tests have not been implemented. but the test plan has been described. Could have included more test cases to extensively�test the system. Automated test could have been written.
1,"The test plan is not adequate enough and a little bit ambiguous. For the checkbox part, there are many cases not included. For example, the checkbox is unchecked by default, in different cases, the checkbox will show or not. For the student side, 5 for each case is not clear enough and I cannot identify what the anticipated results for these cases should be."
1,Design concept seems promising but a brief introduction about how each module will be implemented for both reviewer and reviewee is missing.�
1,The design seems simple but it is unclear on the implementation section. The authors can add more on how they plan to add new code or modify existing implementations�to achieve their goal.
1,The design is simple and easy to understand. Could be better if implementing some code level design.
1,The use case diagrams are understandable but I think images of web pages will make things more clear.
1,The team has include the use case diagrams for all the scenarios related to the requirement. Some UI mockups would have helped othwewise great work.
1,UML and Class diagram are needed.� If the screenshot of the same functionality was given then it would have been�better.
1,Please add a test plan to the documentation in order�to make sure that the test plan is covering the code changes.
1,"No. Team did not mentioned anything under Test Plan.Team�should work�on this part of project as well, as manual testing will not help to check all the corners of the complex project."
1,"There is only a title for test plan, which could be in a great detail."
1,The team included a test plan section is the documentation which is currently blank. the team should include the automated and manual test scenarios in the document.
1,The test plan section included in the design document does not provide any content. It could specify the various scenarios considered and describe how each functionality could be tested.
1,"There is no test plan included in the design document. Actually, there should be a lot of tests need to be done for this project. From the UI, controller to model, the project should include test plan cover all these aspects to make sure the function can work as intended."
1,"The complexity is again a big unknown to me, as they have kept the algorithm as a black box. It is unclear where the algorithm changes are to be implemented, if it is in a controller, and if yes, in which controller. I suggest the authors to provide internal details of the algorithm in order to understand their proposed solution better. As of now, I am clear about their input and output formats, however I would like to know which functions do they interface with."
1,"There were mock-ups of how the Analyze button would be displayed along side each rubric, however there is no mock-up for how the response would be displayed.Suggestions: I would like to see where and how would that response be displayed because from the flow diagram the response seems to be quite big. I would like to also know if the team is planing to display all the components of the response from the API or just a few."
1,"The visualization includes a screen mock-up ""Analyze""� button which will implement the algorithm and produce the output. However, there is no mock-up of the screen of what will the output be like. The flow diagram is highly redundant according to me, as it does not portray any additional information about the design. I would suggest them to provide a sequence diagram of the algorithm methods, so as to illustrate their changes."
1,I think more tests can be added
1,The team has included test plan in Connextra format by including the feature specification and two scenarios- one happy path and one to capture the edge case of response generated with no text. No more test cases can be added to check if the team's part in the project is implemented well. Some test case scenarios that check the efficiency of the suggestion detection algorithm (for example: to detect review responses that generate the generalized suggestion for all the projects) can be included.
1,"The design document has incorporated test plans, but they haven't been explained neatly. Only the skeleton for the tests has been provided, they've should have at least�added one actual test code for the�reviewer to verify."
1,"Their test plan includes a test case for successfully displaying the pop-up text message as JSON, and�displaying suggestion metrics for the review segment( a block of review, a comment box). Try to include test cases where a review message is absent, i.e. the code should not break for empty review segment. Include a test case where review segment has a suggestion, and test if the output says ""Suggestion present"". Include a negative test case for the the suggestion, where a suggestion is not given by the reviewer, and test that the output says ""suggestion absent""."
1,"I am not convinced with the ""similar_assignments"" table schema. For an assignment Ax, there is a foreign key that points to an assignment Ay such that Ax can be an assignment in say 2018 and Ay can be the same assignment in 2017. But what if one of the reviews from assignment Az which was in 2015 was really good and we need to include that as a sample and also include another review from Aw from 2016 as a sample.� According my understanding, this above requirement cannot be met with the current DB table design. Something that the team may look into."
1,There is one box for both review controller and assignment controller. A better picture of how they handle each event differently would have been helpful.
1,"The test plan gives a black box testing view which is good and easy to understand. But it would be helpful to give more details about what functionalities are tested. Like a new DB table is added. So tests related to that and corner cases such as an old assignment gets removed , foreign key constraint so how will that test be conducted would make it better."
1,"The Use Case diagram added is drawn well and helps explaining the system. Team could have added, screenshots of the Expertiza pages, that would have helped us understand whoch part of the system is changing well."
1,Team has added manual testing under test plan. Team should also add automated test cases or brief plan on how they are going forward with automated testing of the changes.
1,"The team has represented the workflow through the UML diagrams which is very helpful to understand the flow of the requirement with multiple actors involved in the system. However, it would have been more helpful if they could add the design flow diagrams to explain the database design changes they are suggesting to be done. The new table they are suggesting to make and� the fields they would map to could be shown through a entity relationship diagram which will make it easy for the end user to understand the attributes and the relationship of different entities involved due to the functionality change."
1,"I like the Use Case Diagram, but I would like class diagrams or a database visualization too, so it's easier to understand how the cross-course assignment linking will work."
1,some mock UI where this is going to be implemented would be helpful
1,"The overall design looks good.�However, the author can add more details about the design principles being followed and appropriate patterns to be used."
1,"The Test plan seems to be covering most of the positive test cases. However, it doesn't seem to cover any negative test cases. Like if the student decides not to make the review public, its reviews shouldn't be shown to the TA/ Instructor."
1,Yes the Problem Statement and Design Approach sections explain clearly what the usecase is and what the authors think will be a good design to implement.The changes are clearly explained. Having some file names would be useful to review in detail.
1,The usecase diagram is helpful but does not help much as it just explains what is provided in the approach section. More in-depth functionality of what each user will do or how will the design flow (flow chart) would be more helpful.
1,Test Plan is explained in detail. It covers Integration Testing and Functional checks. However some unit testing of the new models should also be covered.
1,"The authors have described 1-2 solutions of the problem. However, I would suggest them to include more about how these changes will be done and where are these changes going to occur, what files will be affected etc."
1,"I can't find any explanation for principles and patterns, maybe the authors should add them to wiki."
1,"Yes, the design seems appropriate and suitable for the case. Maybe the author could specify the patterns they use in the document."
1,The design is both simple and clear. It should be better to add another step for the comparison of the instructor review and the student review. Both as a final examination and a testing.
1,"Yes the design is as simple as possible. However they have only described the proposed design. They could have provided simple mock ups or samples,"
1,"The document is well explained. Thus, it reduces complexity and makes itself appear quite easy for the user to understand. However, more diagrams and flowcharts would have helped even more."
1,"The diagram only stated the current scenario..�There's no final picture, no UML diagram. The figure didn't clearly describe the changes to be made to the system. It should be better if there's a UML diagram from the user practice side, a diagram for the design plan, and also another figure for the final picture: how dows it look like when the plan is implemented."
1,"No, the proposed UI changes are only mentioned and the diagrams in the wiki are of the current system. Use draw.io for mockups and drawings."
1,Team has used screenshots to show the current scenario but any flowcharts/UML to describe how they are solving the problem is missing. Adding these will make the document easier for anyone not familiar the project understand it better
1,There are no UML diagrams. I would suggest them to include a test case diagram that can improve understandability.
1,The testing appears to be pretty rigorous. They have taken into account cases when TA/instructor's scores should be excluded. The test cases could have been better described.
1,Team has done a good job in identifying the cases that needs to be tested. It will be an improvement if they can add details on how they plan to test each controller/view separately.
1,"The test plan is shallow. It only state what features the team will test but how the features will be test, what and how many cases will be included are not clear. The team should expand the plan for each features they aim to test, including specific steps and different cases."
1,"Both the problems and proposed changes are clearly detailed. My only suggestion is to put the description of the issue being solved in the same location as the solution to it, otherwise one has to scroll around the page to figure out which problem is being fixed."
1,design is fine. some minor errors like no stop phase.Moreover no design patterns used. Just flowcharts are provided.If some sequence diagram or use case diagrams were provided it would improve the design a lot.
1,Yes the design is pretty good. The patterns followed avoids any duplication of code. But I had made a suggestion in Review One to take a look at Project 1843 and it's code. The problem statement is quite similar and the code could be reused. I don't see any mention of it. I hope you do take a look before starting to code as it will avoid any re-work.
1,Design is informative. But too detailed. One UML would have been apt.
1,The team has discussed their plan using flowcharts. But they have not used any class diagram.
1,"Yes the design includes the test plan. However, the test plan could have been more low level, instead of just writing 'it should' statements."
1,A through test-plan is described. I do think Test Case-2 could be described more efficiently so that it is clear and easy to understand. Overall looks good.
1,The wiki could have been organized better. It looks a little messy. Not self explanatory. The Use case does not have any actors in it. Suggestion: Code screenshots could have been placed better
1,The files to be changed have been properly listed. I feel more explanation ought be given as to why these files have been modified and in what way.
1,Less explanation on problem statement. Could have elaborated on the problem scenario and why changes needs to be made.
1,"The design looks fine,�team has provided the initial test plans. A Lo-fi sketch is available as well. The team could have put git links to the test plan code for better organization."
1,"The authors have explained well on what changes they want to make but it is unclear how it will be implemented. As I had suggested in my previous review, they can mention the expertiza files (controllers, views) involved.�"
1,Design is too detailed. I would suggest keeping it short and precise.
1,There is just one flow diagram which does explain the activities to happen. There is no use case diagram with actors and all the uses cases expected. Suggestion: The use case diagram would have given better clarity about the system
1,The design does include enough test plans. The team has provided the code screenshots for the same. Suggestion: Could have put links to the git code so that the wiki could have been short and precise.
1,"The project consists of five independent problems the scope of which is well-defined in the design document. The team provides visual diagrams in the solution descriptions which further improve the explanations of changes. The fix for the Issue #1008 - ""Issue related to staggered deadline"" is backed up by a discussion about relevant db tables and corresponding part of code. One minor improvement would be for the authors to highlight the specific parts of code that are going to be changed in the updated block of code. Moreover, the solution to the Issue #1072 - ""Issue related to instructor's assignment participation"" is not specific enough, i.e. it is not clear which structures are going to be affected by the changes. All in all, the document does a great job in explaining what changes are going to be introduced in the system."
1,flowcharts are simple to understand but no design patterns used.some supporting class diagrams or sequence diagrams would be helpful.
1,You can add some more explaination of what exactly you'll do in issues like:� Issue #1072 - Issue related to instructor's assignment participation. I felt information is missing here.
1,Fixes are simple adjustments to the current code. The last issue requires an addition of a full function but I think that it is appropriate to handle the bug fix as it pulls that responsibility out and keeps things nicely�separated and associated�for purpose.
1,�Yes the design is simple in nature and easy to understand. This can be attributed to the fact that their issues are quite simple in nature. They could have provided some simple UI mockups of the changes.
1,For each problem the authors display relevant chunks of code and discuss which parts need to be changed. Aside from the Issue #1072 all the solutions seem reasonable and simple. One minor suggestion for improvement would be to use the .collect instead of the .each method for computing total_weight in validate_assignment_questionnaires_weights method.
1,�The visualization provided in the form of flow diagrams in very easy to understand. However ER diagrams of main DB tables could have been provided because it is difficult to understand the data flow and inter relation between tables.
1,"Could have included some screenshots. Otherwise, great work by the team on UML diagrams."
1,"The test plan section defines the steps needed to manually test the functionalities, but I would suggest the team to also include the logic they propose to use in the rspec tests, the objects they would mock etc."
1,"Test plan is included, but it makes many references to manual tests. The tests they state could be automated in a straight forward manner."
1,"The test plan is present. It is broken down into separate sections for each of the five issues. Each section is further broken down into a manual and automated testing parts. While the sections for manual testing are comprehensive, the sections for automated tests are too general and do not provide a clear vision for what types of changes are going to be introduced. I would suggest elaborating more on the technical side of the tests, for example specifying which spec files will be modified or whether or not the project will utilize RSpec."
1,"Yes, the changes to be made are nicely explain. The diagrams and screenshots are in place. Suggestion: There was more scope to the test plans"
1,The design doc explains the project in detail. I would suggest that the description could be�modified by removing redundancy to make the doc more succinct. Also what MVC files are being touched could have been mentioned.
1,"The design does appear to be sound. The team has put most of the use cases, actors and explained them well. The screenshots of the UI are also present. Suggestion: Could have explained the implementation a bit more in bullet points."
1,Yes the team seem to have a clear idea as to what must be done and how the result must look. It would be helpful if the team gave some insights as to how the composite score formula was decided as this is the heart of the project.
1,The UML diagrams are�detailed and explained well. Suggestion: The application flow could be explained in points so that the reviewer has a clearer view of what is the sequence of events occurring.
1,The team has an outline of the test plan and the test scenarios which they are planning to take care of. It would be suggested that the team takes care of all the exhaustive scenarios which are related to the functionality. They could also add the step wise description of the scenarios they have mentioned or the test cases they are planning to implement. Test driven approach makes sure our code is exhaustive of all scenarios.
1,The test plan can be more elaborate and complete. This will help as part of the behaviour driven design process and also help you test whether every change made works correctly.
1,The design has been listed with a few test plans. I feel that there could be more tests included. Suggestion: Test plans need to be explained more and could provide the code if TDD approach is used.
1,Yes the test plan is included but the test plan appears to be very shallow as it gives the which functionalities must be test but doesn't mentions it inform of test like what should be the actions taken when a certain condition arises it can be more clearly stated by mentioning the test cases in form of context and it statements
1,Test plan is very shallow. Only the headings are mentioned. A proper description of what is the test for and what to expect from each test will be helpful in understanding.
1,The current tests written are good but it would be good if the team had pointed out the corner cases as wel such as - what happens if the deadline for self-review is exceeded? Does that mean the peer-review scores cannot be seen? Or is a default score of 0 is set?
1,"They have a paragraph saying what they are going to do, but it could be broken up into parts with images for better understanding"
1,They have one scenario. maybe a few more could help better test their work
1,"Yes, the proposed solutions part clearly stated that they will go through each review to compare the new review score, etc, and then they will store the review URL. However, the solution is not concrete enough and is a little bit hard to follow. It should be great if there's more details in stating about how to loop through each reviews. �"
1,"The design is sound because it follows the problem statement and the instructions. I doubt if it follows the DRY principle while looping through each review, because that might be already done in the Expertiza. In terms of patterns, I think here it needs to use the factory pattern, altough it's not stated in the design."
1,"The design is simple, although it could be better if it has more concrete examples."
1,"There are a lot of diagrams, but the application flow and the UML Diagram doesn't look very clear. We can hardly see the words in the UML Diagram. Also, the diagrams seem to not fit each other. How does the application diagram and the Uml diagram connect to each other? There's no clear instructions. Also, I don't think a screen shot of code in the design doc is a good idea. I think it could be better if the changes expected to be made can be described in a more abstract fashion.�"
1,"There's a testing plan. Although the testing plan seems to cover the fuctionalities, it is not clearly stated. The tester should log in as what role? how to select a teams assignment and review it? How to log out and check the instructor's email? which instructor email should the tester check? These questions should have been answered in the test plan."
1,"The design document contains all the necessary sections but fails to provide adequate explanation of the changes to be made. The authors have done a good job at explaining the current scenario, also identified the code where the changes are to be made. They have identified the need of a new function and its purpose, but fail to provide a design of the intended changes, i.e. new functions or modifications in the functions, any need to use different variables etc. The authors have not added any changes relevant to the previous suggestions."
1,"As they have provided a very high-level idea of their proposed solution, there is no pseudocode or any class diagram which helps explain the design adequately. You can improvise the design by including flow of the methods, to highlight how and where will your new method come into picture. However, looking at the intended modifications, it seems that the changes follow DRY principles, and changes are not unnecessary. There is also no need of using any design patterns as per the required changes."
1,"The design does appear to be simple, as they have not planned to modify any of the existing methods. Their new method will interact with�Response, AssignmentQuestionnaire model, and then link the assignment to the review in the email. However, they have not mentioned if they have planned any data structure/variable to store the assignment link and pass it on to the method where email notification will be sent. But, i suppose that storing it in a variable will suffice.�"
1,"The visualization aids used currently are application flow diagram, and use cases. They are useful to understand the scenario of the problem statement. However, a sequence or a communication diagram will really be beneficial to understand how the method interfaces with the other� methods. This will help identify if the new method impacts other functionalities and will portray the proposed solution efficiently."
1,"I think that there is a huge scope for test plan improvisation. The current test plan is just a step-by-step procedure to test if the reviewer receives a mail fir conflicting reviews. The test plan should also include test cases to test whether the link is present in the email notification. Also, is the link correct and navigable? The test plan should also cover the pits where the functionality may fail, so as to ensure smooth functioning of the system."
1,"Design does seem to be sound, but complex. As mentioned in the earlier review, I am unsure if looping over each review is the correct thing to do or not. Maybe the team discussed this with the mentor and decided against it as no new information has been added in the document. If so, I would only suggest the team to include the complexity of the design in the�document."
1,"The test plan section unfortunately lists no concrete test that the team would write. Checking the functionality manually, and writing rspec tests for the code written are extremely different, and I would suggest the team to have a dedicated test plan section, mentioning the controller/model they wish to test, the objects they would need to mock etc."
1,some additional tests can be added
1,"They used the UML diagrams, it really help me a lot when reading the wiki page. Maybe they can also make diagrams about the changes they are going to make."
1,They did include a test plan. It would be better if they also test the instructor side.
1,Author could have provided the design pattern they need to implement.
1,The test plan seems overly simplistic. It only tests whether the team's changes work in the most drastic scenario possible. It seems like they should have more boundary value tests and more test cases to account for their new method of looping through the reviews to compare new reviews with previous ones.
1,"Team has added most of the missing screenshots. There will be no design patterns involved in bootstrap so i'd say the document is now complete. Only thing i would suggest is, since bacui may not have a wiki, this document can be moved to a wiki page of github repository.�"
1,"The team have taken time to explain each functionality properly in the second round. They list all the changes that they wish to make in the views. However, I would suggest the team to also mark out (circle out) the area they wish to change in the screenshot of the view."
1,"Explanations are okay , there needs to be more detail on what is being done and how the final outlook view would be. As of now not much details have been put in the document. A before and after view would have adequately shown the impact the this work will make.�"
1,"For the ""manage participant"" part, the authors didn't explain how will they solve the issue that the ""add student"" button cannot work correctly after a user add a course. The document included other changes need to be made, but the explantation was not clear enough. The design used a lot of components in Bootstrap, but the authors didn't give any explantations to these components they would use and didn't give any diagrams to show what the changes will be like."
1,The authors only explain what needs to be changed but no specific steps. If would be better if they can provide more details about how will they implement the functions they mention�in the document.
1,Yes the document mainly talks about small changes at different places in the application that are being done. I think more implementation details with ample justification are missing. if the team is using certain apis why are they using should have been mentioned.��
1,The design is not clear enough. More details are needed.
1,"The design changes appear simple and clear. Only suggestion to the team would be to explain the design choices a little more. As mentioned above, give an example of how, where to use Bootstrap and Jumbotron."
1,"It�s an UI intensive project, so no specific design approaches are applicable. But the team should have put it more details into the document to elaborate the changes and they choice of tools under the bootstrap framework. Like a pill or navtab or navbar is going to be used to achieve a particular look, and if one of them, why the choice. Such details on decisions should be included in the design document."
1,"The team has provided current system UI, but no expectations on the UI for this project. For an UI intensive project, I believe it�s essential to have at least a minimal wireframe that serves as the base for good design document so every stake-holder can be on the same page with regard to expectations."
1,"The authors�provide some screenshot of the pages they need to change. It would be better if they provide more diagrams to explain their design, for example, a UML diagram about the relationship of all the class they need to change."
1,I meant to leave this blank. Kindly ignore the rating for this question as this project does not require any tests. All the changes made are CSS related.
1,"Yes, design seems fit. More insight required on the algorithm itself and how it will be implemented."
1,"Yes, the explanations�provided for changes to be made are clearly mentioned . The authors are very clear what and where to make changes.�Use of flowchart makes reviewer to understand their approach more quickly and easily. Suggestion: No test plan is included in the project"
1,Yes the author has explained the adequately the changes to be made to the system by giving a detailed flow diagram of the workflow of the the would be implementing the functionality of keeping a track of the review time of a student
1,Actually they talked a little about previous work from E1791 project and a lot about what they gonna do. But it's better to have some contrast.��
1,the design design dicument seems to be written well and organised into nice categories so as to be easily readable. Though the team hasn't� made any changes since the last update. The team could have added a UML diagram and test plan in order to better explain the project.
1,The design seems to follow appropriate principles and pattern. It is simple and�clearly explains what needs to be done and where the changes will be made. Suggestion: addition of screen mock-ups to document will help reviewers a lot.
1,The team has clearly defined the objective of the project. The have also stated the approach that they are about to use to solve the problem. They have also clearly added the schema for storing the time information that the user will spend on a particular review. The only thing the team could have added was to create a UML diagram defining the classes that are changed or added� and adding what attributes are added and what functions modified/added. The team haven't mentioned any design pattern as such but the proposed� plan explains the idea well.
1,"The design document is very simple and easy to read. Detailed explanation about the objective, the proposed plan for each objective, database schema and the user flow chart is defined clearly. The team could have added CRC cards to improve detailing about the code changes."
1,"The design�isn't extremely simple to understand at first glance. But given that the feature to be implemented is slightly complicated, the team has made efforts to make it as clear as possible."
1,"Yes, the database design and flowchart gives a clear picture what system will do after the required changes. Suggestion: add before & after changes screen mock-ups to your document."
1,As such the project description does not ask for any visualizations.� But visualization in terms of UML diagram or a CRC cards would have been a helpful way to make the description better.
1,"Visualization�offers only a flow chart, but other UML diagrams like class diagram would have been more helpful.,��"
1,"No, it doesn't.� Suggestion: Team should add a test plan which includes tests for testing the required changes."
1,"There is no test plan. For this project it could be difficult to test the exact time returned. However, it would be a good idea to test that the report page in fact shows the statistics."
1,No test plan is included. They can have manual testing for the ui at least if automated is out of scope.
1,"No test plan added, they where missing the last time as well. You guys should add them telling how you exactly plan to test the changes you make, even if its a small change it should be mentioned how it was tested."
1,Haven't included the test plan
1,The UML Use Case diagram takes into consideration the system specifications and the manner in which the users interact with each other in the process. It makes it easy to analyze how the implementation can take place in the current scenario.�
