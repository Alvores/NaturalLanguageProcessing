Sentence,LabelI think if you expanded on what you wanted your music playing device would do or even look/ sound like it would have stretched your thinking a bit more.,1If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation.,1I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece.,0"Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play"".",0Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project?,0Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control??,0"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague.",0"The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers.",0"All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner.",0"Using the ideas laid out with creating music using RGB values, I think we could make something that also looks at everyday objects and people to create music in an experimental manner.",0"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into.",The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.,A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.,Another ipod?,A program that reads color and turns it into music.,"A program that uses the keyboard controller they proposed in the first idea, but instead of just playing & recording music, the keys would also play colors that the creator would match up to certain notes or sounds according to their perception of emotion.","In all of the projects, he or she discusses the use of lasers.","Though the projects are very similar in their use of lasers, they are also fairly different ideas.",The student made a good effort to expand upon their ideas and give details.,"They want one project using lasers as a form of data transfer, laser interactive project and another basic max/patch laser project.",Using a laser to initiate sounds while playing a game.,Passing data via laser doesn‰Ûªt seem plausible to me.,"There are definitely three separate ideas proposed, but all based around similar technology: lasers.","All seem like pretty solid ideas; one being to make a simple environment where laser are pointed at targets to create musical tones, another using laser signals to beam data between devices, and the last using lasers for a target practice type game.",The first and third ideas seem most plausible.,"Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit.","Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator.","Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc.",I feel the student elaborated enough to get o good idea of what they are aiming for.,The first idea is to create some kind of musical instrument incorporating lasers.,The second idea is to use lasers to send information to different devices they also stated that some of the technology may need to be further developed.,The last idea is some sort of shooting game with lasers and a projector.,I think that the video game idea using lasers is possible to accomplish this semester.,But maybe using a wii remote would work better than using the kinect since there may not be too much motion.,The first one the student wants to make is a music system which controlled by some unique instruments.,The second one is to build anthropopathic robot soldiers.,The third one is to build a virtual reality glove.,The glove project is the most interesting project.,"It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know.",But you can develop the idea further.,"For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects.","Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome.","Overall, I believe this person put a decent amount of thought into the ideas.",Each idea is written vividly and thoroughly.,The first idea is basically to create a device that generates midi sounds with an arduino and some buttons/knobs.,"The second idea is basically creating remote control soldiers for the use of the army, essentially making military deaths a thing of the past.",The third idea is to create a glove that works with the oculus rift to track hand movements to be translated into the virtual world within the oculus rift.,"If I were to collaborate with this student, I would try and find a good blend between using the oculus rift and glove ideas, with the robot army idea.","They both are necessary for eachother, so I think that makes complete sense.","These projects - a simple midi controller, soldier drones, and a video game glove - have all been proposed many times.","We see these types of things all the time in movies, and occasionally in real life.","It doesn't seem like the thinking was stretched very much, but that previous ideas were re-used.","Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done.","My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller.","However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap.",Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller.,"Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester.","This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time.","The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing.","The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death.","The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback.","The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project.","Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something).","This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall.",The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions.,"Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity.",I'd love to work with the arduino live music control.,"One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience.","This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations.",They definitely made a sincere effort in writing this assignment.,They do propose three things.,The first being idea being to create a video or a website.,The second idea was to create an app that would keep people informed of basically what is going on in the world and how they could help.,The third being an app that allowed people attending a concert to be able to listen to it through their personal device which would also allow them to adjust the EQ settings of the audio.,I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending.,I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world.,
