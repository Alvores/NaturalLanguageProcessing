initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller.",0"However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap.",0Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller.,1"Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester.",0"This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time.",0"The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing.",0"The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death.",0"The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback.","The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project.","Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something).","This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall.",The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions.,"Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity.",I'd love to work with the arduino live music control.,"One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience.","This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations.",They definitely made a sincere effort in writing this assignment.,They do propose three things.,The first being idea being to create a video or a website.,The second idea was to create an app that would keep people informed of basically what is going on in the world and how they could help.,The third being an app that allowed people attending a concert to be able to listen to it through their personal device which would also allow them to adjust the EQ settings of the audio.,I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending.,I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world.,I think that would be the best bet.,"The ideas feel somewhat proposed as they are, though I'm left with many questions as to how something would be made or how complicated it would be.",The first idea talks about skills more than what can be accomplished.,"It seems that this student is not entirely aware of what they can do with their skillset, specifically due to lack of programming knowledge.",The second idea is understandable yet I'm not sure as to how this would take a large amount of money and time.,"It feels like setting up an incredibly large and intricate information system, then giving that information to the user in a simplified format.",The third idea is clear though the student does not write about how something like that is feasible; I feel that it's less of a technical project on the student's end and would mostly require interacting with and convincing the performers and producers at the concert to let them hook up things for the app to work.,"I'd shift this student's third idea away from live concerts and more towards an app that could simulate what an actual concert might be like given some music, wherever they may be.","It would consist of the same features and would focus more on the app's software than interacting with music that is currently playing, allowing users to play a song and change various settings to make it sound as if it was being played live.",I would feel that it would be more feasible and more about the technical efforts than interacting with musicians themselves.,"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas"".","I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS.","Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level.","I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project.",We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume.,We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max.,Overall I felt that the student made a good effort to explain their ideas.,An unspecified rough app or computer program.,A series of sensors in bikes and/ or cars that alert drivers/ cyclists to potential collisions.,An app that the city/ police can use to see where cyclist have had accidents or poor experiences so that changes can be made to prevent future accidents.,"Rolling with this idea, the student and I could make an app that would allow people to rate and share experiences of certain routes or part of a city for use by cyclists.","Users would record their experiences, along with a positive or negative rating, and link them to a certain area on a map of the city.","Overall ratings for different areas would show up over time, giving both locals and visitors a map of safe biking routes and notable places to avoid.",This student is looking to create a prototype of an interface that is beneficial to those who like to ride their bicycles on the road and care about their safety.,"I think they did clearly propose their motivations and thoughts, being concerned with improving public cycling collisions and allowing some sort of warning system.","I am a cyclist myself and have designed my own apps on photoshop, so this actually is interesting to me.",Maybe in the app include some of the traffic going on in areas and color coding the safety with the roads.,I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student.,The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling.,Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.,I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling.,"I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,","You have a great goal, to make cycling safer.",If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this.,A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea.,It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes.,What other ways can this be done?,If I was your partner I think Id like to focus on researching the ways large cities are doing this.,Id like to propose a way to physically make cycling safer threw lights that interact with cars and the roadways.,If we could come up with a way to make communication easier for a cyclist while they ride I think that would achieve some part of your goal.,If we could update a rider of upcoming dangers as they ride that would be helpful.,This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations.,"I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer.","I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something.","I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design.","The first, week-long project would simply be an outline for a longer-term project.",The second idea is to develop some form of cerebral interface for virtual reality games.,The third idea is to create an AI that learns from it's mistakes.,I could help to develop the visual representations for this world the AI will explore or meld with.,But that's about all I'd have to offer to this project.,"1) A quick board/video game2) NCVR - Virtual Reality that is truly immersive (utilizing all senses)3) Creating an AIIt seems like they really put some thought into it, as it all seems to build upon each other.","However, the semester idea seems perhaps too ambitious.","It might be interesting to do sort of an augmented reality space - a physical landscape used in a ""game"" in which a user completes tasks/challenges with the aid of things like visual displays (a la Google Glass) and actuator gloves.",He/she has ideas about the game design are related human body and nervous system.,His/her plans and ideas are related each other.,"Also, he/she has rough design concept and I think he/she has potential energy to develop and realize the system.","That is not perfect yet, but it would be great project under his/her plans during this collaboration project.","Also, his/her NCVR project is not far away from today.",I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI.,"If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system.",This project is quite impressive for me.,"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I.",This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR.,"Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge).","By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together.","The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals.",Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off.,Yes they made a effort with their three ideas being.,To build a moto-Bike of some sort similar to a moped.,To create a water powered system to create energy.,To make an interactive environment  with lasers and such.,I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.,I think they thought about what they wanted to do.,It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment.,It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.,This student mentioned wanting to do some kind of game and I wanted to do games and incorporate fitness and gaming.,So with an arcade game we could find a way to make something that got the body moving.,He also wanted to do something with generating power but with water.,Well we could make a game that generated power based on body movement.,That would be really fun.,Put a motor on the bike.,Find some thing can save water or other resources.,Using laser technology into projection mapping.,I am very interesting in the third idea.,I am also like projecting mapping and interactive project.,"Base on your idea, I would like to do some ""gun"" game.","The gun could have the laser in it, so when you ""shoot"" the wall, the wall will has a ""real"" black hole.","On the projection mapping wall, we can create some visual effects that has strong connection with the gun.",I love the idea of cars running on water.,The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular.,"Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic.","We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall.",The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool.,They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words.,"i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet.","Okay:I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way.",Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.,"Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan.",Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.,"These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air.","Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas.",I would take idea number 2 because at least we both would be interested in some kind of reform in education funding.,We could work on an artpiece that would show how our government allocates money.,"Since we would be tackling politics, having the funds of billions of dollars would allow us to say whatever is necessary, regardless of what corporations/people are offended.","I mean, they didn't really propose anything for the first idea.","Technically, they answered the actual question to the fullest, because it asked ""what could you yourself accomplish in a week?""","They said that with one week to do something, they could get the planning phase done, and start to draw up concepts to actually get a finished product.",There was no idea stated.,"For the second, they gave more of an idea of creating a way to make higher education accessible to all those who wish to further their learning, but beyond that there was nothing.","The same goes for the third idea, there was not a specific idea to state, but rather that it would be better to work in a group to get stuff done.","Literally, it's almost impossible to get something done with this students ideas, because there is nothing to go off of.",The only thing to go off of would be that we would be coming together for one cause.,I do not believe that this student took much time and getting this homework assignment or really tried.,"There isn't much to be able to think about here, and although buying convertibles for everyone sounds like a good idea, it doesn't have anything to do with our major or creating something from nothing.",There is nothing I can collaborate with another student on because they didn't write enough idea down for something to be created in a partnership.,"Idea 1: It is not really a full idea, but rather a general 'first steps to a larger project'  outline.","Idea 2: The idea is to assemble a team that can work to find a way to make a college education free for everyone, or to buy everyone a sports car should this team prove unsuccessful.","Idea3: This is not really a full idea either, but it builds on the idea of assembling a team presented in Idea 2.","While the specifics of the process this student would like use when starting to work on something are fleshed-out a bit, the specifics of what this student would like to do are only expressed in the Second idea concerning free college education.",So it is a little vague.,"My ideas involved animation, and this students ideas involved collaboration/team-building and taking on a major issue (College costs).","So a joint project might take the form of an exploration of some major problem or concern, and an animation that enhances some aspect of our efforts or our reporting.","It might be used to explain the problem, to explain a proposed solution, to explore the issue further, or report on the successes or failures of our efforts.","In many things, including animation, a team usually make it easier.","Ideas 1 and 3 do not have a definitive project idea and are more so how far along one could develop the stages of making an idea in that time, whereas 2 the idea is to find a way to make education free to individuals.","In idea one the student states that they could outline and blueprint some rough ideas of what a final project may do, and plan the next stages to get there.",In idea 3 the student states that they would recruit a team of individuals to develop a more cohesive project.,I feel personally that I could help with the first idea of planning things and putting them into motion.,One thing I could do would be possibly build some rough prototypical components of some ideas they have to gauge how it might function in a real life application.,"I believe that the student made a sincere effort into their answers for ideas 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent idea 3.","Idea 2 could have used some more clarification as I am not wholly sure what these group games are, while idea three could use some expanding upon.","Their one week idea was to create a mini-game that tested the end users reaction time and post their ""score"" on an internet serve, thus allowing players to rank their times.If they were given no time or money limit they would want to construct a world fitness center that both explores the concept of group games that promote healthy fitness as well as having machines/other equipment that help the users stay fit.",They are willing to offer prize incentives for working overtime.,For their semester goal they wish they wish to be more involved in their gaming company and create several more games for a college student audience that help them with their class studies.,"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something.","Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world.","Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience.","Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general  college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus.",This student did a great job at stretching their thinking.,"There are three ideas present, each with their own unique twist on them due to the limitations of either time or money.","The first idea is a game, not sure what platform, that calculates reaction time of the user.","It would be awesome to have further discussion on what this could be used for; personally, I see this mini-game being used for competition entertainment between friends.",The second idea is a group of games used to encourage a healthy and fit lifestyle by using a reward benefactor to motivate people.,The third idea touches briefly on the student's passion to expand their gaming company.,"In the past I have worked on classical compositions, musicals, and even post production for short films.","In this case, I would love to use my skills in sound design, musical composition, and as a musician to integrate sound and audio into the experience of games.",I would love to find a way to use sound in a way that it has never been used for in games to create a dynamic interactive experience in games.,"On a much more simple note, I would also like to create the theme music for this person's games.",As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points.,I like the idea of the game for fitness.,I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports?,I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout.,The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea.,I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality?,An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.,I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well.,If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on.,If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.,"Idea 1: a simple game that measures reaction time to different situations, and shows these times against the times of others.","Idea 2: A collection of games that promote exercise and fitness, some of which incorporate gym equipment, all of which are part of a larger businesslike organization.",Idea 3: Expanding an already established gaming company that focuses on college course material.,This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them.,"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve gaming (specifically concerning fitness and foundation building for classes).",So a joint project would probably take the form of a video game.,"I have done 3D art for video games, and any game that incorporated character animation (as so many do) would align with my main interest in animation.",The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out.,"None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas.",I like the idea for the graphic design that would get the world excited about helping make earth a better place to be.,"I have a similar idea that I think could go along this, adding social media capabilities, and getting as many people involved as possible.","The first and third ideas - using hand-painted images for a wedding, etc.","book, and educational games - have been done many times over.","The second idea - changing the look of a building based on internal or external activity - seems like it could be done easily enough, and I don't know that it's been done before.",I think I would want to scale down the second idea.,"Instead of changing the outside of a building, we could make a projection that alters image based on interaction of viewers in front of a sensor such as a kinect.",There is a coherent project idea in each answer.,A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions.,An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way.,A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining.,Working on a small game or proof of concept that taught geologic principles through exploration of underground tunnels and caves would be a potential idea.,"The idea for this is to have students discover different types of rock and geological processes while actually down in the depths of the earth, showing why this information si interesting firsthand.","I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3.","How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""?",What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom?,"His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea.",The three ideas can be combined into one.,I am thinking of displaying the wedding book's pictures at the side of the Skyscraper where people passing by can interact with the pictures with their hand movements as though they are playing video games.,"The first idea was a scanable storybook program, that simplifies and makes creating photo albums easy and simple.","The second was to create a building that would react to people in, around, and people looking at the building, interacting visually with all of them.","The third idea is video game education program, working inside schools and possibly outside.","The ideas were sincere but the last idea really could have been explained a bit more, all ideas are good.","Especially the building idea, it really makes me wish that existed in a large scale.","Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space.",Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in.,"There are three good ideas present, however not all answers have deeply thought out ideas.",I love the ideas but I wish the student would have expanded on their ideas.,The first idea is to create a first person shooter game.,I like the idea of creating a map/level that can be added to a first person shooter game.,"It would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content.",The second idea is to build a gaming team to create video games that raise discussion on important topics/issues in the world.,These games will also keep the traditional aspect of what a game is.,The third idea would be to create an exploration game.,"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content.",I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process.,It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games.,"This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox.","Idea one is to design a game, non-functional, but with the architecture in place.",Idea two is to essentially make their own video game development company and eventually build the best game possible.,"Lastly, idea 3 is to make a small exploration driven game, examples are stated but I have no experience with any of them to know what they may be.","I do not have any experience with game design whatsoever, and very limited experience with building 3D models only in Rhino for prototypes, I do not believe that could be taken into Unity or anything like that as far as I know.","What I can do however is lots of audio based things so I feel I could definitely help this person in making a game by being a sound engineer, capture foley-esque sound effects to implement in the game, and I could even write some accompanying music.","I think this could make for a great experience, having a visual expert and audio expert on the same team, I do not know how to program these songs in any game engine however, I could only make them.",You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game.,"since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?",i could help with what goes on in the game.,The story line or goal in the game.,A first person shooter game.,He would like to do many games to gain experiences.,Then he will use his experience to do a big game which has important topics to the society.,3.A small exploration driving game.,"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer.",So I am interesting in his game level design.,It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level.,But I have no idea about how to do that.,Hope to see your game!,"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them.",1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like?,"If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon?","Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device?",What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?,2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits.,What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation?,Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track?,The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range.,I would choose to help work on their mobile device application.,Although I would try to specialize the app in one particular area like sound and the measurement of decibels.,From there I could branch out into using gps tracking data in order to link connections between the decibel readings and the location of the device.,This could be used to help find good study locations and develop better studying habits.,I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.,"If I was to work with this student, then I would extend the app to maybe act more like a artificial intelligence machine to interact with its users.",The answer in the first idea is pretty vague.,The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project.,"The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system.","The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet.","If the student is serious about creating an app, then maybe we could create a storytelling app with a significant visual element, like a web comic but with some interactivity.",Maybe a choose your own adventure with dynamic visuals and some animation.,They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things.,The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible.,The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices.,The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.,"I like the idea of using patrol devices, but this can be risky since I'm sure they will not be cheap and you have to worry about people messing with or breaking or stealing them.",I also like the idea of creating an app as sort of a personal side kick.,I think these ideas are pretty well thought out and practical.,The doorknob thing sounds kinda fun.,Each of these ideas take the concepts and skills we're developing in DC and applying them in imaginative ways.,I'd love to draw storyboards for this person's Great Wall idea.,The idea of displaying cultural history in a visually dynamic way is intriguing to me.,"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas.","I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people.","Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on.","However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas.","I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way.",You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money.,"I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources.","Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas.",1.A project that involves touch and sound.,"When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds.",2.Large scale projection mapping.,The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments.,The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.,3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people.,The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me.,I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector.,I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.,"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original.","There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises.","Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping.","Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale.",Idea 1 is a selection of art combined into a single project/piece.,Idea 2 is to create new methods of motors to create sustainable energy.,Idea 3 is animated show that is breaking the mold of classic sci-fi.,"The first couple ideas could use a bit more explaining, but the third idea really has some cool aspects to it.","The animated series could perhaps have a social side to it, adding an app that connects you to the story or character backgrounds and more information behind the scenes.",Allowing for people who are following the series to better connect with the show.,"The three ideas were creating concept art or a single image, developing a energy motor that can run on simple forces, and lastly creating a animated series that won't be like the generic ideas that are on today.",The last idea sounds like something that I would watch to be honest.,Also maybe expand on what kind of programs you use for your designing process.,I would blend the first idea about the concept art and the sci-fi animated series.,I like the idea of the sub-plot of the post-apocolyptic world without a generic lead character.,"I feel I would be able to provide some ideas for story of single episodes and also with the design of the concept art and image design, because that is some of my focus is on digital image editing.",I think he/she seem like a visualist or animator and want to make project is related with visual things.,"However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make.",It was little hard to imagine what project would be.,"However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project.","Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time.","I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester.",I think the student could use more time hashing out these installations.,The first is just some sort of projection mapping but doesn't state if it would be interactive or just constant.,The second is for a social network app but doesn't state any specific options or utilities that would distinguish itself from other already in place.,The final idea is more thought out and is focused on humanistic traits and displaying them on a projection.,They don't state what traits or behaviors would be studied but it sounds interesting.,I would try and help this person focus on specific traits or behaviors like people laughing or smiling.,Then I would try to help figure out what we would project on to and how we would capture the specific media.,"The student talks about his/her strengths and areas of interest, which makes it easier to brainstorm what he can do.",The idea for the second question is a bit ambiguous and confusing in terms of goals and focuses.,Is the goal to solve problems with social network or bring awareness to general world issues?,"His three ideas are coming up with ideas for a project, building an app, and an installation that captures human features.","This person's ideas can lead to one project that is an app which may be used to feature in videos different people around the world, raising the awareness of culture and different societies.","This student could have gone into a little more detail no how they wish to go about their ideas (what programs they would use), but over all it seems like they took this assignment with sincerity.","Their first idea however was their least expanded upon thought, and as such should have been thought harder upon.","I understand their ideas and their direction quite well, so to me they have clearly proposed their points.","Their ideas: One Week: With their love of creating installations they want to create a projection mapped scene unto existing architecture.",Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create an application or social network that is designed to help solve global problems expediently and with relative ease.,"Realistic Semester: An installation that explores human behavior and our physical attributes, as demonstrated by using photography or video through the process of projection mapping.","Expanding upon your third idea, maybe you could intermix installation, projection mapping, and a phone application.",The phone application could simply ask them to photograph what they look most about their own body and what they dislike most about it before they enter the installation.,When they arrive their phone will be pinged and two new images will be displayed into the giant pile of photos being projection mapped.,"This pile of photos will show everyone's likes and dislikes in their own body, their confidence and their unease, but in the end the general effect would be that all these separate attributes make up what it means to be human.","So, all of the ideas were extremely vague.",For the week limit I'm not even sure where they would go with it besides doing some research.,"I'm interested to hear more about what they would do to make something that helps with depression, because I think that would be a fun and helpful project to make.","Again, the public interaction project was also vague and I'm not really sure what else you would need to make people interact with each other in a large area.","I would also like to hear more about how you would make people feel sound like, would it just be the heavy sounds like bass?",Or would it be all kinds of notes?,If we were branching out on one of the projects I would probably go off of the machine to help with depression.,I think we'd need to do a lot of research on what there already is out there to help with depression and then see what works and what does not.,"I also think this machine would be a branch off point for helping with it, because if a person were to become dependent on the machine it would not be what we'd be going for.",The ideas here are quite vague.,"They are good ideas, but I think more detail and thought needs to be put forth, in order to really conceptualize what you would want to do.","The idea in which you would get people to interact in public spaces is a good one, and I would think that we could add visual and audio elements in order to unify people of multiple cultures and backgrounds.","This could be achieved through the use of music, or even something that can look at a person's face and find someone with similar facial features on the other side of the world.","They had a very small starting point, as in something they want to address, but not much planning as to how to accomplish it.",Their 3rd idea interests me because I'm interested in creating art spaces that allows the viewer to have an experience.,I don't think that this person has a solid idea yet to achieve a physically sound space though.,I proposed a piece about finding your inner peace/purpose and a key component to it was incorporating sound and lights.,"These are all directions that the student would like to take, but none of them actually mention a project idea.",No project idea available.,"An instillation that allows people to interact and meet each other more easily in a public setting, potentially for the purpose of combatting depression.","""Something that makes people feel physically sound""",An instillation that forces people who don't know each other into conversation or close proximity to participate would be applicable.,"One of the issues with depression is connecting with other people, but another is fear, so the instillation would have to be comfortable, inviting, exciting, but needs to also put people together and looking at each other.","This could be a good starting point for a project for the X-Space next to the design building, a seating solution of some sort.","There were not really given any detailed ideas, or showed a process to stretch their thinking on the ideas.",The answers were vague and did not show any thought on HOW they would go about curing depression or how to make people physically feel sound.,"In the first idea, it seemed though they avoided answering the question and just showed that they would accept a project for their limits, but what project?","As for the cure depression, why not make it be both serious and lighter like use comedy or humor technique to try to cure depression.","Also expand more on the idea of how to make people physically feel sound, like is it just going to be turning the bass of on speakers or something else entirely?",Some of the ideas were not clear enough to find a common ground but I would choose the create a interactive system that can help the public interact with others in the same public space.,Something with projection and interactive game environment.,I agree with the severity of drunk driving and the punishment and fines of DUI's so the idea is an interesting idea.,Drunk driving should never be allowed due to the safety of other drivers and the person that is under the influence.,A product that recgonize a person's alcohol level in real time is a good idea.,"However the product your talking about is a breathalyzer, it uses to test out a person's alcohol level.",I believe if you can come up with an app perhaps that has the same function but a different method of testing that would be pretty amazing.,I  like the idea of this product.,I also like the idea of turning A mountain to a display/projector that displays lights and videos.,If you can get enough man power and fundings that would be a great project to work on.,It also represent ASU for it creativity and the teachings that ASU provides for its students.,I like the idea of a product that tests the alcohol level.,The only downside to testing this would be involved in heavily drinking which can be enjoyable but not safe at the same time?,If we can create like a phone application that somewhere tests this it would be a great project to work on.,They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas.,The first would be to go over different plans to try and find the best and most effective one.,The second is to create a device that would allow you to view your blood alcohol level so you can know when to stop.,The third would be to turn a mountain into a giant HD TV.,I really like the idea of having some way for a person to check their blood alcohol levels.,It would be a good idea if it was an accessory for like an iphone that you just pop on to your phone.,"It would also be cool if there was an app associated with it that gave you some tips to pace yourself and once it shows you your blood alcohol level and its quite high, it could calculate how long you should wait until you should have another drink so to not go over the limit.","I felt that these ideas were clear, and enough detail was provided.","Idea 1: Classmate believes that they could adequately get through the planning stage of a project, and perhaps further if working in a group.","Idea 2: Create a device that can measure blood alcohol level in real time, and alert a person when they are too drunk to drive.",Idea 3: Turn a mountain or large piece of architecture into a high definition television.,I think creating a device that measures blood alcohol levels is a great idea.,"I think that if this device were hooked up to the ignition of the car, and physically prevented individuals who were over the limit from driving, that would be even better.","Out of the ideas this classmate provided, this project would be the one that I would most like to work on.","One of the ideas was to make a drunk driving device that tells you when your drunk, I believe this already exist but I bet their version would be better anyways.",The other Idea was to turn A mountain into an HD TV which would be awesome and I feel like other schools/cities would follow along If its done successfully.,The 1st question didn't even ask for a project just if we could get some stuff done in a week so this student made a super sincere effort and expressed their ideas fully.,If they could build the HD TV on A mountain and we could use my idea of the mobile mouse case to control it.,Making them famous and giving my product free advertisement in a way would be the greatest collaboration in ASU history.,"This person shows clear thoughts of what she can or would do, especially when she bring in an example like the firefly mirrors in question 2.","However, the idea in question 2 is vague regarding how the supposed sensors would change a similarly supposed mirror room.","Her three ideas are a projection mapping of some simple and cheap materials, an interactive installation that deals with mirrors, and collages of human freckles displayed using projection mapping.","I like the idea of using mirrors in an installation piece and the projection mapping of human freckles, so I would combine these two and work on creating a mirror maze that uses projection mapping to reflect freckles onto people as they walk in the maze.",This student gave a sincere effort in expressing their ideas.,One of the idea was to do some project mapping with freckles and the other project worked with mirrors and lights.,This person really like project mapping and the MAX program.,I feel like we could somehow mix the mirror project with my mobile mouse case to make some type of mirror control device.,Honestly not to sure how we could combine our ideas.,Okay i can sense this person may be interested to work with face-tracking technology.,There is a lot about freckles and mirrors going on here there is a bit of sublime desire to work with the theme of intrapersonal interpretative arts.,"I am not sure if I would think of something interesting to do with the freckles in an audiovisual and/or interactive aspect, to be completely honest.",It depends entirely on the kind of impact you wish to create.,"Say, if it's to spread the message of freckles being beautiful, there may be a way to capture others' freckles with a webcam and maybe using FaceRig: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXylVvwvY94 ; using a registered 3D capture of the freckled person.","Again, it all depends with the intention of this project's director.",The student made a sincere effort into the project.,"There are three distinct project ideas, two involving projection mapping and another related to peoples freckles..",Projection map freckles onto a face!,The bubble idea is great.,I wish you gave some more possibilities other then a response to motion just to practice stretching out your thinking.,Now I want to make an installation with bubbles!,"Id suggest using e-textiles in an installation piece as opposed to creating a dress, even though the dress idea would be awesome but in one semester that is a big job.","We could do a dress for a doll or a mini dress, I think id be more comfortable with that scale for a project.","But back to the installation with e-textiles, What about a rug, wall paper, curtains, a wig??",Maybe we can throw some bubbles in there too somehow!,"1) Bubble installation, though it makes no mention of what kind.","2) No clear idea3) Was this that dress wearable with the motors?","Because if that can get running, that would be awfully neat.","It seems like they've focused in on making a past project work, and didn't put much thought into the other ideas.","Frankly, I would love to put together some sort of installation with bubbles.","It might be interesting to have a machine pumping out bubbles, take video, run it through a max patch (maybe frame differencing?)",and have the movement of the bubbles synthesize music or colors being projected.,That could be way cool.,"The three ideas are creating a installation involving bubbles based on motion, hiring more people to come up with ideas and choose the best to work with, and lastly creating a dress.",They were all expanded on and they made an effort to explore ideas and gave it a sincere effort.," I love the idea of the bubbles based on motion, I do love playing with bubbles when I can but this is very interesting because I would love to hear more ideas that you can do with this.",I can't think of any ideas to further the bubbles process but it would be something interesting to explore more.,I also want to hear more about this dress and what you did last semester.,I have actually been on Adafruit myself and worked with EL Wire before when I made a Tron Outfit for a highschool dance.,I was apple to replicate a Daft Punk helmet that lit up and also create a sloppy but functional Tron outfit that lit up and was wearable.,So I would love to hear more about what you are trying to do with this dress and where you would like to go with it.,"I think for the most part the student took the time to really think about the answers, especially pulling from their own experiences.","I do, however, think that they could have thought about it specifically a little more.","Although, yes, everyone love bubbles, and it would be a great toy for young kids to have motion-sensored bubbles but I'm not sure it's something that was thought of with a  lot of effort.","I also don't think that getting money from Bill Gates was thought of, if the money is just going to go to other people to think of ideas.","Unfortunately, I don't have much interest in working with these ideas unless we expanded on the bubbles idea, or if there was a better explanation for the third answer with more of a digital culture aspect, that we could work together.","1) Temptation box, ultimately punishing the user and giving no reward.",2) Giant robots!,"3) Humanoid robotIt doesn't seem very fleshed out.","I've always wanted to build a ""Hall of Presidents""-esque automaton of myself.",It might be interesting to combine this person's robotics skills with my narcissism.,Idea 1: A clear dispenser containing something desirable (maybe even irresistible) that warns people not to use it.,"When used, it shocks the user and plays broken, giving them nothing but a pain in the hand.",Idea 2: A robotic sculpture whose size would compare to their depictions in anime.,"Idea 3: A motion controlled robot, designed to compete in a Japanese competition.",This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them.,"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's idea's involve robots.","So a joint project could maybe take the form of a robot that is controlled by a virtual control rig, like those used to animation virtual 3d characters in video games and animated films, allowing animators to use familiar controls to design complex motion in a real robot.","So for idea one, I'm getting that this person would like to mess with people.",It would be interesting to see what people do with a big DO NOT TOUCH button that implies you get a reward if you do touch it.,I think if you went a littler further with the idea you'd probably be able to get some recordings of the people doing it and/or have something else happing if the person does not touch the button.,Idea two/Idea three seems to be what you're set on.,"It would be really neat to see a giant robot but with time/money being an issue a smaller scale one seems do-able, and you already know who you'd like to work with which is awesome!","So robots are really neat and I feel like if you're already making a bipedal humanoid robot in the 5 feet range, I feel like there is more work you can put into it to help people out.","Instead of making it just so that the robot will compete with other robots, it might be cool to also make it so that when it's not in season it can help people who are disabled or something similar.","Idea 1 is a social experiment that involves pushing a button to get something, but instead you receive a electric shock.",Idea 2 is big robotic sculpture like in anime.,Idea 3 is walking robot that could be used in a Robo competition.,The scope of the last idea is so cool!,I love the idea of the bipedal robo.,I'm not sure what I could propose towards that idea but perhaps having some arduin sensors running that can calculate where faults or weaknesses are.,I love the stretch of thinking between the three ideas.,"For those of us that do not understand anything about robotics and it's terms, I would suggest to expand on your thoughts and ideas.","The first idea is to have a mourned box visible to people walking by that says ""do not press button"".",At first it seems to have a function such as to produce an item to someone but in reality it just shocks the user.,"The second idea is to create a massive multi story robotic sculpture., I understand the use of sculptures but I would love to hear more ideas on the use of this sculpture.",The third idea is to build a robot with the function to compete in a robotics competition in Japan.,I would love to collaborate on the idea of building a multi-story robotic sculpture.,I would like to incorporate my skills in sound design to find creative ways to have these sculptures interact and produce a certain atmosphere in an area.,The ideas proposed here are more of variations on one idea than three distinct ideas.,The main idea presented here is a depiction of tragedies in human society through audio and video to hope to inspire a change.,I think that if we worked together we could take the message and content and move it to a more personal platform.,"Like a mobile app based instillation, something that takes the experience to a more personal level.",I liked your ideas they seem like a strong place to start.,However are you trying to construct a video project based around American society or around the human society as a whole?,"Either way, I seriously doubt that you will run into problems finding enough video to develop a compilation of tragedies in society.",It sounds like a strait forward plan I look forward to seeing the final result if you end up doing this project.,I think that I would help in finding the video coverage of human tragedy.,My question then would be: how far into history are you planning on covering?,"Also, do you plan on using sound clips from the videos that you find?",Or are you planning on using voice overs to address the individual events and to maintain consistency throughout the video?,No they did not make an effort to stretch our thinking.,They had the following ideas  - 1.,A grouping of songs that represent tragic events.,A video that does the same thing.,A video with songs that shows American growth.,It looks like they really want to make a video about America.,Maybe if they made the video interactive in some way I would like to help work on it.,So they have an idea but it was not developed or if it was they did not go into significant detail.,Well they seemed to be very interested in video work so it would be great to do a trailer for my game and have the advertisement and product done in one class.,"The ideas are extremely basic, featuring a theme for a project yet no detail on how it would work.","Each of the ideas talks about making a song or video of American society, seemingly as a growing and tragic community, and doesn't explain how or what will be used to show this opinion.","The second idea explains what the student's end goal would be, yet nothing about why its important or how it would occur.","A simple interactive video game would work similarly to a video for showing how American society has changed, with more of a focus on the player feeling the changes through their actions rather than through watching a video.","This could be tragedies as well, as the game could feature a changing world with both themes.",I really liked the simple ideas of making a painting and hip hop song.,I think that their simplistic and creative natures can be achieved within the confines of the this course.,"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest producing a video compilation of paintings with corresponding songs.","Idea one is to make a song or a painting, though then vaguely stated is the ability to do anything.",Idea 2 is developing a better electric car for mass production.,Lastly idea 3 is to develop a Max patch which provides utility to individuals.,"I feel that with idea 3 I could definitely help build a functional Max patch, I would say that's where most of my programming talents lie.","That would be the immediate application I could provide, however with the billion dollars I would love to work on project number 2.",Previously I've entered an idea into the Edson challenge regarding electric vehicles which I knew wouldn't get anywhere do to it just being a concept.,I like researching and thinking about electric cars and myself am a car guy so it would be awesome to become a co-automaker.,These ideas are extremely general and it is really hard to discern what the thought process is.,"It honestly feels very rushed and that they didn't take the assignment very seriously, or just didn't know what they purpose of the assignment was.",The ideas are very simple to say the least.,1. hip hop song?,digital art?,"Electric car .....3.",???????,this could be anything,Its really hard to tell what this person can actually do or has interest in because the answers are so robotic.,I would say a program that reads hip hop music and animates something would be the closest answer I could give you.,Yes they worked to stretch our thinking.,their three ideas are - 1.,Turn a song into a painting.,2.  make a good alternative vehicle.,Make a MAX Patch.,I think creating a sweet MAX patch would be fun and useful I would totally work on that.,"The student included a painting of a genre, more efficient electric car, and some sort of max patch.",Not clearly specific but at least they have some sort of idea they see themselves working on..,"I like hip hop too so that sounds interesting, I'd like to get more of a clearer idea of what they were thinking.",The first idea is a simple projection mapping that is motion controlled.,The second idea is to develop interactive home software.,The third idea is to create a chandelier that is then mapped on 3dimensionally.,Combined we could develop a type of projection for household appliances that allows you to turn in and interact with certain ones involving gestures.,"I could provide the visual representation, and more ideas.","The later two responses had project ideas, the first did not.",Unspecified project involving projection mapping.,"App that acts as a universal remote for a users home, turning on many different appliances just through being there or looking a certain way.",A projection mapped chandelier?,Creating an app that worked as a TV remote would be a good starting point to the whole house controller.,I think he/she has great skills to install interactive media and projection mapping.,"Also, he/her three ideas are clear and related with each other.",These are about the interactive media system that would be realized in present time or in the future.,I think his/her second idea about the Bluetooth stuff is already existed in some luxury apartments or houses.,"However, it would be great project if he/she develop own systems.",I can imagine how his/her project would be fantastic.,"I think it would be better to connect two project, Bluetooth things in the house and imaginations of 3d chandeliers.","Also, if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, visual and media installation, it would be great project during this semester.",This student made an excellent effort in exploring their ideas.,One of the ideas was to make an app that turns on appliances which is great.,The other two ideas dwelt with projection and mapping which is awesome too.,We could definitely work on that app on turning on appliances with your phone and mix it with my mobile mouse case idea and create something that could put money in both our pockets.,I think this person made a sincere effort to generate ideas for a project.,I am completely unfamiliar with projections mapping and it seems like this person is very interested in it.,"Since I do sculpture fabrication, maybe I could make these comically large chandelier's that have an area like a screen from a tv to project onto.","Like maybe you can juxtapose a very affluent lifestyle on poor things or vice versa and we could create a room to really take you into the lifestyle of someone below poverty level, and someone in the 1%.",In the first idea they mentioned some sort of arduino that measures temperature?,"I am a little confused but sounds interesting, I don't have much knowledge with those controllers.","Idea 3 sounds complicated, moving fast in  a game through a controller, how?","I am learning programming this semester, so maybe I can help program the game?",If I learn quickly enough..,The ideas seem interesting.,"However, more details would help clarify your intentions of certain projects.","They sound cool, but I'd like to know more.","I think with your knowledge of arduinos, we could make some cool concepts regarding tracking and gaming.","These seem like a person's scribbled notes, and took me a little bit to decipher.","They didn't think the ideas all the way trough to the presentation, just the general idea of it.",To me its hard to visualize something if they don't describe the physical parts or generally explain how they would get it done and why it differs from the average idea.,"A computer program thermometer2.","3D printing research3.",Virtual joust?,"Using their supposed knowledge of Arduino, I would assist them in using the data they proposed in getting through temperature in their first idea in order to create a program that reacts to the temperature of bodies within the area.","The more people there are creating more heat in the proposed area (that people would stand in), would affect an animation's speed.","The colder it gets and as it is left alone, the animation would slow down as if being frozen in time.",I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.,"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest that we extend on the idea of making a arduino program that can sense the temperature and gives some sort of results.","This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it.",What would set it apart?,Why make something like this?,Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?,"1. colored light programmed by arduino2.","Virtual Reality gaming3.",Motion Capture rc car,"I would have this student's knowledge of Arduino assist me in getting together a system that plays a colored light when a person presses a button, but then also takes a picture of that person at that same time; thus creating a ""selfie"" filter that is created instantly like a photobooth.","Another use for it is we could do long exposure photos, and the user could press certain lights to light the picture before drawing with their LED.","I felt that although these explanations were brief, and could have used a bit more detail,  the ideas were expressed relatively clearly in such few words.",Idea 1: A program that uses an arduino and three buttons.,"When a button is pushed, an assigned color appears.",Idea 2: A program that makes people feel as though they are part of a virtual reality world.,"The program would involve the whole body, and the user would feel as though they left the real world and were transported into the game.",Idea 3: A program that allows a person to drive a car or fly a plane using only hand movements.,I really liked the idea of a video game that submerged the user into a virtual world.,"I think perhaps with a pair of virtual reality glasses, some sort of smart gloves and shoes, and perhaps some sort of outfit that had different sensors sewn into the material, this might be possible.","This project would however, likely be very involved, and take a great deal of time and resources to accomplish.",I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.,"If I was to work with this student, then I would recommend that we create a system that tracks hand movements but instead of a RC car or plane, we would use a simple robot.","I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use.","For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane.","Reiteration of ideas:Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors.",Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.,Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements.,"I think it would be possible to use their hand movement idea and incorporate it into some kind of game, perhaps made in Unity.","A possible idea would be to use the Kinect and have the camera track hand movements, and certain hand movements would control the character/plane/car in a simple game.",I think they tried to streak thinking somewhat.,Their 3 ideas are - 1.,An interactive system with arduino.,Make the matrix.,A digital physical system that tracks movement to control an RC device.,I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun.,This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need  to be devised.,"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well.","1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project.",2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs.,"She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible.","3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli.","The project of most interest to me would be working to create a therapy program for children with special needs.","I know little about this field, but I believe the project would require a great deal of research, and the creation of applicable audio and visuals.",Given the intent of the assignment the student satisfied all the needs and was very thorough throughout the entire assignment.,They had very clear purpose in the entire assignment and were very concise.,In the first idea the student stated the steps that they would go through in order to complete a project in a week.,"In the second idea the student was very clear on what they would do with the money in the answer and what they would use the money for, and to create a machine for special needs children.",The last idea was the student wanting to create a project that records brainwaves.,If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on.,"I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project.","It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas.","The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body.","The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related.","This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software.","I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors.",This student definitely put a lot of thought into all of their project ideas.,"For the first idea, she goes into what she would do for the first week, such as planning, budgeting, getting the proper equipment, and meeting with professionals in the field she wishes her project to be in.","As for the project itself, I'm not entirely sure what she is aiming to do.","She wishes to use neural feedback, as well as feedback from a sensor that gets data from heartbeat.","For the second idea, it sounds like she would use the billion dollars to get a bunch of experts (in their respective fields) to help create a sort of therapy for special needs children.",She would also have a bunch of equipment to show a progression of their healing/recovery.,"To me, it sounds like idea 2 is a further expansion of idea 1, which totally clears some stuff up for me.","For the third idea, it's what has been going on for the previous two.",Using data from the brain and the heart to get some sort of outcome.,She was unsure of what is realistic for the time given this semester.,"She didn't propose three different items, but rather one idea that has different outcomes based on her time and money.",Since it's one idea this is easy!,"For a semester, to have us actually work on, we would definitely need some scaling back.","As far as a sort of machine to measure brain waves, I have no idea how to use it, or where to get one.",This poses a big problem for us.,"As far as something for the heart, this might be a little difficult too.","I'm not sure if you want an actual heart sensor, and what you need it for.","They do have pulse sensors (http://goo.gl/7kFhfY) that you can use to measure heart rate, and are used by putting the sensor at either your fingertip or your earlobe.","The people that created the sensor have a newer version of their product, which may be a better source of a pulse.","With all this, I'm not sure what you would want to accomplish.","I'm not an expert on psychological aspects, so I'm not sure what would come out of having these strapped to a person, especially just for the heart sensor.","You can tell when someone maybe is scared or something, but as far as getting that data and making something out of it, I have no idea.",Especially because you want something that helps special needs children get better treatment I guess?,So the first answer didn't really say anything that this student could accomplish.,It was all very vague and I couldn't figure out what the mobilemousecase project was.,If I knew what this student wanted to work on I would be able to gage what we could do together but I'm not sure what their interests are.,No they did not stretch our thinking.,No idea 2. go to Dubai  3.,A mobile mouse case.,"I dont really know what the mobile mouse case is but going to Dubai sounds like fun,  I had a blast last time I was there.",I like the Dubai Vacation for brainstorming.,I feel that you need to have diversity and variety of locations to brainstorm ideas.,If theres ever a trip like that count me in!,As far as the mobile mouse case idea goes I think you should finish the product.,I saw the pitch and the progress in the previous semester and it is an interesting product.,The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.,The student said that he/she can finish lots of things in a week.,But it depended on the resources.,Go to Dubai for brainstorming.3.,Mobile mouse case!,Sounds cool and I hope you can tell more details about it.,I don't know what mobile mouse case is.,It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse.,Very interesting.,Hope you can do it!,It sounds as if you have one solid idea.,Could you elaborate a little more on it?,"You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?",I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much.,"By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing.",However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project.,I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product.,I would team up with this person and try to figure out a way to record and add video clips into a short loop composition that could be layered similar to how audio can be recorded and looped.,I could just have certain opacities when I record 3-4 different clips and it would create something different and new every time to project.,"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't.",I think their idea 2 was the strongest.,I really liked the idea 2.,"We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances.",The person didn't put too much thought into this one.,The first idea is to create a small digital physical system or installation that looks cool.,The second idea is to connect everyone by creating a internet infrastructure that uses solar/kinetic powered equipment.,The third idea is to simply create a interactive mobile phone app.,"If we were to work in a group, I would try to blend the ideas of a digital physical system, the app, and the internet infrastructure to somehow create some sort of interconnected environment that is connected to all and is controlled by the phone app.",This could be used to interact with others within the environment to do whatever the user wants.,"For example, if someone walks into the environment, I could trigger a device to turn on from my app on the phone.",I don't really feel like this student stretched the thinking on this assignment.,The effort was barely made for this assignment.,I don't know what this student wanted to do so I'm not sure how we could collaborate.,A game or installation is very vague.,"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation.",I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity.,"That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words.","However, many questions about their ideas exist.",Why do we need a new internet infrastructure?,What type of game/app do you want to develop?,"What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?","Their ideas: One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it.",Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.,Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game.,Maybe you could mix your first and third idea for a mobile application that interacts with your physical installation.,People could download the app and answer a few questions (like what did you eat for breakfast?),"and when they arrived at the installation you could scan for their device, pull their questionnaire, and projection map objects that correspond to them (like waffles if that's what they had for breakfast).","The beauty of it would be that other participants in the installation would not know that you were to the one would had waffles, so it would provide a level of voyeurism to each of the participants allowing them to look into someones life without not who they were looking at.","The student here is perhaps overly succinct, but seems confident that they can create something worthwhile over the course of the semester.",I really like the idea of trying to increase and improve internet connectivity in this country.,Other industrialized countries have bandwidth and speed that put us to shame.,Replacing all of the old copper lines with fiber would be awesome!,"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects.","Idea 1 is to make a graphic that they would paint on their motorcycle, from design to finish.",Idea 2 is a movement to get people more active in the US.,Idea 3 is app that connects motorcycle enthusiast to each other.,The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts.,For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.,I think the student put in effort but the ideas are still very vague for idea 2 and 3.,Idea 1 - The idea mentioned painting the body of his motorcycle.,Idea 2 - The idea mentioned creating a project that would make people more physically active.,How would you go about promoting that?,What motive would people have to jog instead of drive somewhere (especially when your destination is very far away)?,Idea 3 - The idea mentioned creating a social media app for motorcycle riders.,"Need more information on what this app does, what software/programming language you are using, etc.","Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another.","On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling.","If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active.","I feel that all of their ideas could have been expanded upon, and I am not really sure what they had in mind for their second idea.",What will this campaign to promote activeness entail?,Would their be commercials and public events to help promote activeness?,How will people commute to work?,Will you design an Arcology and thus eliminate cars altogether?,"I could feel the sincerity behind their words, but they could have been a little more concrete with this desires, this would have helped in the clarity of their plans.","Their ideas: One Week: They would either design a decal or paint a mural on their motorcycle.","Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create a project that somehow makes people more physically active, they wish for this project to lower to usage of automobiles (and thus leading to less pollution and car related deaths).",Realistic Semester: A social media app that acts like an internet forum for motorcycle rides and those who just generally love motorcycles.,I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active).,Maybe we could work that into your project this semester.,"Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it.",You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators.,"You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools.",I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations.,I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.,I think that we could really collaborating on something here.,"For one, I love print design and working in Illustrator to create fun graphics, so I think we would be able to collaborate on motorcycle designs to possibly sell!","I also believe we could make an awesome animation for a health PSA, since I would want to do an animation for my answers last week, and they want do get the word out for people to be healthier, we could collaborate and make a really fun animated PSA about it, and with the money given to us, that we would be able to use it for advertising and getting celebrity endorsements.",I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.,My DC concentration is in Š—“soundŠ— so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.,I think that you have some good ideas.,I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it.,"As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan.","When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs.",Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant?,"Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities?","Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?","I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project.",I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program.,Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino.,"However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential.","Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen.","The three ideas were creating a short film that can inspire and also intrigue an audience, help make the world a better/happier place without the use a pharmaceutical drugs, and to learn more of the side of engineering and development.","Some of the answers were pretty vague, like what type of film do you think would be inspirational, what type of audience or culture would you like to base it off of or target the film to?",What do YOU think can make the world happier?,Just try to expand more on these ideas and it would help.,I would like to start with the idea of the short film and trying to make the world a happier place.,I feel that an inspirational short film can help the world or a group of people feel happier.,What would we base it off of and what target audience would we push it towards?,DidnŠ—Èt go much in depth on any of the ideas.,Pretty vague.,Not sure since I canŠ—Èt seem to figure out what the projects are exactly.,"The student actually made a sincere effort and I believe gave very honest answers, except for the third answer, the student didn't really answer the question or give an idea.","The student actually clearly proposes two things, the first idea was about making an inspirational film, the second idea was about researching what makes a human happy without drugs, and to make a device that trains the human brain to think in a positive and non negative way.",I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on.,"I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways.",Your film idea is kind of vague.,"Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else.","For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made.","You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness.",A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive.,The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program?,"I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers.",I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class.,What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing.,If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input.,"The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for.","In the first idea, they clearly propose they would make a short film that was inspirational and intriguing to an audience.","The only thing about this is, different people feel different emotions.",What is intriguing to one person could bore the living hell out of another.,The second idea is basically saying they want to make people happy!,Without the use of any drugs.,I fully support this idea.,"There isn't really a third idea, just the student saying that they want to work more with the development side of things.","I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective.","Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well.","I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?",The student clearly proposes three separate ideas.,"For the first, the student's idea is for a short film.","While they don't say what the topic will be, they do say that the short would not include explosions or CGI of any sort.","For the second idea, the student would spend the money on something that could give clean water, or make self driving cars.",The third idea was to create music.,So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester.,You could combine the first and third ideas though.,"Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?",I think he/she seem like a visual artist and want to make project is related with visual things.,"However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make.",It was little hard to imagine what project would be.,"However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project.","Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time.","I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester.","Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff.",These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better.,Idea 1: a short film discussing a topic of interest.,"Idea 2: Work to organize and fund the creation of something that could provide clean water to people, or use a similar process for a different issue.",Idea 3: Make music.,"Though the specifics are a little vague, this student has proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them.","My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making.",So a joint project might could take many forms.,"Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both.","Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs.",The student wrote vaguely about their own motivations and didn't really provide any ideas for a project.,There aren't any proposed ideas to go off of to make into a project,"1) Vague notion of video editing2) vague notion of humanitarian efforts3) Vague notion of creating music.","Basically, it's pretty vague.",Maybe something with iterative video?,Take video of people wanting previous participants and do some sort of synthesis using the similarities (or differences).,"Idea 1: an interaction based installation that incorporates data from different devices, or robotic display.",Idea 2: work to develop cheaper hardware to benefit future designers and problem-solvers.,"Idea 3: A screen made up of a grid of independent, hanging LEDs that move to emulate the reflection on the water in a glass in response to a participant disturbing it.","My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve a robotic screen that reacts to participants' interactions.",So a joint project might take the form of an installation that incorporates animations expressed in physical 3D on a robotic screen and viewer interaction.,"The student said they could make some sort of interactive installation, something robotic, or a matrix made of LEDs for the first idea.","For the second idea, the student said that instead of one huge project, they would would work on making what we have easier to make and at cheaper costs.","This way, more people could make things to solve more problems.","For the third idea, I kind of don't understand it, but that's totally on me because it seems like they know what they are talking about.",I'm just not sure the final outcome.,"To be honest, pretty sure I'm not on this person's level, neither thinking, or actual like tinkering.","Obviously you could blend the first and the third projects because you mention an installation, lights, and robotics.","I'm not sure how interactive the third idea is, but maybe instead of a camera looking at the hanging LEDs from below, it can look at it from above and have people walk under the lights?","This way like if someone is walking and the lights are hanging too low, you can move them up with the pulley system you were mentioning.",And use a Kinect to measure distance.,First idea is to develop an interactive light show or system.,"The second idea is to find ways to make things that are expensive and time consuming to do now, cheaper and more efficient.","The third idea is to okay with light, water, and perception.",Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.,"The person has a broad range of interests, but I feel that the first two responses are really vague since they talk about what kind of projects they want to work on rather than what projects.","Also, what they specified in the first question may be something that would be more than they can handle in one week.",The third idea is much clearer as they explain their project and its structure and functions.,"Their three ideas are some project that deals with electrical devices, a cheap hardware to help people, and a mechanical display that moves in fluid-like motion.","The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines.","I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too.","Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do.","I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set.","Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad.",There is great expanse on ideas and passions in this idea run.,The first idea is to use MAX/MSP to create a sound to light interactive system.,The second idea is to create a theatre company that can reproduce the quality of theater performances here in america in countries without significant funding for musicals and theatre performances.,The third idea is to create new content for a musical play.,I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals.,It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.,"I found this classmates ideas interesting, but had difficulty understanding the details, and how their ideas would be accomplished.","In a week, this classmate would brainstorm and ask key questions about their project.",They are most interested in working on a project that connects sound and visuals.,"This classmate would like to create an infinite theatre, with an interactive component.",The theatre would involve state of the art equipment and take up an unlimited amount of space.,"In a semester, this classmate would create an interactive performance scene.",If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre.,"This idea sounded interesting, but I couldnŠ—Èt quite understand the details or picture the end result.","I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it.","The person has given thought to it, but doesnt describe the ideas quite enough.",The first idea is to create a graphic novel.,The second idea is to create a cartoon from the characters he/she has already created.,The third idea is is to ultimately create a graphic novel.,"All of the ideas have to do with either graphic novels or cartoons, so why not create a connection.",Make a book that has the cartoon within it.,"Create a book, then put a screen within it, and instead of having a regular graphic novel, the cartoon appears.","1) Graphic novel2) full cartoon3) Webcomic leading into graphic novel.",I would have liked more detail on each idea.,None of these are fleshed out enough for my liking.,"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper).",Like the pop-up book of the future.,I can see where this student was heading.,So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.,Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line.,We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.,"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media.",I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body.,I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology.,I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed.,"To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers.",These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester.,I just have NO idea of what this person is saying.,Read above.,The first idea would be to develop a 3d character.,The second idea is to develop a full length animation that is intense and far beyond a few month's capabilities.,The third one is to build upon your skills as an animator and develop something you're proud of.,"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself.",The student gave an honest and sincere effort and I believe gave some great answers.,The student clearly proposes three ideas in their post.,The first idea that the student proposes is essentially making a virtual character (which I think is really cool).,The second idea was also a digital animation idea on making a very detailed video game.,The last idea was about creating a digitally constructed visual.,If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.,DidnŠ—Èt go into much depth besides speaking of animation.,3D animation and psychology.,Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?,There are three ideas proposed with significant information for me to understand the ideas.,The first idea is to create a website or game.,The second idea is to create a virtual world with content that mirrors this world.,I love the idea of replicating an reliving historical time periods.,The third idea is to create a game with intelligent AI that can replicate a human player.,I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea.,One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses.,I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.,The larger proposed idea is the creation of an entire virtual world and simulator that would allow for the user to transport themselves anywhere.,The second idea is making a video game that centers around AI making it seem as if the computer's AI could be a human.,"The second idea is basically a smaller version of the first, larger idea.",I think that this student and I could work very well together.,"My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project.",All of your ideas seem to be based around developing some sort of game or program.,"It isn't that I don't find these ideas interesting, however what other projects might you be open to?","For example, with your second idea: Would you take it a step further and utilize the Oculus Rift headset?",I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to offer you much assistance with your project.,"Although I have some experience developing games and programming, I have a very limited knowledge on the subject.","However if you needed somebody to help craft something or to help develop character designs, I could be the man for the job.",The first idea is to do some programming for a video game.,The second idea is to create a very high end video game.,The third idea is to create a less high end video game than in idea 2.,We could make a videogame.,"This student made a very sincere effort and gave some very interesting answers, the student clearly proposed three ideas.",The first idea is about showcasing project mapping by using max msp.,The second idea is an interactive gaming system for children in hospitals that involves a digital environment.,"The last idea was creating a new way of playing video games that eliminates ""screen watching"".",If me and this student were assigned to collaborate together for the semester I would like to explore the possibilities of the students' last idea that involved a new way of playing video games with the cube that involves the first idea and some elements of the second idea.,It is very apparent that this person to the time and effort to sincerely answer all three idea questions.,They go into detail on what they exactly want to accomplish as well as what tools they would like to use for their project.,I could very easily get a picture in my head for each of their three concepts and thus believe they explained their points clearly and concisely.,"Their ideas: One Week: They wish to using projection mapping for either an art gallery or to show off their own line of clothing.",They would use Max msp to facilitate the projection mapping and would plan on using video.,Unlimited Time and Money: The wish to create a digital environment projection mapped into a room that children in hospitals and explore and play with using their hands or feet instead of controllers.,Realistic Semester: A cube that would not allow the transgression of video game screen looking to cheat when planing with friends.,This cube will have each player's perspective projection mapped on a different face making nigh impossible to catch a glimpse of what your friend in doing.,"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin.","The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides.","you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors.","I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture.","The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested.",You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers.,"This person has a major interest in projection mapping and interactive environments, this could be relatively easy to work with the appropriate direction and resource management.","Even if there is an inclusion of a clothing brand, the proposals are concise and clear.","My way-far-out-you-are-insane addition: let's make a completely projected room from the outside-in, possibly using something like four white cloth sheets and project a 3D space from outside and possibly add some sort of motion tracking mechanism with objects or the people.","My bound-to-earth proposal: yeah, let's do that.",You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do.,As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work.,"I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection.",I also like that you're thinking of working with kids.,"You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed.",The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping.,You might have to work with 2 different projectors.,I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea.,If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway.,Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.,"The student's first idea is to carve a unique wolf sculpture, idea two is vague but has an endgame of creating an emotionally evocative space for individuals, and lastly idea 3 is to create an installation.","I do not think that I could help out with project 1 in much of a way as I do not have any carving experience, but possibly I could assist in the formation of ideas 2 or 3.","The ideation seems pretty confident with project three so I think I could only assist in the actual physical construction of the installation, it doesn't seem like there would be much software involved.",In idea 3 I could possibly help in the ideation process and define a solid idea of what the implemented project actually will be.,This is the most well thought out and fully realized pitches for an idea I've read so far.,"The carving of a wolf sounds like a lot of fun, but also a lot of work.","The space installation sounds fascinating, especially the concepts being conveyed by the piece.",I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes.,She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.,They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas.,The first idea was to carve a hyper realistic figure of a wolf.,The second was to create some sort of environment that creates something eco-friendly.,The third was to create a frame to a viewer could see the light in some creative way.,The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique.,I would like to see something like that.,This student can definitely go different ways into what type of project he or she wants to do.,"However, I think that maybe he or she should stick to some sort of project that has to do with geometry or coding or both.","If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest focusing on a geometry oriented project.","The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there.",The first idea is to make a sculpture.,The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort.,"The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity.",I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly.,"The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough.","However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling.",I'm not really sure though.,Time travel has always been an interest of mine.,"That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool.","Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative.","I'm not sure exactly what we could work on, but it seems like we both have similar interests based on the responses (Twitch, gaming, time travel) so the ideas would definitely be alike.",This person shows really fun ideas that may or may not be simple but are interesting to see.,The ideas are quite clear with specific features.,"Their three ideas are simultaneous video game plays, virtual reality device that allows changes in the user's past, and an interactive display with a projection mapping of a mermaid.",The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended.,"I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen.","Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors.",The first idea was linking multiple consoles together to be able to play multiple video games from one console.,The second idea is to develop an alternate timeline device that would allow users to experience their lives if they made different decisions.,The third idea is to develop a virtual mermaid tank in which the mermaid would react dynamically to the environment.,I think we could take the last one and turn it into a project this semester.,The equipment is already easily available and it wouldn't be much of a stretch to bring this project to life with the correct sensors and programming.,I think these are some interesting ideas but they are a little over my head.,The first is for some Pokemon game but I'm not too familiar with Pokemon games but i like the idea of projecting older games onto surfaces to give them a new feel.,The second idea is for a alternate timeline which sounds cool but I'm confused how it would be executed.,The last is for an interactive mermaid projection which seems to react to sound and motion.,The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.,Would it be life size or smaller?,How would it work in a crowded room?,How many reactions would the mermaid have?,"All three responses are good ideas, even if idea #2 is currently technologically infeasible.",A setup that allows a player to play 5 simple games at once as an interesting experience.,A device that allows users to jump between timelines/ dimensions to try out different actions or choices in life.,A tank with a projection mapped mermaid inside that reacted to people in a room.,"I think that the mermaid tank idea is really interesting, though it would likely be rather difficult.","Making a prototype of this however could be feasible in a semester or two, where a smaller or simpler object or the skeleton of the mermaid model could be mapped into a special fish tank.",The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out.,"The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed.","The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices.","The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort.","As a game developer and programmer, I would be able to work with this student to create a game, given their lack of experience in programming.","However, 'create a game' is incredibly broad, as games vary greatly based on their genre and theme, so it's difficult to lay out what type of game we would make; I would need to know more about this student's interests and what their goal is for the game.",You'd like to make a stand to reduce the clutter of electronics.,"The problem with it is that there is stuff already kind of like that, and organizers already made.",If you do make it so that its all contained with in the nightstand it could be really neat and even marketable.,For your second idea I think solar energy would be your best bet because I'm not sure of how you could take energy from the body and transfer it into a battery.,"With this idea, any article of clothing could be used for quick energy which would be pretty neat.",The big problem I see is the lack of comfort from the clothing that you might get with attaching batteries and other things.,"People probably won't want to wear it if it's uncomfortable, especially if its hot.","The third Idea seems to be thought out, but I'm not sure what your concept is for the game.",If you're good with animation you might be able to make a trailer that would spark interest for programmers.,I think the biggest part before moving onto working with the occulus rift is to find that group to make your trailer and create a small part of the game.,"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it.","As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them.",I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well.,"Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable.",The student made a very good effort on his/her thoughts.,"All three ideas were detailed and gave the reader a good ideas as to what the student would want accomplished, and possible tools that would be used in order to accomplish their goals.","Reiteration of ideas:Idea 1 - Creating a model of a stand to hold all of his electronic devices and chargers by his bed to watch from.","Idea 2 - Creating wearable technology that is attached to the clothing that gathers solar, body heat, and kinetic energy, as a source of energy that could be stored into a battery.","Idea 3 - Creating a virtual reality game for the oculus rift, likely a first person shooter, that also uses a suit, fans, and other devices to simulate a more realistic experience.",I think part of his third idea would likely be a good choice for a semester/year long project.,A group of people would definitely be able to create a virtual world using Unity to create a simple first person shooter.,This project could possibly be taken even further depending on the time and try to incorporate the coding needed to make this game usable with the Oculus Rift.,The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.,The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.,"The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done.",The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting.,I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.,What is the end result?,How would you want people to feel?,What would the sculpture be or do?,"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something.","Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there.",I really like the arduino planting idea.,"I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world.",There are only two kind of vague ideas presented here.,The first is a garden that would take care of itself utilizing an Arduino to do the physical work.,The second is an interactive sculpture of some sort with no other details.,I think it would be feasible to build something like an interactive sculpture using sensors and computers to do the calculations and alter the sculpture.,The student put in a lot of time and effort into his/her ideas.,"Although these ideas are very detailed with what the student wants accomplished in the end, ideas 2 and 3 need more information as to what exactly Digital Culture students would be doing during the semester/year to apply their skills, aka, the ""engage and make it fun"" and ""find a way to expand"" needs work.",I do understand the overall goal but this needs more explanation as to what a group of 4 students would be doing exactly.,"Reiteration of ideas:Idea 1 - Complete composition of two songs for cinematic, game, or advertisement.",Idea 2 - Create campus ministries in all of the universities in America to establish relationships with the campus and business in the respective state.,Idea 3 - Build partnerships with organizations and expand The Respect Movement to other campuses.,"Since your first idea seems to show an interest in creating music, I think you could tie this in with ideas 2 and 3.","As an example, use the semester to create a song, maybe even a music video, to promote ideas 2 and 3.","This music video could use projectors, cameras, and software that the digital culture has available to students.",Your idea is very deeply thought out.,Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience.,I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about.,"Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion",I would be interested in seeing how far this project would go.,I want to see the process of this project campaign and how it is develop.,The ministry service is an project that look like it would grow by time not so sure about how big but I would like to contribute someway to see that project grows.,This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas.,This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students.,These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.,I am not at all that religious but I would do my best to help set up these clubs and organizations.,If they need an app or something I could help out and mix my idea into it but other than that I just don't see us collaborating.,The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do.,"Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture.",I do see potential in it though.,"Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea.",The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.,The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.,The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture.,I think that maybe we could tie in the songs with individuals and their need for equality.,"I guess what I am saying is that we could make an installation that scans someones face, then according to their structure or facial expression, it would create a song for that person.","Not sure if the second idea is really for the billion dollars if not simply use $100 and get away with $999'999,900 at hand, but hey, honestly I would like some of that cheddar too.","But I digress:This person has obvious interests in using projection mapping as a central thematic and makes absolute sense.","Except, again, for the eyebrow-raising budget of a billion dollars for a simple project like that.","I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity.",SO!,Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement.,"http://www.virtuix.com/Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside.","But I digress, I can sense something brewing.","The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona  sense of being in the POV of the character.",You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas.,I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto.,It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it.,I would like to go with the immersive environment animation because it coordinates well with my idea of make an immersive environment for sick children in a Child's Hospital.,"I feel if we made an animation sequence that can give the children a sense of POV of the character on their journey, that could greatly be helpful for them.","Since most of the children do not have access to such adventures, we could make an immersive environment that can give them a sense of adventure.","Also incorporate the clothing onto the child so say the child is a knight on a quest, the immersive environment would be projected onto the surrounded and a knight's outfit or armor can be projected onto the clothing of the child to really give them the POV of the character.",These projects seem to be well thought out considering the constraints.,The first is for a simple projection mapping on an object.,The second is for a wearable system that communicates with projector some how to trigger different displays.,"The last is for a animation that gives the viewer two different perspectives, I think this would be interesting but might be complicated.",I would help this artist to consider the time involved in animating because they would be making two animations which is going to eat up some time especially if they want to work in 3D.,I would also hope they had some ideas on what the character looked like or the environment they character would be in because I would want to get started on the animations as soon as possible.,"The student I believe did give a sincere and to the point answer with their ideas, the student also clearly proposed three things.",The first idea that the student spoke of was mapping animations on to objects and using the object's shape as a way of increasing the visual effects of the animations.,The second idea was mapping and tracking clothing on individuals and using it for artistic purposes.,The last idea was creating a projection that allows the user to step inside the object being projected on and view the shots from the characters point of view.,With these three ideas I believe that me and this student could work on some cool mapping project that uses the artistic aspects the student spoke of in the third idea to make a really cool visual experience for the viewers.,Idea number one doesn't seem like much of an idea.,It seems like this student is saying they would just spend the week brainstorming.,Ideas 2 & 3 both have to do with getting clean water to those around the world who need it most.,"They also seem like the same idea, just in different words.","I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute.",Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort.,The student said he/she will prepare enough before doing a project.,Finding a way to clean water.,Like to clean the rain water.,To build prototypes about collect water from the atmosphere.,The ideas are great.,The steps of making a one-week project are organized.,But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.,"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required.","In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process?","In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes.","Reiteration of ideas:Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project.","Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy.",Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers.,Your ideas reminded me of the LifeStraw (http://www.buylifestraw.com/).,This technology allows people around the world to filter contaminated water and allow it to be instantly drinkable through a straw.,"I think in a semester or two, a group of students could take a LifeStraw, and build on it even more somehow.","Maybe use the same technology to where, instead of drinking from a straw, make a fast and easy way to clean and store this water instead for later usage.",I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building.,We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water.,For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea.,The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington.,If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.,I would definitely partner up on this project since it is about a subject that is very important in life and for society to have clean running water is very important.,Yes this student made a sincere effort to explain their ideas.,One of their projects was about scanning magic cards and projecting some type of holographic image.,The other was to make a portfolio of all the work they have completed and also a short animation film.,"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea.",I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going.,Idea 1 is to make a stop motion video using action figures.,Idea 2 is create an interface that would allow magic cards to become 3D mapped on to the field.,Idea 3 is create a portfolio of all the artwork and projects they have created.,"I really like the Magic idea, at the moment the streams of Magic Invitationals are rather boring but adding in the spectacle of the 3D rendering could really ramp up the entertainment.",Three things were pretty clearly proposed.,"The stop-motion idea is intriguing, as is the holograph-magic card idea (even if it's a little derivative of the yugi-oh anime).",And the portfolio development sounds like a really awesome idea.,"I'd love to collaborate on any of these projects, Doing concept sketches of possible characters for the magic cards, or helping to sculpt creatures for the stop-motion animation sound awesome.",spending a semester working with other artists and collaborating on creating our individual portfolios and having that input from other artists sounds so beneficial.,This person made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas.,The first was to create a stop motion film.,The second was to create an interface that scans and 3D prints magic cards.,The third was to generate a personal portfolio.,I like the idea of creating an interface that would create 3D prints of magic cards.,"Ever since I was little when I use to collect pokemon cards and yugioh cards, I always thought it would be amazing if they had something that I could scan my cards with and that would put them into a game or something.",To this day they don't really have anything like that as far as for card games.,I know they have Skylanders which sort of does the same thing but for action figures.,This entry suggests a website that builds on the great commercial success of JK Rowling's series of books and movies.,The interaction by the reader with the capability of creating their pathway is enticing for people.,There is a lot of excess verbiage; it sounds like an ad for Pottermore.,"Your description needs to show more objectiveness, like someone just talking about it not someone excitedly looking forward to it.",This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.,It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan  world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions.,Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books?,"In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on  a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria.",Interesting choice of future book.,The strengths of your entry are in the wide variety of uses for blogs as well as examples for them.,"You have done a lot of research, and it shows.","The blog meets the challenge of future book by being a never ending, ever-evolving work of text contributed to by many.",You have a lot of examples in your entry.,"If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better.",Wow!,Those are quite the concepts for reading in the future.,You have listed a variety and their uses today and in the time to come.,I do not think the history of writing or the technology based readers is needed nor are the steps technology has made in computers.,They make no difference to the system you are discussing.,I think if you keep your description to factual based reporting of the systems it will work better in the guide.,There is a lot of information there.,Reddit appears to be an ever expanding source of information.,If this is so then it meets the challenge like the blog.,I wonder if Reddit has everything like you state.,How is the information validated?,Are there actual books there or is it just blogs and just used for information look up?,Your guide is slightly confusing to me if you could clarify I would appreciate it.,"Anything Star Wars is an automatic win in my book, and I'm all for retro feels.","The physical description of the book and its contents is clear, and taking the reader through the steps of how the images change is helpful to understand what makes this book special.","Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition.",Fantastic description of the capabilities and (likely endless) possibilities of tumblr.,Thorough representation of how you feel tumblr is changing the face of books/lit related media and the features available to bloggers.,I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post.,"Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?","Excellent description of the features, functionality, and purpose of Pottermore website.","I had heard of it before, but always considered it to be a stagnant wiki for the Potter 'verse.",It was enlightening to know that Rowling continues to participate.,I think your description of how this is part of the future of books was laid out well using this specific example.,"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary.",Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used?,"Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter"".","Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen"".",Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?,Excellent fact backup and mini-history of audio-blogging/podcasting.,"Section 3 is well thought out and highlights the pitfalls of a physical printing process, while underscoring the viability of podcasts as a literary medium.","Bonus points for the use of ""bourgeois"".",Consider adding html links to research citations and the 99% Invisible podcast.,"This line confused me: ""Pew Research reports that in the past 30 years the levels of individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled.""",What are these people not doing?,Consider revising wording to make this reference clear.,Completed assignment on time.,I encountered several run-on sentences throughout the assignment.,This made it difficult to follow the author's arguments.,Consider revising and parsing arguments out into a more centralized format.,"Additionally, incorrect word usage (""is becoming more patience"", ""provides the reader to"", ""as oppose to a book"", etc) made it extremely difficult to assimilate the author's meaning.",What a great example!,I had no idea what to write about in my description and think that you chose the perfect media.,You've provided a ton of information in your 300 word allotted space.,"There definitely isn't much ""fluff""- you get down to business from the start.","I wish I had a better grasp of what this technology is, as I then think that this would be an extremely informative explanation.",Your knowledgable of this type of media is apparent in your description and I learned something new by reading your assignment.,You seem confident in your prediction of the future of the book and readers of your assignment cannot deny the contagiousness of your excitement.,"Having no idea what an ""augmented reality reading experience"" is, your summary only confused me!",Maybe somehow include in that initial summary that this product's purpose is to deliver a 3D reading and viewing experience.,"That is the point of this technology, correct?","Also, the following sentence is confusing:  ""At this time, it is an iPhone or iPad but there is an Android version under development.""","I ran into many of these ""for instances"" and kept having to reread sections of your assignment.",It was choppy to me and a hard read.,"There are numerous run on sentences and a plethora of facts but not enough explanation.Perhaps my best advice to you, as someone who has never heard of such a technology, is to reread your assignment and pretend you're in my shoes.",Good luck!,Your summary is great - straightforward and provides the necessary information to understand your idea of the future of books.,You chose a very interesting subject matter and I'm excited to check out www.postsecret.com in my free time.,Your 300 word description is extremely clear and easy to follow.,The time that you spent working on this assignment is apparent.,"You gave a great description of the book itself and allowed your readers to have a grasp of your personal experience with the book and how it changed the way you My favorite line of your description is the following:  ""The book is colorful and dark, emotional and boring, fantastic and dull.""","I love the following line as well:  ""What makes this book a Š—“futureŠ— book is that it doesnŠ—Èt have a single author.","It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight than an actual book.""","I wouldn't have linked this book with the ever-popular social media world, but your point is great and so true.","Overall, I don't think that your assignment needs much revising.",You did a great job with the rough draft and looks more like a final draft to me than a rough draft!,I look forward to reading and critiquing your future assignments for this course!,The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts.,I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts.,"If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment.",I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.,"I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence:  ""What makes this book a Š—“futureŠ— book is that it doesnŠ—Èt have a single author.","It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book.""",You gave a great summary of the work that you chose to be the future of books.,Your quick snippet of a description is clear and purposeful.,Your readers have a great grasp on what they are about to read in your description.,"I love that you included a link in your description and have every intention on visiting the website in my free time to learn more about ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag"".",My favorite sentences of your assignment were the following:  Š—“'Click-Clack the RattlebagŠ— is a book in name only.,"Its text is entirely invisible, you see: invisible like ghosts.","And thus, aesthetically, Š—“Click-ClackŠ— is a work of art presented entirely in vocal narrative.""","As a reader, you definitely got me interested in the media that you chose to explore and the eerie ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag"".",I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks!,"That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique.","In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner.",Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback.,Wow!,I absolutely love that you included a picture with your summary.,It made your assignment come alive and was obviously the first thing that I noticed when I clicked on the title of your work.,"Not only did you include a picture, but it's a very interesting picture!","Just by reading your summary, I got super curious as to what experiencing ""touch"" would be like on pottermore.com.",I didn't know such a website existed about the Harry Potter series but am not surprised!,I only read a couple of the Harry Potter books (I've never been much into fiction) but am curious and excited to explore the website.,It's great that you included the link within your writing.,"Your excitement of this media is apparent in your writing, and definitely string along your readers to read through your whole assignment.","I love how you mentioned that the pottermore.com crashed during it's initial release, that you insist that this website is just ""that cool.""","I love that you realized the following:  ""While it is not a replacement for the tome-like books, it brings a flair that is impossible to experience with paper alone.""",(My assignment is based on this idea as well.),"I think my favorite line of your assignment was the following:  ""If this website could be neatly bound, pressed, and fitted with a dust jacket, it might be the most perfect book of the future.""","You realize that even though the website is super cool, there is still a need for tangible bound books.",I agree!,"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision.","You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated.","If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?",Great work.,"I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!","I had a hard time finding the strengths of your assignment, as I don't think that you followed the assignment prompt.","After reading and rereading your writing, I'm not clear as to what you think the future book will look like.","I understand that you've done some family history research and plan on passing it down to your children and your children's children via digital photography and writing, though I have no idea about what you think the future of books will be.","Please see my constructive criticism below, as I think that your rough draft needs some major rewriting.",Your summary isn't very clear.,"My first suggestion would be to rewrite this portion of the assignment and be straightforward, not leaving anything to be guessed or assumed.","The purpose of a summary is to tell the reader exactly what they are about to read, not to leave them wondering what your subject matter is and what they're about to get involved with.","Of the five assignments I've read, yours needs the most amount of revision in my opinion.","I'm not exactly sure how to approach your writing, as I kind of think the whole thing needs to be rewritten.","The assignment was to decide on what the future of the book will be and give a 300 word explanation of it, followed by why you think that society is leaning in the direction of your chosen mode of literary media.","To me, your assignment just seems to tell of how you've done some research on your family history.","Perhaps you should read through the assignment prompt again, as I think that you may have been confused as to what we were supposed to write about.","Maybe I'm so wrong and I've completed the assignment incorrectly, but mine follows the same guidelines as the other four I've just critiqued.","I hope you don't find my response as rude, would just rather tell it to you straight as you have an opportunity to fix your assignment before you turn in the final draft - that's a good thing!","The entry specifically points to the book's uniqueness, in that it is not necessarily just an e-book or a website; it is her brand.",This meets the assignment's challenge by being both specific and creative by finding a book that is very atypical.,"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately.","Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book.","I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more.",Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world.,How is she innovative?,"If it's not just a cookbook, explain why.",The future factor explanation is very well done.,"I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would.","By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book.","This entry did not find a specific book, but instead wrote about a hypothetical one.","The main challenge is to think of books creatively, but this does not pinpoint something that I can actually go out and see for myself.","I would suggest trying to find a hybrid-type book, or at least something that could become hybrid very easily.","This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader.","It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books.","By not giving a real example of such a book, this entry is not completed.","While the exact book the author speaks of may not yet exist, an example should still be found, per the assignment.",The author should find something that is similar so that I can at least see what they're talking about a little more clearly.,Using a PostSecret book is a great choice.,"It is compiled of thousands of people's work, making it a unique, collaborative project (that, somehow, still keeps its secrets).","The explanation of the future factor is spot on: it is a blog in a book, and surely a medium that will evolve into something great.","Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it.","While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?","The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states.","It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing.","Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling.","Perhaps add more written examples in the middle section, creating an overall convincing entry.","I really like how you pointed out, in the beginning of your explanation, that you do not think books will ever die.","I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information.","It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to Š—…disappearŠ—È into their own world.","This being said, you make an excellent point in stating that film is very relatable as it is easy to SEE another individual, and thus experience aspects of their lives with them.",I also think you did a very good job explaining the film and in explaining the intrigue and the value in its genre as a documentary.,"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text"".","I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination.","The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer.","I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text.","Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go.","But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story.","I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true.","But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!",I agree with you that sites such as tumblr are growing to be exponentially popular.,"In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories.","Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster.","I think that many people who use tumblr use the site for the exact purpose of discovering and connecting to other people's posts, opinions, and self-created work.","The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work.","In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people.","This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves.","While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post.","In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work?","If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?","Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go.","If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it.",It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post.,"In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living.","Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series?","In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it?","This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute.","This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free.",Just a thought!,I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!,I think you did an excellent job of building up this book.,"You made the book seem very intriguing, exciting, and above all, futuristic.","I have no idea how you managed to include pictures, but the pictures certainly did an amazing job of enhancing the work and proving your overall point.","Through viewing the photos alone, and without reading any of your text, I got the feel that this book is incredibly different than other 'traditional' books, and in this I think you absolutely met the challenge of this assignment.","I think that, in your final draft, your photos will do an outstanding job at proving your point.","In addition to this, your writing was well-thought out, properly organized, and succeeded in dynamically building up the book you chose.",Great work!,"I honestly do not believe you need to embellish upon your original draft before it is finalized; your work was clear, concise, and to the point, as well as implanting an interest and an intrigue in not only the work you described, but also in a genre of books that follows the style of your chosen work.","I wouldn't change anything to this draft, so good job!","I do agree that websites such as Reddit are not only very popular now, but will also continue to be popular in the future.","People want a way to interact with one another, and also want to find individuals who share certain interests.","As you said, it is not just text that is used on Reddit, but also pictures.","In addition, people can also bring in other information to help others out or to just share interesting experiences, and I think that people of todayŠ—Ès generations and in future generations really enjoy that autonomy in writing and reading.","The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one canŠ—Èt really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land.","For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing.","For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge Š—– because there was another universe that readers could disappear into.",IŠ—Èm not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit Š—– but your post didnŠ—Èt really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds.,"I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future.","For instance, if you said something akin to the following,  Š—“instead of authors publishing books through  a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this websiteŠ—, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites.",I believe that this description of the Role-Playing book was sufficient in answering the prompt questions.,"In addition, the OP made the Role Playing book seem exciting, challenging, and subjective to one's decisions and preferences, which many individuals will most certainly enjoy.","The book is also not limited, it seems, to a physical, hand-held book, and can also be read and 'played' on e-devices, making it accessible from many different locations and in many different ways.","The reader will be in control of the outcome of the ending, which can be a delightful experience for many individuals who prefer this type of book.",I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages.,"Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both.",How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website?,"Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered?",Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device?,"While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all.","Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!","The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions.","For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short.",My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore.,"For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not?","How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all?","Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?","The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly.","While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested.",The article is very well written and gives the reader a good understanding of the nature of the Pottermore website.,"Adding the detail about the site crashing on launch is also a great way to show that it's not just the author who feels positive about this sort of continuation of printed works in the digital realm, as is comparing it to other popular social media.",The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website.,"Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?","The author does an excellent job of both describing the material, making it sound almost irresistible to readers, and explaining why this book exemplifies how technology will shape the future of the book.",Providing the link to the material in question is also quite nice.,"It's a bit nitpicky, but ""I have selected"" is hardly necessary here.",It would far more effectively to cut that out and stick with the basic summary of the work.,"The article is very well-rounded and addresses many valid points about blogs and how they reflect the changing nature of writing online, publishing online, and the closer interactions between reader and writer.","Describing a specific blog, rather than just describing the medium in general, would probably be a better way of showcasing the nature of the blog.","However, if the author chooses to continue with simply talking about blogs in general, linking to specific blogs and blogging platforms would be a good way to showcase the diversity mentioned here, rather than just assuring the audience that it exists.","""Annarasumanara"" is a Korean variation on the many Japanese web-based, comic-book style stories that grew out of the Manga and Anime and comics of a few decades ago and that have now become rendered as graphically enhanced software that can be displayed on computer screens.","The strength of this entry is that it does demonstrate an important aspect of the continuing evolution of books by showing us an example of one segment of the ""reading pool"" that is now making the transition from print to digital format.","This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond.","For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future.","In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point.",This is quite an interesting interpretation of the intent of this assignment.,"Using DNA testing as a way to build a historical thread that can possibly reveal long-lost relatives from the past, or perhaps uncover historical facts about people that might help to strengthen filial bonds (or not!)",certainly identifies an application of a current technology (genetic and genome analysis) that can be used in a very positive way.,"And the translation of the data collected into electronic formats will make it more likely that information converted from printed and pictorial media will be stored in a centralized place, with a reasonably high chance surviving for a very long time.","You seem to be agreeing, then, that the eventual transformation of knowledge and information, including books, from the printed formats of today to more digitized forms is not only occurring, but will continue to happen until one day nearly all of our reading interactions will take place through a human-machine, electronic interface.",One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified.,It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide.,"The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years.","Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations.","As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!","This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment.",In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe.,Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything.,This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!,"Since a good example has been found that demonstrates a current trend in the timeline of 'book technology' (past, present, and future), In working toward a final draft, the author should not forget to provide a back drop to Tumblr, perhaps by describing more about what lead to Yahoo's acquisition of this technology, provide some more details about Tumbler itself (images, descriptions), and to speculate on where this technology could be leading us and how it will impact the continuing evolution of the book.","References to course readings would also be a plus, if applicable.","Kali's selection of ""Night Film"" for her entry for the field guide is presented very well and the embedded images provide visuals that help the reader understand the unusual characteristics of this book.","Although scores of other authors have incorporated illustrations, graphs, images, codes, and other visual devices to enhance the reader's experience in 'living' the story, the merging of information that provides the reader with links and other interfaces to the Internet, the importance this additional information has to the story lines and the need to download an external decoder, while possibly annoying to some readers, is in itself an example of how the current technology of the book  is using the wonders of the digital age in incorporating some of its interfaces as an integral part of the book.",Kali's obvious skill at presenting ideas and information -- as her adeptness in articulating opinions in our discussion posts has already been demonstrated -- will be an advantage as she further develops the idea she has proposed in this first draft of her field guide.,"Hopefully, she will also include some thoughts on how the techniques used by Pessl in ""Night Film"" will evolve as the technologies for interacting with data  and ideas (particularly 3-dimensional) progress to the point in which readers feel more like travelers through a parallel universe -- feeling the same sensations experienced by characters in the story -- than outsiders looking in.","This is another good example of a book that uses current digital technology to enhance a reader's interactive experience (in this case, a children's book designed to be read on an iPad using iBooks as the e-reading application.","Although printed books have provided an excellent medium to display vivid illustrations and bright colors for children, it is not until books began to be digitized and designed to be read on electronic reading devices that animations, voices, and movement -- all of which greatly enhance a child's interaction with a story -- that features such as the author has described are now possible.","Selecting a children's book in demonstrating possible directions for the future of books provides ample room to speculate on what may be in the realm of possibility within the next decade and, indeed, within the next century.","As mentioned in other critiques, and as this idea continues to be refined, some thought should be spent on the possibility of describing the history of book technology and in providing suggestions for where our digital reading technology is taking us.","To be sure, printed books have been a critical factor in the advancement of mankind, but I think it would be nice to read more about some of the differences between what some of us may have experienced as children and what amazing options are for the children of today.","Extend this into the future, and the possibilities become quite exciting indeed!",It does show how things we did in the past are now improved or changed as a result of technological advances.,I clearly understand the point the author is making and the writing is clearly thought-out.,"The field guide attempts to show the ability that technology has to instantly document our lives and save that documentation forever, without fear of it being lost due to some physical destruction.",The problem is we spend most of the field guide learning about the authors time his/her brother uploaded their DNA online in order to map back potential members of their gene pool.,"While this is interesting it seems to fall short of the assigned task of finding a (a real book, object, publication, real or virtual thing), not something made up.",The field guide closely follows the prompt and finds a new type of way to engage with books through some sort of future or new technology.,The guide explains the process of emerging existing texts into a more immersive reality and has made me want to download the app on mu iPhone.,"In the future factor section, the field guide slips away from the pragmatic approach taken in the description and delves into an area of more idealizing than explaining this thing in the desired technical manner.","Kudos for using futuristic implementations into the field guide, like the hyperlink to News from Gardenia's Unbound site and the picture.",The Field Guide does well to sell its audience on News from Gardenia which is a book about the possibility of a utopian future.,"The author of the guide accurately and with concise but important detail, gives an accurate description of the thing they are writing on.","Though Unbound, the crowdsourcing platform for book publishing is really the futuristic aspect of the guide we only hear about it once we get to the last section.",Instead of describing News from Gardenia so thoroughly we should be getting a description of how Unbound will change the future of text.,The field guide describes Reddit very well and points out all the aspects of Reddit that make it something that answers the prompt's questions.,The field guide creates even for someone who knows nothing about Reddit a well thought out description enabling them to use the site.,"While the Field Guide explains Reddit very well and enables the user of the guide to navigate the site with ease, its claims that Reddit is the future of books is a bit short sighted.","While Reddit may be the future of DIY, self-help and information/resource based books, it will have a hard time treading in the rivers of fiction.",Fiction is a huge aspect of books and text still and the Reddit community and the way the site is constructed would struggle in attempting to improve the fiction universe.,The selected thing from which the Field Guide is created follows the prompt perfectly.,The description in the field guide explains what has changed in the books adaptation and these changes are a result in new technologies and advancements made.,I would really think of new ways in which ebooks can change like the way the one described in the field guide did.,Instead of assuming that mainly a transition from paper to electronic format is all that will happen.,Fill your future factor section with more of what you think is a possibility of the ebook.,The technologies described definitely seem to provide a more immersive experience for the reader.,"Especially ""Alice,"" with its ability to provide a previously unheard of level of interactivity with the story itself.",The selections point toward an emerging technology meant to work with the existing book itself to make it something new.,"It meets the challenges of the assignment by detailing how these products enhance the reading experience in a variety of ways (social, interactive, and reviews).","It also hints toward how these technologies might be expanded upon in the future, to further change the reading experience.",The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book.,It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book.,Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system.,It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.,"This entry very effectively describes the ergodic text, ""House of Leaves,"" and how it utilizes unorthodox methods of story-telling to give voice to several characters.",The features detailed make the prospect of reading a text of such innovative design very enticing.,It is representative of how certain authors are now bushing the limitations of the traditional book to tell stories in a way few could have previously imagined.,I do not believe this entry falls short.,It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future.,"I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book.","I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future.","However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard.",It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format.,It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique.,Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium.,"In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book.","Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either.","A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook.","This sounds like an amazing companion to one of the, if not the, most popular book series' in history.",The Harry Potter series enjoyed immense popularity before it ever graced a movie screen.,There are few modern series' that have managed to hold the public attention in such large numbers for seven books and eight film adaptations.,I can only imagine how immersive and how much fun this site would be for a Harry Potter fan.,I think this description really gives the reader a sense of the level of content on the site.,As well as several examples of the interesting and creative content they can expect to find when they visit it.,"For an fan, after reading that description, I can only imagine that their next stop would be Pottermore.com.",It is not made clear in the description if this resource can be used by someone reading the book for added effect to their reading experience or if it is simply intended that more condensed and interactive ebooks/websites will eventually replace books.,"I do not agree with the comment about ""the perfect book for the Twitter generation"".",Such books and short versions of full-length texts already exist.,An old example would be the novelization of the death of Superman and his eventual return.,"Roger Stern was tasked with novelizing the most popular comic book story arc in the history of the medium, titled ""The Death and Life of Superman"".","It was so popular that DC Comics produced a more condensed novelization for younger readers, titled ""Superman: Doomsday and Beyond"" by Louise Simonson.","Generally, readers go to books for a greater depth of information and storytelling, which they find immersive.",It is usually film adaptations that go the more condensed route.,"I don't se how such an innovation could actually replace the modern book, until they provide the same level of information and storytelling, as well a similar practicality of use.",Fair warning: This is my second review about this site.,"I feel this description did a very good job of highlighting the social features of the site and the additional literary content, in the form of fan fiction and the small additions from Rowling, which would definitely be a draw for any die hard Harry Potter fan.",Combined with the continual development of additional story content in the games and the ability to stay in contact with J.K. Rowling herself.,It definitely appears that Pottermore.com would be the number one place to go to immerse one's self in the Harry Potter universe.,"There is no clear connection to the idea that this is an evolution of the book, or something bound to replace the book.",It is a website.,"A very in-depth site with many features, but it is still not a place where on can go and read the seven official Harry Potter texts or an innovation that delivers those stories in another way but in the same depth.","It is a great resource for fans, but it is still reliant on the existence of the books, in basically their traditional form, one which to build this universe.",I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text.,There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered.,Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future.,This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.,"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters.",This entry goes in depth to explore how podcasts offer the same experience of reading a book but with the added benefit of being able to multi-task.,"It effectively explains what a podcast is, who uses them, and why they are important.",It also uses several very specific examples to strengthen its assertions.,The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there.,There is truly a podcast for everybody.,This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts.,"I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests.","This is an extremely well-written entry, with enough excellent description to make anybody want to read (or here, listen to) this story.","It highlights a very relevant piece, one which blends the custom of stories with the ""second orality"" we are focusing on.","The writer of this entry appeals to ""the illiterate and the bibliobibuli alike,"" stating the advantages of such a form of literature in the modern world.",A great entry!,"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it.",This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to.,This is a very interesting take on the future of the book -- the focus on an interactive future is exciting.,I think this entry presents an excellent argument for the futuristic digitalization of literature.,It effectively describes the benefits of such technology and why it is an important option for our literary future.,"I think this entry could spend a little less time describing less relevant things (i.e., the first paragraph of the second section) and focus instead on simply and succinctly describing some of the features of Ideo.","It would be interesting to have a quick summary of the features offered by the Nelson, Coupland, and Alice concepts.",This would allow for further exploration of the specific benefits of each feature as they relate to different potential readers.,"This entry wonderfully blends the arts of printed books and digital media, must like the subject itself.","It is clear that the writer supports the idea of digital media as an enhancer of printed text, rather than a complete replacement, which is something I completely relate to.","This entry effectively describes the content of the story without being over-revealing, and it describes the ways in which the story is a glimpse into the future of literature.",I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment.,I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.,"I think this entry very effectively describes what makes ""Annarasumanara"" different from other e-texts, and therefore a ""future"" book rather than one we already know.",The author picks out a specific characteristic of this web comic (the noticeably different format and disregard to the uniformity consistent with other web comics) to distinguish it from others and propose it as a futuristic text.,"It also gives readers an idea of what the web comic is about, and makes us curious to know more about the characters and story line.","The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story.","I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here.","I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary.","But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!",Great choice of film!,"I love the documentary Babies, and I think you hit upon its main unique strength here in a very eloquent way.","Rather than use text at all to communicate its message, it relies specifically on non-verbal cues and images throughout the film.","I really like how you mention that if you glance away for a moment, you can miss a part of the story, as that is very true for that film and for so many social cues which are non-verbal.","I think this brings up all sorts of great questions, because if this film is a sort of future book it seems more a type of oral culture than literary culture.","Indeed, it would seem that almost all documentary films are, in a way, more a throwback to an oral culture than literary culture.",I think you've hit on an interesting idea here.,"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner.",#NAME?,Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves.,--their needs to be they are or they're.,"""Film will always be more powerful than text.""","This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement.","Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why.","Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film.","But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form.","It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point.","Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book.","So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is.","I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section.","Oh, also I believe you need a pic!",Somewhere in there.,"There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online.","Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic?",That might give readers the best idea of the film.,"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose.","Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing.","I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!","I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom.","You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it.","They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel?","So in several ways, you've found a very unique book.",I also appreciate that you are concise.,"In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself.","Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother?","Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there.","""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible.""","--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that.",That authors name has so many L's!,"I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on.","I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest.","I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that.","Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers.""","Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear.","The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right?","So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future?",Does that make sense?,"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent.","I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment.",So here is where I know this is happening.,"James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?)","I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game.","Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?","I think you need to pick a single specific book or other media source in existence today (game, choose your own adventure book) and describe that.",I'm sure there is something out there that fits your description.,"You mention Phantasy Star in your summary, so if you choose to focus on that, I think your title should explain Phantasy Star, your description should explain Phantasy Star, etc.",I gave examples of the Role Playing Book above that I could think of off the top of my head but the book that has always reminded me of a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel is Italo Calvino's If on a winter's nite a traveler... so you may also want to check that one out?,"You don't choose your own path in it, but you, as the reader, are written into the book.","Also, I think you could compare Choose Your Own Adventure Novels to hyperlinks on the internet.","Really, when we browse the internet, we are choosing our own adventure with each click.","Instead of flipping to a different page in the book, we are moving to a different web page online.","But until you focus on a single item, I don't think this assignment is done correctly.","Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented!",Very cool.,"I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory.","I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention.","I was so interested in this that I looked it up online, and it looks like you took some of your info and text ""The team looked at how digital and analog books currently are being read, shared and collected, as well as at trends, business models and consumer behavior within related fields.""",straight from their website?,Bummer.,"It is important not to do this, as you will for sure get in trouble for it.","If you have any other cut/copied text in there, get it out of there because Prof. Finn said he would run this through plagiarism software and it will catch this.","What you want to try to do is read the web page, think about the information and process it, but say it in a completely different way.","Or if you still want to say it in exactly that way, you need to attribute it to the web page.","I think this is a lot to write about, as it sounds sort of overwhelming and complicated as three different book-related technologies.","To me, it would be more digestible to just approach it from Alice, since you said that was the more interesting one.","That way, there may be less pressure to summarize so much of what the company is doing, and it might be easier to just explain the technology of Alice itself?","Wow, the technologies I've critiqued thus far are crazy.","I had no idea the ""future"" of the book was so advanced!","This is a great choice of technology to feature, as it is obviously right on the pulse of the future.","I like how you mention the possibilities with children quite a bit, as I think that is important, I know many children who already use iPads as reading tools and I can definitely see this as a possibility in the future.","You also managed to explain everything in an eloquent way, there weren't any grammar errors in your writing that I could find, so great job on that as you are talking about some complicated tech topics here.","I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works.",Are there glasses?,What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now?,The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad?,I point my iPad at a picture?,"Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture?","I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me.","Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality.","I pick up my iPad, and then what happens?","Is there text on the screen, or only pictures?",What are QR codes?,"I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world.",Just walk them through the experience.,I'm a fan of making things really simple.,"And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle?","So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something.",The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from  the internet.,"It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it.","I think that the entry fell short on providing more reasoning as to why it will be a future book, and I would suggest to explain more about it.",The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book.,It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.,"I think that the entry falls short in the reader not understanding the reason this book can be the future book, It give the reader many explanation about but not very well convincing.",I think that it needs to be more convincing as to why this can be a future cook.,The reader gets a full understanding of what is being describe to be the future book.,It meets the challenge of the assignment because it is explained and gives a good knowledge about why the role playing game and choose your own adventure game can be the future book.,I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book.,I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.,I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook.,It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.,I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince.,"The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed.",The strengths can be found in that there was a lot of good detail information to why the digital book is the future.,It met the challenge of the assignment in proving reasons as to how the digital books will be the future books due to modern technology.,I think that the entry did not fall short and the reader was convinced that the digital books and society adapting to modern technology will enhance the demand to want digital books.,I think maybe explain his question at the end.,The author certainly supports that podcasts are a way forward for creative works.,There are a number of outside sources within the Field Guide that support the idea that podcasts and recorded audio work in general could surpass the written word as a way to consume both fiction and non-fiction.,"First of all, there are certainly some typographical errors that are easily corrected, such as ""individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled.""","I assume that is meant to read ""over the age of 18 who do not READ has doubled"".",I believe that this field guide would also benefit from more focus.,"Rather than focus on the technology of podcasts or audioblogging, I would like to see how a specific podcast functions and demonstrates the way forward.","The author does mention one work, ""99% Invisible"", but it is given as an example of the form rather than being the focus of the field guide.","This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response.","Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent.","While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc.",don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment.,I believe the primary changes that need to be made are in organization.,"Focus on a single work, demonstrate how the form is superior (or at least the way forward) and finally why this constitutes the future of the book.",The author does an excellent job in summarizing the appeal of the novel itself.,"In addition, the way the book is created, with crowdsourced financing and increased interaction between audience and author, is a compelling way forward for future publications.","I may be wrong in this assessment, but I believe that the ""description"" aspect of the assignment was to be less focused on the content of the novel and more on what makes the novel different from other novels.","As the author notes, the content itself isn't unique in that sense.","I would suggest refocusing the ""description"" on the process of the publication, rather than the content.","That way, it would clear-up plenty of space in the ""Future Factor"" section to discuss how this process shows us a way forward in the future of the book.","The author does an excellent job at describing the uniqueness of the work itself, as well as the visual style of the art.",The ability to alter or eliminate the restrictions of the printed page is well-explained in how the work takes advantage of the lack of limitation in electronic form.,"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders"".","There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically.","Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works.","There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media"".",A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful.,"Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful.",This field guide entry does an excellent job in explaining Tumblr and how it can be used by authors and artists to distribute their craft.,"It also demonstrates how this can be effective in a changing electronic landscape, incorporating both multiple forms of media and reader-response into an ongoing product.","In this case, the author focuses on a technology, rather than a specific work.","I believe that to properly fulfill the assignment, the guide should be refocused on a particular work that uses Tumblr as the medium, and use examples from that work to demonstrate how Tumblr is different from other mediums.","While one author is mentioned as an example, the field guide would be stronger if it were focused on the work, rather than the technology.",The author does an excellent job focusing on a single work and expanding on the method that work uses in order to demonstrate how this can be used for a variety of works.,"Each aspect of the expanded website is well-explained and clear, and it's easy to see how this is a useful tool to expand the world of the novel.",I have very few criticisms of this work.,"Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction.","For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?",I love the way you portrayed the ongoing relationship a blog can establish between author and reader in the Š—“Future FactorŠ— section and how it differs from that of a novel.,"You did a great job in your description as well, and made a compelling case as to why a blog can be considered a Š—“future book.Š—",My only critiques are grammatical ones.,"In your summary you said Š—“people can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry.Š— You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry.","Then, in your description, when you said Š—“to skydive out of a plain,Š— plain should be plane.",ThatŠ—Ès all I got :) great job!,You did an excellent job with this assignment.,Your descriptions were very clear and you made a compelling case as to why Pottermore is a Š—“future book.Š— I had never heard of it and you made me want to go check it out myself.,You have a great tone to your writing that made your entry enjoyable to read.,"I love your last line and the idea of technology as a tool to Š—“feedŠ— the fans, great imagery (and very accurate I believe).",Fans are always hungry for more and are constantly searching for new ways to feed that hunger.,"Technology offers a great way for fans to connect with the author, as well as other people who have the same interests.",My only critique is a grammatical one.,"In the description when you said Š—“A animated and interactive telling of the books,Š— a should be an.",ThatŠ—Ès it :) great job!,I loved your entry!,It was thoughtful and very creative.,You have a great tone that makes your writing enjoyable to read.,"I loved the way you described the aesthetics of the book, invisible like a ghost.",I also liked that you included GaimanŠ—Ès Halloween gift-giving tradition.,That history gives the work more solidity.,You did a great job in your description and made me want to go download it immediately.,"You also made a compelling case as to why this is a Š—“Future Book.Š— Bibliobibuli  is a great word by the way, I actually had to look that one up :)",Um...well...I really don't have much.,"What can I say, you did a great job.",I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about.,I think that could make your description stronger.,This was a great entry.,Your description was excellent and by far your greatest strength in this assignment.,It was very detailed and I could clearly imagine the book in my head.,"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered a Š—“future bookŠ— was lacking.",To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going.,I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance: Š—“Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format.,"If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif.""","Also, in your description, when you said Š—“11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far AwayŠ—_Š— Galax should be Galaxy.",This was certainly the most creative idea I've read.,The idea that we are all stories is one that I firmly believe.,It's a great concept.,"I like the way you portrayed all the footprints we are creating through photographs, videos, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc.",Our great grandchildren will have a far more accurate account of our story than we have of our own great grandparents.,What I also like about this concept is that our stories never really end.,Our story is part of our parents' story and our friends' stories and many other stories that are constantly overlapping and weaving together throughout the years.,Your summary is very unclear.,Even in your description I wasn't entirely sure where you were headed.,"I didn't fully understand what your entry was about until I read the ""Future Factor"" section.","Creating a clear summary and immediately describing what this ""Future Book"" actually is will strengthen your whole assignment tremendously.","This entry provides a detailed account of the author's ""future"" book.","I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit.","It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?","This entry was very interesting, particularly for those who are interested in science fiction novels.",The description of the book's synopsis is what makes it really captivating.,The student started their description with a question bringing the reader in as if we were reading the back cover of the book.,It was a very good entry with very little I can find wrong.,The future factor is well described and I feel I have a grasp on what Unbound is all about.,"Additionally, the student explained why this way of writing publishing could be popular in the future.",The student also gave us a taste of what his/her full field entry will look like with a clear and well lit picture.,"I suppose if I wanted to see anything more, it would be more about the history/inspiration of the book.",This entry is actually very realistic and makes a convincing argument for the popularity of orality over reading with examples of existing podcasts and other media today.,"Similarly, although the future factor contains a lot of hypotheses there seems to be enough realism to make it believable such the expense of printing and digital.",I feel the student's entry for future factor could do without the first three sentences.,The student could easily use more examples of how the podcast is increasingly popular and what advances it is already making as well as why it will be more popular later.,The students gives a wonderfully detailed description of his/her future book.,The format was thoroughly explained enough for me to understand what I would be getting into without the student actually giving away the story.,"The student also made a great point in their future factor about how creative format books such as ""House of Leaves"" would not be able to be e-books or digitized.",When reading the future factor I would like to know more about why this type of format is a natural progression.,Would certain people not find it tedious?,"It is true that it may be a richer experience for those who are willing to try, but in all honesty how many people are willing to work and read?",We live in an age where easy access and fun at your fingertips is most popular.,So what makes this book accessible and how will other books follow?,The student has provided sufficient background for his/her future book as well as a convincing and believable argument as to why the format for such a book will become even more popular.,Perhaps the student could explain why it would be a good idea for Emily C. to have her work only accessible online.,"The student has done a great job explaining why it was savvy for Emil C. to use her online resources, but why not also publish in print?",What about people who are still reading physical books and struggle with the digital age?,How will authors like Emily C. ease the people drifting behind into the future of e-books and online videos?,"The part about ""Alice"" met the challenge of the Assignment.",I liked the idea of being in Hogwarts and walking around and looking at notes!,Maybe the author could set these scenarios up in such a way that the curious are rewarded.,I think the references to Nelson and Coupland were unnecessary.,I think Alice covered all your bases on this assignment.,A very spirited campaign for the blog!,I could see how reading a blog could approximate the book-reading experience for you.,But will the blog replace the book?,"I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part.",Description was strong.,Many good points and examples.,I listen to podcasts often while working myself.,Future factor was weak.,Reference to Konstantinou seemed only tangentially related.,You seems do be saying podcasts are the future because publishing might be shut down...?,"Are you saying in the future, there will be no blogs?","If there is no internet, how are the podcasts disseminated?","I'm sorry, I was confused by this.","Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description.",Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving.,Is the answer documentary films or a book with digital capabilities?,You answered the assignment with two different forms.,I would say stick with the latter and re-write #1 & #2.,This was a great example of a story in a new-ish format.,It made me interested in seeing and reading the comic!,Not sure how this is the future if it is now...?,"Also, can it be read on a phone or is size sometimes still a consideration for this format?",I think the subject of the field guide was well chosen.,This is an interesting competitor in a very new and exciting space.,You did a great job of conveying the sense of newness and excitement for the 3 different programs.,I agree that interacting with books in the future could be heading in this direction.,The persepective in section 2 confused me a little bit.,It was almost more like a sales pitch or business case from the IDEO company than a field guide entry.,I think the field guide entry should contain observations from an outside observer.,I would remove the sense that the author has some sort of insight into the IDEO company motives for creating the programs and provide a more in-depth description of how the interface between the programs works.,Section 3 could also use more objectivity.,It reads like one who is partial to this particular program.,This entry highlights a very recent innovation.,The case for this being futuristic is easy to make.,I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels.,I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.,My only criticism of this is that I would like the focus to be aimed more closely at the actual books hosted on Pottermore.,The focus of the assignment should be specifically what constitutes the future of the book.,The format of the books on Pottermore may be the way of the future.,"Maybe someday all books will be hosted on a centralized website, like libraries of the future, with interactive material being an expected requirement.",This entry provides a strong sense of what is means to be a future-ready book.,"I agree with the sentiment that readers in the future will want increased speed, technology, and convenience.","The ebook or hybrid book definitely fits the speed, technology, and convenient requirement nicely.",This entry falls short in providing an actual example.,Describing all ebooks is too generic for a field guide.,I would pick one and explain why the ebook is the future of books through the description of a particular example.,I love the connection to video games.,"Video games are growing in such a huge way that it would be easy to conceive of a distant future where movies, TV, and even literature take inspiration from them.",This is a very fun and futuristic vision.,This entry falls short in providing an actual example of this particular hybrid ebook.,I think a field guide should focus on one example and describe the execution in detail.,Excellent future factor!,I have a few friends that hate reading and have switched exclusively to audio books(where possible).,I have yet to listen to one but it is clear that this type of format is already catching on.,Your particular entry sounds like an improvement on the traditional audio book.,Good job.,I loved this entry.,"It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume.",I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity.,"This entry focused on the Ideo, a really innovative technology.","This entry delves into the specifics of Ideo, and the different concepts that they have developed.","It is well-written, and a thoughtful post.",It meets the challenges of the assignment by examining such an innovative concept.,"This entry could focus a little bit more on the history of the book, and how e-readers fall into the development of the book.","Furthermore, the author could touch on the ways in which people interact with e-readers today.",I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment.,It was innovative and interesting.,The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book.,"As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids.",The description section could be a little bit longer.,"After reading it, I was still wanted to know more.","I would also discuss the history of children's book, and how they have progressed briefly that way there is a comparison with the future.",This entry does an excellent job at incorporating images and text.,"The author clearly thought about this assignment, and the work is very well-written.","The author selected an unique text, and successfully described the book's elements.","This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book.","The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary.",This entry's strength lie in the last section.,"The production of the book is what makes it futuristic, and it is a coincident that the book also happens to be about the future.","The author was also able to include an image, which makes the post stronger.",The description section was written very creatively and sounded like something you would read off the back of the book.,The summary of the book could be a little more specific.,What formats are you talking about?,"The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment.","The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book.","The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book.",This entry's strength is in thinking outside of the box.,"I would have never examined a Post Secret book in a futuristic manner, but I understand the logic behind it after reading this entry.",This author has a detailed explanation of postsecret.com that aides in understanding the concept.,"Overall, it is well-written.",This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book.,"Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years.",What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?,This entry clearly defines the Pottermore website and its attributes as an extension of the Rowling series of books.,It definitely could be viewed as a futuristic technological leap for books especially this type of story that has an epic quality too it and multiple books contained within a single story line.,There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft.,A close reading should catch them.,"Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series.",The author clearly describes the book in great detail as far as its physical look and appearance and gives a good comparison helping the audience understand somewhat what scanimation is.,There are some minor editing errors that should be seen on a slow re-reading of the entry.,"Additionally, I was a little bit confused on the concept of scanimation.",The author of the entry gives a comparison but I find myself still struggling to see the futuristic qualities of the book.,The book sounds like it fits the bill to a futuristic book but also just sounds like a picture a book.,Perhaps a little more explanation of scanimation would explain the book better.,I love how the author of the entry describes all the parts of the book that make it futuristic.,It sounds like the book using the internet in a major way to tell the story and this integration of literature and internet technology definitely speaks to a the future direction of books.,"It sounds like a great read, I'll have to check out.",The author of this entry perhaps goes to far in re-telling the entire plot of the book.,The entry is incredibly long and quite possibly far over the 500 word limit.,A tighter description of the futuristic qualities of the book and a lot less plot telling would make the entry more successful as a field study guide.,Right now it reads more like a book report.,"This entry does a great job of capturing the futuristic essence of ""The House of Leaves.""",There is great descriptions and focus on the formatting of the text in the story.,This appears to be the greatest example of the book's author's forward and futuristic thinking.,"This too, sounds like a great read.",There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.,This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type.,"However, this wasn't the assignment.",There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre.,This entry doesn't describe an actual book.,It merely covers the idea of what a successful future book would look like.,The assignment was to find a book that speaks towards the future and describe it's merits as a future book.,This entry doesn't do this at all.,The strength in this entry is definitely the hard fact that this concept and company are brand new to most of us reading the entry.,The description and use of persuasive language in the description was exceptional.,It made me want to watch the video for a second time.,This meets the challenge of the assignment because it is simply an actual attempt at a company predicting the trajectory of where the future of the book will be.,The problem that had me questioning whether it would work as an entry was the fact that two of the three products were things that surrounded and enhanced the use of a book or ebook.,I might focus on the last company(?),that actually altered the way we would read books.,"The strength in this entry is the third section which explains the ""future factor"".","While the actual product might not interest me completely, the explanation as to how it represents how we as readers can interact with a story in different ways made me want to check this story out to at least experience the different mediums.","This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because it provides us with an actual product that is being used by authors and readers today, but is only a glimpse into what is possible in this new technology.",The formatting is a little bit confusing.,I could not tell if there were parts that were quotes from the actual links provided.,"The strength of this entry is the very fact that instead of going with a digital future book, the writer found an example of what a future physical book might look like.","This meets the challenge of the assignment because while at first glance of this book we might not look at it as the future, the writer explains to us how the formatting is what make s this a prime example of how the future book might evolve.",There are a few grammatical errors in the entry that caused me to have to reread the sentence.,The strength of this entry is the writers passion for reddit.,"The writer seems very invested in this particular website, and states very vehemently that this site is already replacing books.",The entry meets the challenge because it is one of the specified examples in the assignment description.,This entry falls short in two ways.,First is a summary and description.,I was confused for almost all the post as to what reddit is.,"Even once I followed the link, I was unsure as to what exactly its function is.",There needs to be a more concise explanation as to what it is.,The second way is in its contempt of the book.,There are people who will more than likely be offended by how callously the author has decided to write of the importance of books.,"Maybe by explaining why they think reddit will replace physical books and bookstores, the reader will have better insight as to why the thought is replacement versus  growing alongside them.",This entry's strength is it's description of the technology.,"While this is the second entry to describe a technology that interacts with books in the form of an app, it explains the technology in a way that I am able to picture in my mind.",This meets the challenge of the assignment because it introduces the readers to a new way to interact with printed books.,This entry falls a bit short in the summary section.,I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is.,This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.,The strengths are definitely the added images.,"This is something that I forgot about in my assignment, and none of the other reviews that I'm doing are for entries that include pictures at all.",I think that this entry did an excellent job enticing me to read the book.,"I agree that Pessl's ""Night Film"" can be described as a future book because of the extrasensory details that the book includes in order to involve the reader in the story.",I think it meets the challenge of the assignment because it has expertly addressed every aspect of the project and made me want to go out and read this book!,"I would have been interested to read an entry about something other than the style of books that we've already been reading in class, which is what I felt this entry felt like.","I don't really have anything else to suggest, I think this article was done really well and its the best one that I reviewed!","This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because I believe that it is a representation of a future book, albeit for personal reasons only.","This entry is not for something that I think everyone can relate to, nor is it something that I think everyone would be interested.","I do believe that this is an example of a future book, but I think this entry falls short in every other aspect.","I appreciate the fact that this is a more personal example, but I don't think it fits the assignment.",I think that this can be improved by choosing a topic that everyone can relate to.,"This is a narrow topic of an example of a future book for one individual, but not for everyone.",In this scenario I'm still seeing people having to go out and buy books instead of having easier access to them like ebooks.,I think that the author of this entry was feeling very strong about the book that s/he chose.,This allowed for a more passionate feeling about the book which makes the reader of this entry want to read the book and to see the accompanying film and apps!,"I think its really cool that this book has other platforms that go along with it aside from just different pictures like we saw in ""A Dodo at Oxford"".",This ties the book to more recent modes of media which I found very interesting.,"If anything, I felt like this could have used more detail in order to make it a little bit longer.",The length and the voice of the entry didn't seem to go hand in hand.,"I felt the passion that was coming through in the writing, but then it ended before I wanted to.",I think the subject of this entry is very interesting and is something that I would enjoy taking a look at.,Its also a reference to some iconic pop culture which I think will still be relevant in the future.,I think this meets the challenge of the assignment because it ties together the past and the future in a way that I think could be relevant for anyone.,I really wanted to see pictures!,"I loved the description of the book itself, but I wanted to actually see something instead of just reading about the aesthetics of the book.","Also, this definitely needs a more concrete title.",The title seems as if this was submitted on accident or out of confusion.,"Also, please remove ""the subject of this entry"" because that is self-explanatory.","This entry is about documentaries with a primary focus on the ""Babies"" documentary film.",I liked this entry because I felt like it gave a different spin on the project while still meeting the assignment.,This is definitely an example of the future of the book.,I could see people in the future choosing to watch documentaries to learn about things instead of reading books.,"As it is, things like furniture and special dog collars already come with DVDs to show you how to use them correctly.",I think a way to really improve this would be to include videos in this entry.,"This field guide is an online field guide, so it only makes sense to provide links to videos that would help show how documentaries will be the future of the book.","""Take for example"" in the summary doesn't fit with the rest of the assignment, it is self-explanatory.","Also, choose what you want your focus to be on- do you want it on ""Babies"" or on documentaries as a whole?","If you choose to focus more on ""Babies"", then include it in your conclusion of how this is a future book.","If you choose to focus on documentaries on a whole, then I would omit the reference to ""Babies"" and include clips from different documentaries to prove your point.",I really enjoyed the description of how Gaiman reads the script of the book.,I thought the summary was straight and to the point as it should have been - easy to understand and immediately know what I was going to read about.,"As someone familiar with Gaiman's style, but who has not listened to this book, the description of his ""acting"" skills piqued my interested in the project and made me go and physically look up the project online after I finished reading the entry, so I feel that that aspect of the description was well done.","It was also helpful to find out a bit of the background of the book, which unlike many other stories is very unique.","(which was also an aspect of the assignment, just as the voice of the piece and attempting to motivate people to go and read the piece was).",I also felt that the last line of the future section was particularly effective and was a lovely way to end the section by tying in themes of the Gaiman's pieces.,"I think the piece is off to a very good start, in general I think there are just a few places that could be expanded upon with some greater detail.","As the author mentions the presentation of the book is unique as an audio book, so in addition the description of Gaiman's voice as the author has done which is very well done, the argument would benefit from describing how that unique experience of being read to instead of reading; not being separated from the author by your own voice, pacing, and tone of reading, or physical page, but instead almost having a ""tangible"" connection to the author and the authors voice changes the reading experience as only an audio book can.",Doing so would help to further drive home the point that audio books are a entirely unique experience.,"I would have also like to have a scene a little bit of a deeper analysis on how audio books could expand reading in the future - again, drive home the point that this format can uniquely change the reading experience over other mediums, not just save time as the author rightfully mentioned.","I specifically thought the description that focused on the Alice program was direct, easy to follow and clearly showed how the program furthered the reading experience through an immersive experience for the reader - it was the most effective and impactful description and really showed how books can incorporate future technology in order to evolve.","Because the programs are very unique and many readers could be unfamiliar with their concepts I feel that the first two programs, Nelson and Coupland could have benefitted from an expanded description.","I understand that the limited word space requires succinct phrasing, and the current descriptions do a fine job of describing the programs actual functions, but specific examples of something a reader could do while using the app (instead of just describing general functions) and how it would benefit the reader might have clarified the apps purpose and place in the future of the book, making the description a bit easier to understand, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the programs.","I greatly appreciated the use of senses to describe the unique elements of the website in the description section - I also wrote about Pottermore and that was not something I had thought about including in my own description but it really helped to sell the complete atmosphere the site provides not just in content but all the way to its attention to ambiance, which is something unique to web and audio formats that can not be included in the book.","The sensory details helped set the stage for the following descriptions of the types of activities users can participate in on the site, helping to show how immersive and expansive the site is and truly showing how individual it is.","The summary is also very clear and direct, the reader knows exactly what the entry will be about and what to expect in the following sections.","While I like the ideas and direction of the ""future book"" entry, I think it would benefit from a slightly stronger focus on how this can shape the direction of books and readership.","The author mentions that this idea could be applied to other books and other genres, it would be worth it to consider how one could do so, how could authors make the interaction for books uniquely individual like Rowling did, and what will that do for reading - will being able to participate in such and interactive and immersive world drastically change how people read?",There are several interesting and unique applications this type of site has to books in the future and I think the analysis of the future section could benefit from some slightly deeper analysis to truly convince readers how this could change reading forever.,I thought the description of just what makes Pottermore a future book was well crafted and straight to the point.,"Not only did it show how it represents something new in the formatting and use of books by explaining the interactive websites use as a digital extension of the printed world to be used in conjunction with the books, but it mentioned why this was successful - people depend upon technology.","In the other posts I have read, not many authors focused on why their type of book was sustainable and successful for the future of books; this post did in an well though out sentence.",Such an explanation helps to solidify the potential of this type of medium and why it could feasibly be incorporated into other books and other genres as people become more and more familiar with and dependent upon technology.,"I would really have liked to see the author expand the ""asthetics"" portion of the description section.","The general descriptions of what users can accomplish on Pottermore is direct and well written, but I think those not familiar with the site would be more intrigued if the author were to mention what the site looks like, how its set up (use of the sorting hat and the house systems with quizzes and games, common rooms to interact with other users in, the easter eggs in the interactive sections of the novels etc).","This set-up is part of the large appeal of Pottermore and is crucial to it's success as an interactive site, so I feel that some attention does need to be given to it's physical appearance and practical uses in the description section.",I thought the focus on the emotional reaction of the reader based on the text was intriguing and a very interesting way to show readers that the future of the books does not necessarily have to involve technology in a traditional way.,"The descriptions of the multiple formats and uses of texts (and their purposes) truly showed not only the versatility of font and format, but its importance, and just how deeply the presentation of words in a story can effect the readers emotional well being or reflect the state of the character or the world of the book in a visceral way.",The idea that the technological advances of books does not have to mean their conversion to ebooks or their forced incorporation of technology was interesting and well presented.,"While the description of the types of fonts and formats is well presented and well reasoned, if feel including more detail of just how the use of those tools effects the emotional response/connection to the work of the reader would have helped sell the appeal of this type of book more.","By just focusing on the detailed and complex uses of the font and format (while informative, important and well done in the original post) the book can come off as daunting or confusing, which may work for some readers, but in general feels like a hard sell to get people interested.","By incorporating how those techniques create a unique and intriguing experience for the reader however, and why that experience of House of Leaves is unique, people might be far more willing to go into the book with an open mind and spirit and not be turned off to the idea of this type of media in general.",The strength of your rough draft is that you explained the usages of a blog very thoroughly and what a blog encompasses.,"Unless I read the title of your subject, I would not have understood what you were necessarily writing about, I kept waiting to read which particular Š—“blogŠ— you were discussing, however, you were speaking generally about blogs as a whole.",Possibly bring up an example of a blog group that you have found very useful or interesting so that the reader could be directed to those and they could experience what you are describing.,"You spoke of tragedies, possibly reference where you read about a child drowning or cancer that struck you so interesting that you mentioned it here.","The strength of your draft are that you clearly describe the journey of Emily C. chronologically detailing her story as a vegan, among other aspects of that such as including recipes.",I also found it strong that you mentioned how Š—“e-books are the wave of the futureŠ— and the items that are now extinct that once captured memories.,The weakness of your paper is that you started off strong regarding Emily C. however finished somewhat generic with discussing an entire realm of futuristic literature.,"I am conflicted here because I do feel that the information you stated was important (one of the strengths I listed above) yet, I think you should find a more solid connection with EmilyŠ—Ès journey.","You mentioned that she was not associated with a publishing company, did she attempt to be published?",Was publication a more difficult choice to spreading her story than e-book?,"I believe the convenience of publication online could be discussed, wherein that is also important to why she most likely decided to go this route, publishing a book is a confusing and long journey, yet the instant Š—“publishingŠ— online does the job; thus the reason for so many disappearing bookstores.",The strength of your article is that you clearly described the benefits of a hybrid book and contrasted it with an actual book to where I could understand why you would prefer a hybrid book.,"The weakness of your article would be several grammatical errors, however I understood and followed what you were saying with no problem.",I think your article could have had more bearing if you described one particular hybrid book.,"The strengths of your Rough Draft are that you explained thoroughly an internet news community to where I did look it up, I had never heard of it before.","The problem with the claim that this is ""already the future of the internet"" is that there are so many communities of information, it is sometimes difficult to decipher which carries the most accurate information.","However, you could be very right, all the information we now receive is from sources that are not well known, and are put on by anyone, so that is accurate.","You did a great job of striking my interest, so, as I said, I did look up your source and I will definitely look at it again for some information.","The only thing that I would offer as a grammatical change is to not begin a paragraph with the word ""it"".",Everything was wonderful as far else as I could see.,The entire assignment flowed very well and was interesting.,Your strength in your rough draft was that you kept my interest and I desired to look up the site that you cited.,"Everything flowed very well and I think this is an exciting way to jump off from a book into the technology aspect, as not everyone has a computer, but if they desire to go farther than a book, they have the option to do so.","Our discussion boards are very similar, as gaining insight from each other aids in our learning and understanding.","You taught me something with this, as I did not know it even existed, my mother still goes to book clubs at the local library, and this would definitely prove more convenient.","I did not find any weaknesses in your paper, as I stated previously, everything flowed very well and you held my interest.","The motion does match the description I suppose, although I don't get the sense that the square is walking or running.",It honestly just looks like it is tweeking out.,The object does change colors though when its speed changes.,"Aesthetically, I think the program is quite pleasing.",The motion matches the description from everything that I can see.,However I believe we were told to come up with some sort of description that was more story-related.,In this case maybe the walker is a person with paranoia who runs when he thinks something is coming after him.,Otherwise this sketch does what it is described and I love the screen wrapping.,Motion depicts the description !,running period can be increased to make it distinct.the difference between walking and running will be more noticeable apart from color change.,The description isn't very accurate because it seems that the walker mostly runs at the same speed.,"I mostly see green squares of where the walker was, but every once and awhile i'll see a red one.",The colors don't seem to clearly show a difference in speed for me.,The walker seems to mostly be walking the whole time instead of running.,The description matches the patch exactly.,"Great job, I like the idea of it being a bird.","Yes, the motion does the description of the behavior of Question 2.","The ""bird"" does fall blue, and then flies and goes green.","However, the motion is not contained in the window, so instead of falling to the ground, it's a loop of the ""bird"" falling.","Yes, the motion matches the description.","I see the blue as the bird falls and then the green rotating rectangle as it tries to fly, then the motion is repeated on a loop.","Yes, the motion matches.","But I am not sure what ""moves East"" means; it appears to move in a random direction when it tries to fly.",But the way that the majority of the distance traveled while falling is straight down with only small variation is realistic for a free fall.,The motion matches the description very well as it definitely seems like a bird is continually falling and trying to fly.,the different states do a fine job to mimic this.,The motion matched the description very well.,"After reading the description, I felt that the different rectangles became different people.","Their movement were unique and vivid that gave the ""street""(the window) life.",Also he used different color changed when a new column of rectangle showed up.,Very impressive.,"Yes, because the squares are moving in the upward direction but stopping every now and then to ""sidestep"" and then continue in the upward direction.","The movement more or less matches the description, although it seems this person is stuck walking in a VERY crowded area.",Maybe Time Square.,Good job.,The walker matches the description pretty well.,I think it's interesting that the rectangle can only move in four directions rather than diagonally as well.,"It wasn't noticeable at first, but it's different from the class example.",I also like the color changes.,"The description does match the behavior, but I find it hard to see it as a rocket.",When the rocket teleports back the bottom and changes color it seems like it is a separate object.,If the the rocket were to bounce of the walls I think the piece would make more sense.,It matches.,The rectangle moves very slowly for 3 seconds and then starts moving fast.,"When it exceeds the top, it appears again at the bottom and changes a color.",I think the description of your sketch is pretty accurate.,"It reminds me of fireworks rather than rockets, with all that changing colors.","However, the only thing that threw me off was the mousePressed action.","When I click on the screen, the trail disappears, and it doesn't seem like a rocket/fireworks anymore.","Other than that, good job on the sketch!","The motion satisfies the purpose of the assignment, though there are no constraints to limit its movement inside the screen.",It basically does.,"Though, there's not food.",":/Also, I noticed that there was nothing to keep them from going outside of the window.","Yes, the description matches the animation perfectly.",Yes the sketch does match the description above for this project.,"I think this is a great project that had a lot of effort put into it, and the objects really do look like butterflies with various rectangle shapes fluttering around and ""showing up"" one right after the other.","They do stay within a small access, while still fluttering randomly.",The description matches the general behavior of the sketch although I think there could have been more details.,In addition to their description the butterflies were changing color and leaving a trail.,Haha!,This is awesome and very creative.,Their movements are very much like butterflies.,motion matches the description.,Yes.,The motion matches the description.,"I liked the description, it was funny.","The rectangle does exactly as it says, staggering to the exit.",The motion that I see matched the behavior in Question 2 because the movement of the character goes to the bottom left and then stays idle.,It matches.,"Once the program starts to run, the walker starts to walk towards the bottom-left corner, kinda staggered.","But it's not clear if the robot, after reaching the bottom-left corner, stops at that particular position or just moves out side of the window.","Yes it does, however I think it's Elvis ghost moving southwest because it looks very faint/ghostly the way it moves, but I loved the way that they described the movement.","It moves southwest because of (-2, 1) in their code making it take the quickest exit instead of using other ""routes"" or coordinates.",It also has that jumpy/zig-zag movement because it randomly jumps between (+/- 4 pixels left; +/- 2 pixels down).,The animation matches the description and I think the changing colors as the direction changes is also a very nice touch.,It matches the behavior in that the walker goes straight then changes direction as it hits a wall.,The description of the sketch accurately describes the motion of the object.,"I feel it's ironic though that the Rumba leaves behind a trail of ""paint"" instead of cleaning.","Yes it does, it walks forward and then bounces off of the walls.","I like that you used random with the colors, it makes an interesting design as it builds upon itself.","Yes, the motion does match the description of the behavior.","I like how it changes color to indicate a different line is being walked by ""the blind person"" every time they bump into a wall.",Or even the Rumba description is spot on with your code.,I do recognize the rumba motion.,"It's a little bit too slow for demonstration purposes, but it's pretty accurate.",Good job.,The both the creative description and coding description match exactly with what is occurring in this code.,It is a fun description and the amount of detail you used in both explanations is very well done.,The motion does match the description very well as it does seem to mimic two painters competing to color one canvas.,They do walk extremely fast which makes the dashing of the bright guy a bit hard to see but you can tell that it is there and more prominent than the sad painter.,"Yes, the cool walker does move more vertically and the warm walker moves more horizontally.",They both stay in the box and move about randomly and quickly.,Yep.,"Sometimes the walkers move so fast they are a bit hard to follow, but their behavior matches the description.",The motion matches the description in Question 2 because the character overlap constantly with their consistent colors.,"Yes, the description matches the motion well.","The red, raging parolee frantically paces in his home, quickly filling all the available space.",Then it bolts from the home.,"It is a very nice looking animation, and becomes pretty funny when the story is told.","Yes, the motion matches the description.",The rectangle moves but stays within a confined area at the center of the screen.,After a period of time it begins to move randomly outside of that area.,"The color changes from a light to dark red while trapped, then from a light to dark cyan when free.","It could have been programmed to continue walking randomly on an infinite loop once free, instead of stopping or moving outside the screen.",The animation clearly shows that someone is pacing back and forth which perfectly resembles someone who is on house arrest.,Yes because the rectangles are all centered in the window and continues to stay in that area for a considerable amount of time.,The motion represented by the sketch matched the description of behavior in the assignment.,"The walker would turn more and more red each frame that progressed, until the 30 seconds were up.","As soon as the time was up, the walker started to turn cyan like it was supposed to.","It also started going around, but at a certain point, it went off screen and I didn't see it again.",The behavior seems to exhibit the described actions just fine.,"The motion does match the description, but the description seems a little vague.",It does speed up and slow down like the author describes.,The animation is also a bit boring to look at.,Don't be afraid to add color.,I cant really see that its speeding up or slowing down.,You said you wanted it to pop up on the other side of the window if it went out of bound and it did do that.,Yes.,The motion matches the description.,"It starts slow, speeds up, slows, speeds up...",It worked exactly how it is described.,For the most part yes because the rectangles seem to speed off after some time but then tend to cluster for a bit as well.,"Yes, it sort of reminded me of fireworks, the way it explodes for 4 seconds and fireworks sort of leave a trail of smoke after it's done and then you have to load up the next firework so it stays in it's spot for 2 seconds and waits for it to be shot up.",The patch matches the description very well.,Awesome job.,It seems match the description.,I can see both the rotation and the moving of the walker.,But I'd like to see which kind of character does this walker looks like.,It really does.,"Mainly talking about the end there, you don't need an explanation to see that it looks like bubbly water spouting out from the ground.",Nicely done.,The motion of the sketch is as described in question 2.,The rectangle draws itself a couple of times around on the screen and skips to the middle of the screen then repeats again.,"However, what the description says about the duration of each behavior is a bit off by a couple of seconds.",The rectangle moves around for about 1 to 2 seconds and then draws in the middle of the screen for less than 1 second.,The movement is a cool and funny one and it  meets all the requirements.,It sure does match it.,The description is pretty clever and fitting to what I saw.,Good job!,Yes.,"The walker acts normal within a specific area until prompted, and then returns to normal afterwards.",I like the mouse movement incorporation.,I think this patch excellently mimics the description given.,Upon reading the description I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would look like the motion.,"But when loading the patch, it fits it very well and is also extremely entertaining to interact with.",I sort of see it.,"It's very quick on how it reacted to seeing a celebrity, but it seems calm most of the time.",It looks like the walker object continues going in random directions and it doesn't head back to its cosy little area.,This is one of my favorites; it's very different.,You did a really good job depicting the fluttering wings and the basic movement of a fly.,Good job.,"Yes, the motion matches the description well.",It is obviously a fly.,"While sometimes the fly flies backwards, the twitchy erratic flight and the size changes really sell it.",The motion perfectly matched what was written in the second question.,"The fly changes states every 2.5 seconds, and it has the four different actions.","The only thing is that it wasn't a rectangle, but as the student wrote, the ellipse just looks better.",Yes it does.,The fly seems to move in random patterns every few seconds and has several different behaviors.,"The description fits the behavior, for the most part; it does resemble lighting in slow motion.","Though, it does not really look like it was changing color on my screen.",The sketch exhibits the described behavior very well.,Yes.,The motion described is performed by the rectangle.,The motion is similar to the way it is described in the description.,"The squares do move similarly to a lightning bolt, although I don't actually see the color changing like the author suggests.",It's also a little weird to say it's repeatedly trying to hit the ground.,That illustration of the animation seems a little forced.,Yes it does match the description above.,The lines of squares are moving from the top to the bottom right corner looking like a lightening bolt.,I also like the transparent blue that they made.,"When I clicked the mouse and held it down the squares turned red, but when I released it went back to blue.","The actions of the walker are described well, my only suggestion is when the walker goes off screen have it come through the other sider and not towards the middle.","The walker matches the description, but seems almost identical to the example given in class that had the walker tend to travel right.","The only difference in the actual movement is that instead of wrapping the screen cleanly, there is a 400 pixel gap that the walker won't travel.","Also, you do not describe how you coded any of it, so it appears that you just took the class example and made a few minor aesthetic changes.",it does.,"What I would change about it, though, is that I would reset the squares on random points of the width as well.","This is because when life sets you back, it can either be a little or a lot.","Also because after a while, one side of the screen is left blank, making it look kind of lopsided.",P.S.,"When I played it at first, it shaped out would looked like a running fox with a flaming tail.",Thought that was cool.,"Umm, how does that describe the behavior of the walker object?",This isn't supposed to be an artists statement but a description of the behavior of your walker object by using some behavior that is found in the natural world or described through a character of some kind.,"The Sporadic adjective does kinda work since the movement seems random, but I would really try to make your object link to something in life besides a square.","The motion fits the description in terms of it moving wild and sporadically, however, your description seems a little vague or open for interpretation.",It might be a bit of a stretch to say the motion mimics us fighting for what we want.,It kind of looks like it.,It is just really hard for me to get past that they are just squares(or rectangles).,But it does what it was supposed to do.,The walker matches the behavior in that it stays still while moving slightly for a while before 'jumping' to a close by area.,With the strokeWeight it gives the walker a cool fading effect that adds to the jumping idea.,Good job!,The walker matches the description very well.,It moves in a small area for a short while and then jumps to a new spot on the screen.,It was obvious that the code was original and easy to understand.,Yes.,The character seems to move in any direction and it also returns to the center when it goes out of the 500x500 boundry.,I do not believe the motion matches the description.,"Perhaps the speed needs to be decreased, it is not visible when the rectangle is standing still to save energy - there seems to always be movement.","However, I do notice when the rectangle is moved 30 units away from a point.",The description and behavior definitely match though there isn't really a story behind it.,Maybe the spiral represents a bug flying in a spiral towards the screen but then dies cause it hit the screen.,However I really love the coding you did for this.,It looks beautiful.,"Yes, it does create the look of hand drawn spirals.",I thought your use of expanding the radius was neat.,Your description of what is occurring is not done in the way that was asked.,"You did describe it correctly, but just not as a character in a movie.","However, the creating of spirals is really cool and entertaining to watch.","Description and actual sketch look to be matching, but it's not described as if it was a character in a movie.",This is also a really cool design.,Great job!,The crazy colorful motions do match the description you gave for your walkers behavior.,"Yes, it does, I like how you were able to use the millis(), I had a hard time understanding how to make that work.","The motion described is actually described pretty well, and with your description it actually made the program come alive more than it normally would.","You used the colors of the rect to help the viewer go deeper into your narrative, and it helps the viewers imagination create a world in their own heads using your sketch, This is a good mix of art and programming.",I really like the creativity in the description.,"I think the description was made to fit the animation, but I feel it works here.",The animation does display the erratic behavior of the scenario you presented.,"Visually, it is very fun, although the rapid switching between grays can be a little displeasing to watch.","Yes, it does seem like the walker is running around before circling in the same spot then running around randomly again.","The assignment matches the description, it works well in that the rapid movements are done with larger squares while the smaller circling movements are matched with smaller squares.",The sketch was quite unexpected.,I had expected a large rectangle travelling down the screen and found one that was small and nearly transparent.,"However, I like how well it matches the actions of a parachute explorer.","The response in question 2 matches the behavior of the rectangle as like that of the parachute explorer, giving me a better sense of what is happening on the screen.",movement matches description.,but no randomness in motion.,This is a really cool idea.,Your description matches with the sketch.,"I was expecting to see more parachutes, but this is really neat.",This is a super cute idea and the description matches the patch very well.,"There's two rectangles on the screen, one is the parachuter, is the other one his parachute?","Anyways great patch, the small story really adds a lot to it.",it does look like what is described.,"I actually saw the sketch before reading your description, and I was thrown off by the colors.",It seems like the objects were splattering on the screen rather than falling.,Cool effects though.,So much was going on in your sketch.,"I can see how it can be a meteor shower, but I didn't see how it was falling to the bottom left.",It looked more like the meteor shower was hitting the sketch window verses looking at it in another perspective from the sketch window.,The object behaves in the described manner.,You also accidentally included the multiple ellipse sketch!,"Yes, the motion matches the description.",The objects definitely fall to the left at a 45ish degree angle.,"They size-changes give the impression of a rotating or burning object, which matches the meteor example.",The motion does match the behavior described.,"It seems a bit slow with the predator following the prey, but it does create a great stalking effect.",The motion of chasing the prey is done excellently and quite enjoyable to watch.,The motion matches the description of the behavior in the second question.,"The prey starts off in the middle, while the predator starts off at a distance.","When it got closer, both of them would bolt off at a little faster pace.",Chasing is really cool !,Movement matches description !,really feels like tiger and a dear mapped by gps !,The code matches the description of the walker and the idea is very well done having two walkers that interacted with each other.,The differentiation in color too was also a very good idea as well as the print lines so the actions were clear.,Yes absolutely.,"The ""predator"" walker slowly moves towards the ""prey"" walker; then going straight for the ""prey.""","Yes, in that there seems to be squares being shot from the left to the right side of the window and then larger squares ""gathering"" at the end of the projectile trails.","Though the motion in the description of behavior in Question 2, it seems to not match our original assignment for creating a character rather than a situation.",I dont really see it.,It looks cool but i dont really see how it is fireballs or soldiers repelling.,"Yes, you described how the motions are done.",This is something i actually tried to do my self.,The explanation of the animation was spot on.,it looked just like a fireball.,"Yes, the motion matches the description.","The square character moves around the screen but once the mouse is place in the window, it begins to follow it and once it catches it, it moves randomly around the mouse in about a 10 pixel radius.",This animation is cute.,Yes!,"The further your mouse is the faster it goes towards it, slowly ramping to a stop.",I really enjoyed this one.,This.... is super creepy.,In a good way.,But seriously that face is creepy.,Also I believe we were supposed to describe the walker in terms of real world examples.,For example maybe this is a stalker who waits until his target appears and then he follows them.,Otherwise this a really good sketch.,This was a fairly well done code though you didn't answer the Question 2 in the proper way.,You have describe the motion properly though and the affect is fun.,The reptile does exactly what the description said.,"It stands still and then will burst in a random direction, in a straight line.",The description definitely matches the motion.,It stays still and then bursts forward in a random direction in straight lines.,The color and blinking help with the dragon description.,It matches.,"The walker stays still most of the time and once in a while, moves rapidly to a random direction, in a straight line.",I find that the representation of a reptile walk is quite well shown in this processing sketch.,"The description in question 2 gives meaning to the sketchŠ—Ès behaviors, stating that like a reptileŠ—Ès movement, the rectangles move around in one area for a while before speeding to another part of the screen and repeats.",The motion does match the description very well.,"To be completely honest, this is the only walker I saw that I felt had the concept before the final product itself.",I find the design hypnotizing and fun to watch.,It seems that a good deal of thought went into the concept.,I also like how the window is used like a cage where the bearded dragon stops when he reaches an edge as opposed to him or her going through to the other side.,Matches the description.,"The colors are cool, but I wish there would have been more focus on the movement since that was what this assignment was about.","The box could only move along in one direction at a time rather than diagonally, and only has one speed.","This could have had a lot more variation in the movement, which I think would have made more sense.",I like the descriptive story that this person has to help me visualize the sketch with meanings.,The sketch does appear to do as told in the story: rectangles building and multiplying on top of one another with flickering colors as though like a deck of Solitaire cards.,"Yes, the motion matches the description.",The rectangle moves randomly and each instance is recorded as a different color which gives the illusion of an infinite stack of colored rectangles.,Makes an interesting visual.,"Yes, the description was interesting, and certainly expanded on and help explain what the walker is doing.","Yes, the behavior of you motion matches the description you had for it.",Very creative.,"The description says that the rectangle ""fears"" or avoids the edges of the screen.","However, it seems to often go over the bottom and left side of the screen, but avoids the top and right sides of the screen by about 100 pixels.","Yes, the rectangles increase in size and then reduce in size but at a different location.",I am not seeing what you are saying.,The motion seems random to me.,I don't see the shrinking as it reaches the edge and it will actually go over the edge of it's world.,The description of the motion is off as well because it's jumping rather than moving like a maniac.,"Still, it's an entertaining code all the same.",Behavior was pretty close.,It seems to expand and contract regardless of whether it is near the edge of the screen or not.,"Yes, your description of the behavior is well done.",It is very cool to control the walker by the mouse!,The walker movement matches the description very well.,But the walker walks out the window which I think does not match the requirement.,"However, the walker is so creative so I think walk out is okay.","Yes, the motion does match the description of the behavior.",It moved whichever direction I moved my mouse.,Yes the description states that the user controls the mouse and the random walker will follow wherever the mouse goes.,"For the most part (with just a few times not working), the random walker is control by the mouse moving in whatever direction and then continuing in that direction until the mouse is moved again.","I sort of get the description, but it took experimenting to really figure out what was happening.","I like the idea, but I think it could have been made a bit more obvious.",Also we needed to describe the sketch in terms of a real life animation.,So maybe this is a robot that is commanded where to go in terms of velocity and direction via scanning a subject.,Overall decent sketch.,movements matches description !,cool shaking effect !,I was confused at first cause nothing was happening.,It'd help if you hinted to use the mouse.,This one was pretty creative.,I'm wondering if this analogy is what you were working around.,The behavior of the sketch is very neat; the vector dot follows the mouse wherever the mouse clicks from positions on the screen.,"It is also interesting to think of the vector dot, which shakes when in one position and quickly follows the mouse the next, as a nervous extra in a movie being directed.",The description matches this sketch.,The motion matches the behavior in Question 2 because the character follows where the mouse clicks.,"Yes, it moves as described.",This was a really creative use of the mouse controls.,"Yes, the rectangle follows a predictable path and does not escape the window boundaries.",It is a square and it does bounce from wall to wall.,So yes,"Yes, it does match the description.","The square bounces off of the four sides of the window, but whatever it does it will never get out of the window due to the four parameters set in their code.",Hi Brandon!,"Clearly, you got it to work.","Movement-wise, I think it should move more erratically, not too symmetrical like what's shown here.",Good job though!,The object matches the description given.,However the behavior is repetitive and does not seem to look like a person that is trapped in a box.,Perhaps if he changed speeds and directions it may look like someone pacing (or running ) around in a box.,It matches.,"The walker stays still for 8 seconds and starts rapidly walking and after 10 seconds, it repeats.","This is a great example of random walk, and it creates a beautiful pattern still the shape was supposed to be a rectangle and not an ellipse.",Also the movement is not constrained to the screen.,Yes.,"While I don't remember the Space Core from Portal, the character did have a still random state and then dashed in a left diagonal.",The walker matches the description.,It has the yellow circle walker (does not match the requirement but I think it's okay) walks toward the top left.,And it waits in few seconds and repeat walking again.,Your description matches watching I'm seeing in the sketch.,"Simple, but its neat.",The character completely matches what was indicated in the second question.,"I didn't read the description until after I had seen the sketch, but it totally looks like little feet walking around the screen.",I really liked this!,Well done.,"Yes, they gave a very clear description of the walker on how it sort of wonders for quite some time and then gets scared and starts to run, the only thing I want to know is how did they manage to make the animation wrap around the window instead of making it get stuck at the edge of the window.",The walker definately looks like a person on Marauder's map.,The only thing that i can think of that would make it more convincing was if the footsteps fade after a while.,Even then it looks really great!,"Yes, this looks just like footprints.","Really cool, I wish I had thought of something like this.",It matches.,It looks like the map in Harry Porter.,It starts to walk for a while and then walks fast towards random directions.,The description matches perfectly.,I kinda wished you didn't have to use squares for this one though.,You have described this very well though it did need to be about an actor.,"Overall, I understand it full and it makes sense to me.","ItŠ—Ès a cool waterfall pattern, the only line of code missing is the one to constrain the movement.","Yes, the motion matches the description perfectly.",The motion really does mimic the appearance of water drops and it does seem to restart itself once it hits the window sill.,The description  is very vivid and interesting.,"The ""waterdrop"" keep falling down from the top to the bottom of the ""window"".",It just like a normal scene in the life.,I like this story setting and the walker and the description match 100%.,The rectangle does perform the described motion.,This was very cool.,The walker matched the behavior of the description perfectly.,"It started off slow until it hit a wall, and then kept speeding up as it kept hitting the walls until it disappeared.",The motion does match the behavior described as the runner speeds up.,"However, I would have liked to see a more progressive build up of speed as it seems like he accelerated very quickly.",But as he becomes a speed runner it would make sense to quickly accelerate.,"Although the movement is funny, I don't see the requirements being met with the behavior, the movement is not continue and is not limit to the screen.","The motion matches the description of behavior in Question 2 because the faded colored rectangle shakes and moves, but the creator does not give much detail as to how much the character should move","Yes, it does resemble the Burberry perfume pattern after shaking and moving for a little while.",This looks good and the pattern matches the description.,Very good color palette.,"Yes but it would of been nice to have the description more like the question asked, ""writing a description for the actor who will play the part"".","I loved the description of Burberry perfumes and it does ""create a pattern by shaking and moving""","Yes, the walker moves in random directions while sort of jumping horizontally and vertically slightly.","Yes, though it seems to be descending very slowly for someone ""going down a staircase"", even hesitantly.",It seems like the motion is gradually moving up?,"The sketch doesn't seem to be slowly going down, it seems to be following a sin wave pattern (which is equally cool).",Other then that it looks good.,The animation almost resembled that of a slinky.,Good job on making it look as if it was going down stairs.,"The motion kind of matches the description, but after watching it for a few minutes, it pretty much stayed in the middle of the page.",I don't see the overall downward motion that is described.,I think the error is because you are only calling the if statement 25% of the time.,So 75 % of the time it is going to stay in the middle of the page.,Also you should change line 36 to a range between two positive numbers and line 39 to be += not -=,It really does look like a character that might be lost in its environment.,If I let the sketch run long enough it makes a really neat design.,Good job!,"Yes, the sketch and the squares really are smooth and tiny, going in random lines and loops, trying to figure out where it wants to go and changing it's direction every once in awhile where it wants, but it stays concise and smooth throughout the whole animation.",The assignment matches the description however I feel the walker was more similar to an artist drawing a line or a bumble bee buzzing around.,yes it does,"This is really cool, it looks like an ice skater or someone drawing randomly.",The patch matches the text.,Yes.,The rectangle does move downward and slightly to the right.,"Yes, the walker is predictable in its repetitive downward right path creating a trail that eventually fills the screen.",The walkers behavior matches what the description says.,The walker reappears when it exists the canvas and follows a similar moving pattern.,Good job.,The walker matches the description given.,"I don't really like the predictability, but it seems like it was what you were going for.",I wish you would have given a clearer description of how you implemented the random function and if-else statements.,This patch was clean and simple which I personally think is nice.,At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think.,Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.,Not too much surprise but solid work nonetheless.,"The patch is clean and well organized, but there are a few pieces that really don't need to be there.","Overall the patch was disappointing, the sounds were just yes and no in German (i think).",Technically the patch was just the standard one that we saw in class.,There was nothing really extra or different about it.,"Looks similar to the example shown in class, not too complicated but also easy to follow.",The sounds are interesting because it seems to be a different language?,"It's interesting because it makes it a bit more fun to use than just a ""yes"" and ""no""","The only thing I think could have been improved a bit was the vocals that were used, maybe adding in a few more words would have made it more interesting",It looks very clean and organized in a presentable state.,Well done with choosing some basic colors and arranging everything for a nice polished finished program.,"The first few guesses were slow, then I tend to quickly go through all the keys from top-left to bottom-right of the keyboard.","This game was a little trickier as it requires you to use Shift+""-"" in order to get the correct key combination.","The patch was very well done and simplified to the barebones of what was need, with some slight flare for aesthetics.",It is apparent that this submission was created by someone with prior Max/MSP experience or has done a formidable amount of practice in such a small amount of time since class has begun.,I did learn how I could have simplified my patch even further and how to add in a feature like the option to randomly choose an ASCII key code.,"Overall, this was A+ work for this assignment in my opinion.","The patch looked very colorful, and each part was explained nicely.",There was even a little humor thrown into one explanation.,"Each part is split into three sections, and each part has its own color.",One thing I thought was really cool was the addition of a volume control that would let you control how loud or quiet the sounds were overall.,"Each sound has its own meter, so you can see how each loud or soft each sound was.",I was more involved as a user since I could pick my own key number from a generator and control pretty much everything.,"However, the random number generator wouldn't give out a number, so I would have to type my own number to get it to run the sounds.","The 'yes' sound was pleasant and not overbearing, and the 'no' sound made me cringe a little just because of what it actually was, but it was amusing though.","Technically, there was a lot going on ""under the hood"", but you couldn't see all the connections from the layout that was presented.",Not a bad thing since it's much clearer that way.,It's not until you unlock it could you poke around a little.,I did learn how to use the volume controller since I thought that was nice touch to the whole thing.,"As mentioned earlier, the random number generator didn't work, so maybe double checking everything just to make sure everything works as it should.","Other than that, it's a good patch.",Compared to what we initially created in class the aesthetic of this patch was definitely colorful and fun to look at.,The overall feel was that it was engaging but the connections were hidden and obscured being able to know how this patch was made.,It took me a few minutes to work out what was actually going on because of how different it was from what I had seen before.,After getting over my initial confusion I enjoyed the humorous dynamic of the step by step instructions and enjoyed playing with it.,The sounds were somewhat uncreative but succinct in their functionality.,Having an added volume control was a nice component to the overall interface.,The overall approach was creative and fun although somehow seemingly simplistic.,The color was a surprise and it was exciting to be involved in choosing a 'yes' key.,I definitely got some ideas of how to improve the aesthetic and interactive components of future projects.The random generator key did not seem to do anything and I would have liked to have access to a version where I could see how they 'wired' everything together.,Looked nice and neat.,Very impressive.,"Visually, the patch was very pleasing.",the good key sound and bad key sound had nice contrast.,"Everything was hidden and even as I was dismantling the patch, I had no idea how anything was connected.","As a novice user, I had nothing to gain from this patch from a coding perspective.",It was just presented as an end user product.,I love the look of it and all the colors it's the only one I've seen like that.,The horn like sound kind of through me off.,Headphone + volume up= not a good idea.,But I like the other sound.,I like how everything is written out it makes it easier to use,"idk how they coded it but i was pleasantly surprised by it and i'd like to make my patches more ""clean"" looking as they did",The patch is organized.,"There's a clear visual logic (top to bottom), and added text comments on certain sections help in understanding each part.","The experience is marginally interesting, in a way similar to my own (after tweaking and playing with it several times).","Nothing particularly interests me, though I do find that the ""failure"" sound is louder and more jarring than the ""success"" sound in a way that makes the latter feel rewarding.","Technically, the creator did not depart from the in-class instructions at all, which means the patch works fine.","It would have been cool to see innovation, with more sounds and/or more than two outcomes.","Moreover, the fact that the speaker is turned off by default is a bit confusing.",Very basic.,Almost equivalent to the patch that David created in class to demonstrate how to execute this project.,"Not very aesthetically pleasing, however it is straight forward and easy to follow.",The sounds were somewhat entertaining.,"The ""Bad Keys"" play a laser sound that was probably found within an online wav file library, and the ""Good Key"" was a similar swirling sound.","Both sounds have a technological, galactic type of sound that seem as if they could be found in a space-themed computer game.",This patch is essentially an exact replica of the patch we created together in class during our first Max demo.,All that is different are the sounds.,There wasn't anything particularly surprising or exciting about it.,"Since most of us are still pretty unfamiliar with Max, I understand there might not have been much else to include to differentiate between this patch and the one created in class.","However, while playing around with my own project, I figured out how to edit colors, change fonts and font sizes, and a few other basic ways to change the overall aesthetic and make it a little more interesting.",Perhaps Khanh could have done the same.,It looks very clean and easy to understand.,"Although it gave away that the ""k"" key is the good key!","Because of the old-school laser sound, it reminds me of playing an arcade game.","The bad sound reminds me of when you die in Galaga, and the good sound reminds me of your ship getting abducted by the enemies in the game.","It's fun to play, but I'm a little bummed that the key was given away in the patch.","Technically speaking, the patch is very simple.",It's laid out very basically so it's extremely easy to understand what things cause which reactions from the system.,Pressing one of the keys causes a button to light up so the user can tell where the reaction is taking place in the patch.,Also there is a sound meter that lets you visually see the sound.,"There isn't anything very exciting about it, however, I think the patch gets the job and its simplicity is appreciated.",The patch is very clean and easy to read.,It would be easy to copy parts of it if necessary.,The patch is very mysterious.,The sounds remind me of an alien but it is hard to tell what sound is the good key and which one is the bad key.,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, there was nothing new added to this patch or nothing I could learn from it.",It was very straight forward.,"If you could do something better it would be to add another concept to the patch and also make the sounds more recognizable as ""good"" and ""bad"".","It looks very approachable with every feature of the patch explained in short, but sweet notes","It feels very entertaining to use and offers a simple, yet satisfying experience.","I was rather surprised that the creator explained every single part of the patch, made things very easy to understand.",I learned now that for the next max patches to put notes by all feature so that new users understand them better.,"Nothing too bad to say, really.","The patch is very detailed, and uses lots of comment boxes to explain what everything does.","I like the sounds that were chosen, it's fun to play with.","However, the patch shows the correct key which makes it easy to win.",I like how they used the print function to make WRONG pop up when the incorrect was used.,That was a nice touch.,The only thing that I wish was different is how they show the right key.,"Not a lot as far as features go, but quite understandable.","It feels pretty goofy to use, but in a good way.",Most notably due to the sound cues used.,Nothing too surprising outside of the humorous sound files.,Although there's nothing bad to say about it either.,looks clean.,"Simple one key ""yes"".","a little goofy, but that is due to the audio effects.",it seemed more simplified than mine.,But I used multiple keys and not mono sound.,"The look is very condensed and minimalistic, the commands are close together and compact.","The sounds are silly and made me laugh, I wasn't expecting them.",I'm tempted to just sit and mash the keyboard to hear the sounds.,"I do like how their patch is stripped and small, I know that in mine I definitely put too many operations that weren't needed.",I wish they didn't put which was the correct key in the locked patch.,The patch is easy to understand and looks similar to the example in class.,"After looking at this patch, I realized the importance of comments.",I wish I added more comments in my own personal patch as this person did so another person could understand what to do on my patch.,The sounds are goofy and funny which make the patch exciting to do over and over again.,The sounds are entertaining but the design seems very practical so there are two different feelings coming from the patch.,The patch seems very typical.,It is similar to the tutorial that was explained in class.,I did learn that I should use more comments in my own patch since the comments on this patch helped me understand what was going on.,"However, I added almost none to my match and I have a feeling people will be confused.",I feel like they could have simplified the patch more or at least made it cleaner looking because it looks crammed and spread out.,"It is simple just like the one reviewed in class, but it does not take away from the effectiveness of the program.",I know what each of the components do and the buttons are additional visuals to the sound when the program is active.,"The patch is comical, comprising of bomb noises as each incorrect key is pressed and when the correct key is pressed, the hallelujah sound is like a mini praise for finding the correct one.","However, I think the sounds are a little long for such rapid key pressing.","I know as I was going through it I pressed it maybe once to hear the sound and then continued to press until I found the right key, not even waiting for the sound to finish.",The correct key sound was extremely long as well and made me want to hit an incorrect key just to stop it.,The patch is identical to the example in class but I cannot really diss or suggest something much better considering I am fairly new to Max 6 and my patch is pretty much the same.,"Nothing out of the ordinary, didn't really learn new information.","I would just suggest making shorter sound files, but that doesn't have much to do with the actual coding aspect.",the look was elegant.,Simple sounds.,feels good.,Like the use of the sound bar.,nope.,very simple.,It's nothing but the essentials in this patch - no aesthetic additions but the bare minimum for the game to work.,Everything looks neatly arranged.,The sounds were entertaining certainly.,For me the missing sound reminds me of playing the game battleship and the victory sound of hallelujah is classic.,I thought that it was amusing.,"It feels functional, but not much more than that.",I would categorize more on the goofy than beautiful end of the spectrum.,They approached it by creating the bare minimum needed to finish the assignment.,"This tells me it is likely they are newer to Max/MSP or simply didn't have much time to create anything ""prettier.""","This patch is very basic, but it's simplicity makes it easy to understand.","In general, this patch isn't completely user friendly.","In order for the patch to work, the user has to load both of the sound files and also turn on the sound.",A couple of comments listing the steps to make the patch work would help users who don't know what they're doing.,"The sounds were pretty funny, especially the good sound.","Even though the patch is very simple, if it was lined up more according to the grid in the patcher window, it might make it look better aesthetically.","It has a logical flow, but the connectors are all curved, so it looks a little unprofessional or messy.","There are a few comments, but they're not specific or unclear if the person is unfamiliar with the program.",It is very goofy and simple.,The game over sound is from a game and made me smile.,I liked the sound choice.,I was disappointed that the ready sound did not work.,The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class.,It has two sounds: gameover.wav and ready.wav.,"The gameover sound works fine, but the ready sounds does not work.",They could have left in the comments what key number 31 is.,"The patch is fairly neat and clean, it is well organized.","The patch ran well but I am not sure if there was something wrong with the download files or not, but I couldn't get the sound files to work.",The patch was nicely done and the experience was fun.,It took me a while to figure out what was the good key.,"As I stated before, it might be my computer but I couldn't get the sound files to work in the patch.","The user seemed to stick with the basic structure and outline of the assignment, which isn't necessarily bad because I did the same.","However, the patch did function properly and was very neat.",The patch itself has an overall nice flow to it when it comes to how many different things she used.,She did it short and simple and its easy to follow.,"I could only make one sound to work and that is only because i clicked on the button itself, unfortunately i could not fine the key to activate it itself but the sound that it makes I think is pretty amusing.","As said before it only plays the sound when you find the key, it seems as if they placed the output to the wrong port around the speaker area, if not it would have worked perfectly fine i feel.",The patch looks pretty clean and seems simple.,It appears similar to the Max patch we made in class.,The patch detects key presses yet it seems impossible to get the keycode that the student set for a 'yes'.,It feels fine though it feels annoying that I can't get the 'yes' to play.,The sounds don't seem to work.,"This student is checking for a keycode that I am not sure how to recreate, even after using google, which is surprising yet not quite exciting.","Otherwise, it's similar to the patch made in class.","The no sound doesnt play either, though it's possible to get a 'no' response from a key press.","They could have made it possible for the user to get a 'yes' to play, which taught me that it can be really powerful if you have something that the user wants to do but cannot or does not know how.",It is simple just like the class example but it does not take away any elements to how it functions.,It is just a little more expanded vertically.,I think it would have been great if it worked all the way.,"When I finally hit the correct key, I heard the sound; however, there was a problem with every other key where there was no sound heard.",I even pressed the open ready.wav and no sound came through so I had to hear how it sounded from the actual folder.,"The idea was great, making every other key seem like it was correct and the correct key the fail since it said game over.",The basic layout from the example in class but I cannot judge since that is how I did mine.,"In general, just making sure that the sound file is working properly since there was some trouble there.","Well, I opened the patch but it unzipped as a AIFF and not a patch.","Even after trying to launch it through MAX, nothing still worked.","Judging from the files in the user's folder, they seemed to have created a really awesome patch.",I wish it would have loaded properly on my computer.,"As I said before, solely judging from the files in the user's zip folder, they seemed to have constructed a really interesting patch.","I was actually not able to view the max patch, the files contained all the music files and a max text file.","As far as the included sound files, i could only tell that the ""so tired"" file was the bad key but for the rest I wasn't too sure.",On the other hand they were pleasing to listen to.,I was not able to view the patch from what was downloaded.,There was no patcher file.,There was music and a text file but no patcher.,No patcher to test,No patcher to test.,"The visual logic of the patch is straightforward, and text comments direct user action very clearly.",Using the patch is a humorous experience.,The creator took the extremely simple premise of the assignment and made a clever single-serving application.,"One significant technical problem is that the file was saved as .maxpat.txt, meaning it works only after the .txt extension is removed.",It would have been much better if the file included was a max patch instead of a max patch interpreted as raw text.,The use of several different outcomes from one piece of input data is a surprising technical innovation from which I feel I could learn something.,The approach is very technically creative.,The overall feel for this patch is a short and simple layout that is easy to follow.,The sound files fit their descriptions well because there is a game over quote for not hitting the right key and a victory quote for when you finally find the correct key.,"The patch worked perfectly fine with no problems at all, it took me a while to find the right key but i actually found it eventually so it was a success.",The design was very similar/identical to what the instructor designed in class.,No alterations were performed to make the construction simpler.,The construction resembled that of a christmas tree.,The setup was simple and easy to use.,The sounds were entertaining to listen to (game over sound and fan uproar brought imagery to the listener).,"Due to the lack of change in the structure of the assignment, it seems that the only component that was creatively thought out were the audio files.","Nothing surprising or exciting came from the design aspect of the project, but as previously stated the audio was entertaining to listen to.","The patch seems to look good, however when I tried to use the keys no sounds played back for me...",The sounds will not play back properly for me..,"The approach seems pretty simple, and straight forward, however it appears that somewhere within the program something was misplaced or forgotten.",The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.,My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy.,It doesn't really have much of an experience since it tells you the correct key.,"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting.",I didn't learn anything from it.,They couldve added extra sounds to make it better.,Nice straight forward patch.,I like that there was a comment telling me what the good key was.,Having the buttons was nice because I could visually see there was a hit.,I noticed there were two speakers so the sound would overlap.,When I tried to use the patch I had to manually press the open object and insert the name of the wave files.,The good key was a ding but the bad key was a very obnoxious Š—“Ha Ha!Š—   It did not make me want to play with it.,The patch did not work as it sat.,I had to load the wav files to the open object.,"The patch could have been simpler if the sfplay~ name, 1 format had been used.",There were extraneous parts that were unnecessary.,It looks pretty cool.,looks like the person really tried to make it look original.,I liked it a lot for that reason.,I really like the images that I think this person made that surround the ezdac and the one on top with the keyboard.,Those make it look really cool.,The experience was very cool.,I liked how he also put videos for when you got it wrong and when you got it right.,I also really liked the sound effects.,"Overall, I think it was really fun to use.",I think that comments explaining how it works would have been nice.,I think it was done very nicely and organized though.,"I did learn how to connect a video, so that was a good learning experience.",It was Overall a great patch though.,Felt like I just had opened a pop up window on the internet inviting me to play a game.,"Simple and straight to the point, this patch was fun and easy to use.",The primary sound was simple but slightly annoying (perhaps like a good 'no' sound should be.,The surprise of the 'yay' when I found the yes key was extremely pleasing and the the fireworks certainly added a cool surprise.,"Simple structure but effective, the added graphics were great but unexpected because they had not come up in class as an option within the creative process of this software.",Seems like I am learning a lot about what the possibilities for more user friendly interface design.,My only critic was that the buttons at the bottom could have been lined up more symmetrically.,It's wonderful.,The sounds are entertaining and grasp the meaning of positivity and negativity.,The approach is perfect.,I learned that UI and presentation mode in Max is very critical to developing a successful patch.,"The header is very creative, presenting the challenge of attempting to locate the good key.","It presents a nice, inviting title and lays out the challenge before you while still being minimal.","The master sound button is a great idea, saving the viewer a little time by not having to scroll down and switch each individual sound button on.","The logistic part of the patch, though, is much the same as we were presented in class, with a little extra fuddle and detracting clunkiness included.",Once the master sound button has been toggled to active the process becomes as simple as pressing different keyboard buttons until the right one has been pressed.,"; in this case it is ""P"".","The sounds are clear in relaying to the user the information of the keyboard button, good or bad, but seem like stock audio samples that lack originality and are devoid of personality infusion on part of the programmer.","The design is nice, but the sounds aren't entertaining to hear repeatedly, so after two/three times, I stopped the program.",The introduction of the header and master audio switch is a novel idea that is aesthetically pleasing and improves immensely the ease with which the viewer can control the program and use it correctly.,"The presence of the links between the different objects, necessary as they may be, slightly detract from the quality of the header and switch button.",The actual working part of the program seems slightly clunky due to the zigzagging wires crossing through one another and the yes/no button signals.,The organization of the patch elements and including more novel sounds will make the patch perfect.,This patch is very similar to that of the patch we went over in class.,"The good key and bad key branches are the same with two sfplay~ messages, two meters, two ezdac~ messages, minus the different sounds that correspond to each of them.",There is also a comment box that says ASCII value for the intended ASCII number code.,"While I was using this patch, I was very confused by the good key and bad key sounds.",The sound for the bad key element did not sound as negative as I would want it to be.,"The good key element, with the sound being a bell ringing, was a good choice for determining what the good key was but, the choice for the bad keys was questionable with it being just a simple drum hit.",The way how this patch was approached was the same way as the patch that we went over in class.,Something that was different that I saw was the addition of the comment speech bubble.,I did not know that that was a way that comments can be presented and is definitely something that I learned.,The patch is very simple and it's easy to understand the signal flow.,"The patch is very simple to use, but overall not very user friendly.","For example, in order for the patch to work the user must load the clips and then turn on the sound.",Adding some comments would help the user know what to do.,PS!,Thanks for not using the most annoying failure sound!!,"A lot of other patches use really annoying failure sounds and, since you end up hearing it over and over it gets really annoying.",So thanks for using something that's not horrible!,"There is nothing technically wrong with the patch, however, the patch only needs one sound control, you don't need a second exdac object.","It has a logical flow, but there are two ending speakers that it can lead to.",This could have been simplified.,"There is only one comments, and it is not specific enough if the person is unfamiliar with the program.",It is very simple and not particularly interesting in any way.,I am somewhat bored by the simple sounds.,There are two ending speakers/end points.,This could have been simplified to making it only one speaker.,They could have left in the comments what key number 100 is.,The patch looks very clean and well put together.,"The patch works perfectly, the D key plays back a ringing bell while all the other keys play back a snair drum.","The patch is impressive and works well, I think that they even added in some extra steps along the way that made the patch even a little cooler.","The patch feels simple and clean, seemingly trying to be easily understood rather than technically efficient.",It feels great to use.,"The sounds are simple and quick, making it easy to identify what key I've hit.",The sounds end quickly which gives enough of a response to know if I hit the right key or not.,"The patch uses two different sfplay~ objects, one for success and one for failure, which makes the patch look easier to understand even if not as technically efficient.","I've learned that simplicity can come from making it technically less simple, although it's not surprising or exciting.",I am not sure what could have been done better.,The patch looks simple and logical.,"The experience is simple and mechanical with little conceptual salience, but there's still a sense of elementary investment in the patch's function.","I'm happy when I hear the ""success"" song instead of the ""failure"" song.","There isn't any major technical innovation here, but everything works fine.",The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.,My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy.,It was difficult to find the key because it wasn't a letter.,So I just pressed every key till I could find it.,"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting.",I didn't learn anything from it.,They couldve added extra sounds to make it better.,Very simple and easy to read vertically from top to bottom.,Same as in class.,"Simple coding like in class, nothing different other than the sound files and the correct key.",The comments on the side somewhat gave away the correct key though.,"I mean, I know it was there for the coder's purpose but for someone who did not know and was trying to figure it out, I would have renamed the sound files to something more incognito as well as the comment.",The patch looked very nice and professional.,"It seemed to contain all the correct pieces and buttons so based on appearance, I would give it an A.",I thought the sounds were very creative.,"Now I had my volume on super loud so my first press and the ""W"" key was a bit shocking but after   the initial shock I was good.",The sounds themselves were actual song pieces which I really enjoyed.,"It was entertaining, energetic, and I would have fun playing around with this patch.",This particular patch looks very professional to me.,It is as cleaned up as it can be.,"As I have said, I did enjoy the fact that they added songs in place of a voice for the yes and no key.","Did I learn how it was done based on the patch itself, no.","However, I am no eager to do so.","Honestly, there is not much more to be done to this patch to perfect it.",It's self explanatory and easy as can be.,The folder wasn't labeled so I had to open it to see who files I was looking at.,The patch was very simple and clean.,There are a couple of toggles that I didn't see the purpose for.,The patch was simple and easy to navigate.,The sounds are entertaining.,I found the coding to be basically the same as shown in class.,The two extra switches I thought maybe could have been removed.,The sound was original as well.,"The patch appears to be very nice, and well put together.",The patch works fine and emits both a yes and a no sound.,When getting the right key it plays a sound very similar but more inviting then when hitting the wrong key.,The bad key has that weird ambient noise and good key is more like an electronic music tone.,The patch is good it takes two different types of sound to play which is a good mix.,this is a good patch it combines two different type of sound and its cool to listen to.,"This patch is another short and simple patch but i feel like it needs more room to be able to see more clearly, since it is a short assignment it does not hurt to spread them out a bit more.",The buttons used are great and they get the job done right with the sounds.,The no sound is a simple gong which is better than just saying no and the yes button is cheerful music like the type you receive when you beat a level in a video game.,The program worked perfectly and it was interesting to hear different sounds and nothing repetitive.,All they have to do is spread their projects out more in future projects.,This patch was very clean and put together nicely.,All components were accurately described and neatly placed.,"When running the patch, I couldn't get the sounds to play unless I clicked the ""ezdac"" object.","This may be a Max thing though, so I wouldn't discredit the creator for it.","Prior to critiquing, I had been listening to music, so when the evil laugh played, I actually jumped a little in my seat because it was so loud.","I got a laugh out of it, and smiled fondly when I found the right key and recognized the Beavis and Butthead(or what I assumed them to be) laughs.",The sounds are goofy with a touch of terror that still has my heart pumping a bit from the surprise.,"One thing is for sure, I'll be turning my sound down a bit when moving on to the next critique.",The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup.,It followed the tutorial correctly.,"As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising.",I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done.,"The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts.",In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it.,It's very simple.,Text states clearly how to make the patch function and what it will do.,It's entertaining.,The laughter provokes memories.,"The ""bad key"" is kind of creepy while the ""good key"" is humorous.",I like the simple layout and the description used to navigate the user into understanding the patch and what it does.,"They approached it the same way we approached it in class whereas one key is good, and the other key is bad.",They could have made more good keys.,Pretty simple patch.,Not complicated to look at.,The good key is pretty entertaining with the beavis and butthead laugh.,It was just like the example in class.,"Looks similar to the example in class, easy to follow, uses the open features along with the names of the files.","Very entertaining to use, made me laugh just like the patch did, and it was easy to tell which key was the odd one out.","The audio was the most surprising thing, most of the patch looked similar to the class example but it was the audio that made it unique.",It's pretty basic and straightforward.,Lots of notes to let you know what's going on.,Simple.,"When I first hit a ""wrong"" key, I thought I'd hit a ""right"" one, in that the sound of the evil laugh seemed so much more final than the Bevis and Butthead one.","The whole thing felt a little goofy, but that's to be expected in a design that's all laughs.",The whole thing was incredibly straightforward.,"I'd have preferred something a little more out of the box, particularly when we were given some degree of freedom.","It works exactly how it was assigned, and I feel it's a little boring.",The look and feel is simple.,"The ""no"" sound was startling, and the ""yes"" sound was comedic and nice to hear.","The ""yes"" key wasn't a letter, but a number key, which I thought was interesting.",The patch looks similar to the patch made in class.,It feels generic.,"It feels like the 'no' feedback sound is too long and drawn out, yet the 'yes' sound is great and entertaining.",It leads to a really annoying experience until I get the right key.,"This student approached the assignment seemingly to complete it without adding anything new or special, so there is nothing surprising or exciting.","I didn't learn anything, as it wasn't unique compared to what we have done in class.",It's hard to say what could have been done better since we haven't learned much in class.,Looks and feels very similar to the patch built in class.,the good key sound is very entertaining.,the formula shown in class was used in this assignment.,"Before even using the patch, I could tell that program would run smoothly.","It was well laid out and designed, nice and clean.","After playing with the patch, I thought it was fun.",I liked the user's sounds a lot.,"I could tell the user is a goofy person because when you found the good key, it played the ""oooh-yeah,"" from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.",The patch technically speaking was basically the same layout as instructed in class.,"However, they did a good job overall.",I especially liked the sound files.,The patch was neat and organized.,But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.,The buzzer sound for hitting the wrong key was really loud and annoying to hear over and over again.,"Technically, the patch worked perfectly, but there was nothing exciting about it.",It's a very simple lay out.,"Very bare bones, and minimalistic.","No real explanations to what everything does, outside of the 'good' and 'bad' buttons, but the path to each part if pretty easy to figure out.","There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played.","The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game.",It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key.,It was a nice experience overall.,"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it.","Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me.",Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be.,"Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user.","Other than that, it was a pretty good patch.",its simple,the victory sound was a bit too long.,but i felt like i watching a movie intro or playing a game,it was pretty simple only thing i would have done differently would be shortening the victory sound file,"The patch is very clean, everything is laid out in straight lines and is extremely easy to understand.",There are no unnecessary elements in the patch.,The bad key sound is extremely annoying so it really makes you want to find the right button quickly.,I also liked how the good key's sound went on for a rather long time.,"It gave me a sort of Super Mario feel, similar to when the game is beaten and the credits start to roll.",They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements.,It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.,"It's a very simple patch, it's easy to understand the signal flow.","The failure sound is really annoying, I suppose that it makes the user more motivated to find the success sound, but the game requires hearing the fail sound over and over.","It would be better if it was a softer, shorter, less annoying sound, or had volume controls so I don't have to endure it.","This patch is very simple and easy to understand, but it isn't very user friendly.","Adding a few comments to tell the user to load the sample and turn on the sound, for example, would make the patch easier for the user.","The patch is a simple variation of the assignment, and looks very clean.",It is structure neatly from top to bottom and I know how the patch flows.,"The bad key is bad indeed, it makes you want to hurry and find the good key.","Now the good key is rewarding, I do believe it is from a video game and I cannot recall which but hearing it makes me feel as though i just beat an intense level of some sorts.",The patch was simple and straight forward with an ease of design.,"They did add a ""victory"" and ""loser"" aside to a ""yes"" or ""no"" which added to the whole video game music choice.",I did do a similar design and structure.,"Surprised to see something so simple, was expecting something a little more elaborate.",In general it was aesthetically clean and pleasing.,Very easy to use and the instructions in the information box made it clear as to what to expect.,"The sounds worked well, somewhat goofy but entertaining.",Generally effective even though slightly over simplistic.,"Seems as if they recreated the very minimum technicality needed to fulfill the requirements of this projects, fortunately the sounds were entertaining.",After looking at the sub patch I realize that there was a bit more thought put into than I realized.,Appreciated being able to go in and look at the inner workings of the project.,May have been fun to have some other sounds included.,"Always learning, realize I am going to have to up the ante next time!",This patch looks different from the other ones I've looked at so far.,It was definitely interesting.,I would assume this person has prior knowledge of Max as this patch appears to be a bit more advanced.,It was set up as a project with multiple folders  instead of a single patch.,I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to do.,"The directions were a little too cryptic for me, and while I might just be too new at Max, I feel like the average beginner might have been as confused as I was.",The sounds were kind of hard to understand as well.,"I could barely tell what either of them were saying - if it hadn't been for the note, I don't think I would have made out the ""amen"" correct key sound.","I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work.","Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment.",They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far.,My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds.,"I think that the patch that you made is pretty clean, and unique.",I didn't see the selective key in that which is an excellence idea to hide it.,"I think that the sound quality is a little bit poor, so I can hear a lot of noise.","The style of the music isn't in my area of interest, but I think it's pretty cool.","I think that the coolest thing of your work is that you used the sub patch, so you are able to hide the ""Good key"" form the user.",simple yet obviously complex,very goofy but really creative.,they did something nobody else did.,a step up from the orig.,assignment.,"This look is completely different from the rest of the patchers i have seen today and it is very unique and makes me wonder what it will do, it comes with instructions on how to use it  and it has a short simple design.",It seems like an advanced form of patch because i did not quite  understand how to get it to work.,It says that the sound file is amen and in order to play it you have to from a new word from the word amen.,It is a bit confusing.,I eventually got it to work after reading the instructions carefully but overall the patch itself looks short at a glance and there is a sub patch that actually does all of the work in it and i think that is pretty fancy.,Pretty simple patch.,Not complicated.,I cant get the sound to load at all.,"I dont know if the problem is on my end, but the last patch worked for me.",Couldnt get it to work.,"The patch looks well organized in terms of visually clean, the connectivity of the patch is very sharp and visually appealing.","The terms associated with the yes, patch are sounds that would be an obvious strong indication of the, positive, ""yes"" or negative ""no""keys.",Prior to interacting with the program I couldn't actually see the speaker connected to the rest of the model or the meter.,"The functionality is simple to use, which is great.",There was a voice recording of the word hallelujah and a voice recording of word your wrong.,"Even when I had my volume on high they were still hard to hear, and the word, ""your wrong"" was very hard to make out.",I think the simplicity of the words chosen is good because it is obvious as it relates to this project.,"I feel the user experience would be straight forward in terms of the literal, ""good key/bad key"" assignment.",Technically the patching looks fine.,"It looks like the assignment was followed exactly, the only thing I did not see was the meter.",I did not see anything out of the norm in terms of a new feature or function that was not assigned.,I really do like the visual aesthetics were very appealing.,I did not learn anything new from the way the programming was completed.,"I think would could have possible been improved was just the recording sound of the wave files, they were just really low.",The patch is clear and easy to use.,"I like that there is a button that I can press to activate the wav files instead of hunting for the Š—“good KeyŠ—, or an ascii code map.","I like the meter and the level meter attached to the sfplay object, it helps to know that the sound is playing.",It is cute and funny.,"I like that the bad key sound is ""aintŠ—È nobody got time for this"" and that when you find the ""good key"" it rewards you with a strong Š—“yea!Š—.",The sounds were very fast and clipped very tight.,It made it feel abrupt.,The first thing I noticed was there were no comment boxes.,The coding was not complicated but instead met the minimum requirement and was straight forward.,"I like the patch, it is clean and simple.",I like the color sound meter.,I love the sound.,The audio is an actual person talking not just tones.,The overall feeling I got when looking at the patcher was that it was cleanly laid out.,My personal preference would be to line up the edges of the bottom boxes with the edges the message patches above.,A minor point!!,I figured out how to open finally!!!,Catchy recordings,lThis is the basic minimum nothing was done beyond the tutorial,"It is small and compressed, which I like, but the opening window was very large.","It it clean and well placed, easy on the eyes.","However, there are no comments, which would make it difficult to follow.",The sounds are very goofy.,It made me visibly smile.,I like the choice and enjoyed it.,"The coding assignment was formatted and completed the same way as it was done in class, but there was an additional sound meter added.",They could have left comments such as what key number 97 is.,"I think that the patch that you made is  clean, and well organized.",I love the music that you picked.,"The quality of the sound is pretty good, and the style is really unique, and not clich’©.",I'm really enjoy playing this interactive.,"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really impressive music, however I think that you might be able to try something more advance or more creative.","Looks like the class example, clean and easy to read.",only thing that differs a bit is the volume control.,"Feel very simple to use, the only thing was the volume control has a setting so at first even when I turned the speaker on I couldn't hear it.",After a little time I was able to figure it out.,"The sounds varied a bit compared to the class example, it was a little more pleasing then hearing just ""yes"" and ""no"" over and over again.",It felt rather complicated and guideless.,It felt confusing due to the lack of directions on the sound bar.,"With that, it lead to the patch being rather complex.","It was approached in a different way than what the lecture taught, which is always welcome.",What the creator could do is to explain the features of the patch so new users don't get lost on it.,"The presentation is very plain, and looks like they didn't customize it.","It is kind of symmetrical, but it looks like they finished it and didn't experiment.",The sounds didn't work for me at first and I had to mess with the live.gain~ function before it made any noise.,The actual audio clips were nice and soothing.,"They used the live.gain~ operation, which I was unfamiliar with, so it's cool that they tried something different.",But it didn't play sound at first which is basically all it needs to do.,"They are also the first person who didn't have the YES key blatantly showing, so that's great.",It is minimalistic and neat.,It feels easy to follow if you know introductory knowledge of Max/MSP.,"I'd say it feels like the ""average"" good key bad key game where you quickly sort through the key choices until you find the right one, guessing roughly where it might be based on the key print feedback.",It feels a bit more beautiful than goofy based on the audio feedback.,It still leads me to feel mildly amused and more engaged with playing with the audio as it's a bit more appealing.,This is another bare bones basically and neatly structured patch.,"If they wanted to do more they could have used background colors, made the key a bit more difficult to find with key combinations, and other slightly more complicated additions to the game.",its simple,i couldn't get it to work with keyboard buttons just the on screen buttons but i liked it still and the sounds were simple yet effective,only thing i would change would be to get it to work by pressing keyboard buttons,It looks like there is no actual selection operator for the good key or bad key.,There are comments however but they didn't seem to relate to the content of the patch.,"My question is: were they trying to use the MATCH object, but didn't use it successfully?",Did not work.,There was no operator to select a good or bad key.,"The wav files were pleasant to  listen to, a soft ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" with a very nice voice.",It made me want to use the patch but I could only press the open operator to make the patch play a sound.,"Not adequate, extra simple patch and concept but it still did not work.",The patch looks well organized though I am not entirely sure the purpose of the boxes that say what is.. and awkward.,It is easy to understand the flow of the code.,"I was not able to make any sounds happen, and I did not see a select function used so the program seems to be struggling to complete the required code.","It is easy to see where I am typing, however.",It was fairly straight forward so I did not learn anything new in the coding.,I think to do this better the author could have added the select message to operate the program to make sound.,"I think the clarity was well accomplished, and in the future they can focus on being more technically intense.",Code not complicated.,I could not get the sound to work with the keyboard.,Only by pushing the open buttons on the patch.,I am not sure if this is a problem on my end though.,Couldn't get it to work properly.,"It looks very basic, much like mine.",I could not get the keys to trigger sounds.,"They did the basic requirement, but I was unable to trigger the actual sounds.","Feels like the class example, simple to read, and this one has text boxes with directions which make it a bit easier to read.","Sounds were entertaining, I enjoyed the ""whoosh"" a bit more than the ""yes and no"" shown in the example.","Coding system similar to that of class example, only difference was the sounds, maybe a few different sounds added in to the mix would have helped.",The patch looks nice but with a few extraneous pieces.,Unfortunately there is a note telling me exactly which key is the right one so I didn't have to look for it.,It kind of defeats the purpose of this patch.,The sounds were unimpressive.,They are just two random noises.,"They don't feel ""right"" or ""wrong"".","If I didn't know what the patch was supposed to do, I wouldn't even know if I had hit the correct key because the sounds are just random, no good or bad feeling to them.","Technically, the patch was perfect.","Though there was nothing original about it except the sounds, it did what the assignment asked.",The feel of this particular patch is very clean cut and to the point.,The symmetrical alignment of the objects helps create a simple yet effective vibe.,"Using the patch, I didn't ever feel like it wasn't working well, however, I was not really engaged.","I didn't truly enjoy searching for the ""good key"" because the sound font didn't draw in my interest.","This lead to a one-dimensional experience as in, I was just observing the functionality of the patch.",The coding assignment was very similar to the screencast.,The one exception being that they placed buttons before the 'open' messages.,"For someone who was unfamiliar with Max or any kind of code, I felt it enhanced the patch from a visual aesthetic and also let the user clearly see what the patch was doing.",I think that this was where I was forced to wrap my mind around something.,Some could argue that the buttons are unnecessary and it might have a pure simplicity without them.,"It looks and feels a bit complicated, as if there is too much going on the screen at once.",Both 'yes' and 'no' give a response that I would expect.,The 'yes' is positive and the 'no' is negative.,"The student added in an extra tool for showing the audio level, yet besides that, there is nothing surprising or exciting.","It seems that they tried to add more to it, even with the little we have learned in class.",It's hard to say what could have been done better.,"The patch is laid out well, and looks nice.",There are lots of comment boxes and everything is a nice distance away from is each other.,The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits.,The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.,"I really like how things are laid out in this patch, it is pleasant to look at.","They did show the winning key however, which doesn't make the game much 'fun'.",There are some added functions like the meters which give the patch more personality.,"I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized.","I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me.","I think that the sound that you picked is really funny, so I'm really enjoy using it.","I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music.","The most impressive thing in your project is  a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative.",This patch is neatly arranged.,"I noticed that in addition to the regular meter, they also had a level meter, which was new.",I think the sounds used where really unique.,I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites.,"I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick.",The patch was straightforward and easy to use.,"I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds.","Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill.","I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project.","One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off.",It looks like the patch that was assigned to us!,"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second.",That was clever actually.,"The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea.","Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons.",And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea.,"It looks pretty basic, with some added features like the meter and color feedback from the bangs of incorrect and correct key choices.",It's amusing that they used the traditional mac error sound and the other sound for the correct key press was generally pleasing.,"It feels pretty easy to use, mildly aesthetically and audibly pleasing and neatly organized.","It gives a pretty good experience, but this game gets old pretty quickly after you've played it a handful of times.",They did more than the minimum for this assignment so kudos for going through the little extra effort to beautify your patch.,I learned I could easily have added color to my patch for a slightly more pleasing experience.,"Also, people will definitely hate my ""wrong"" sound and that's sadistically pleasing.","Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class.","The sounds were entertaining to listen to;  ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to.",Nothing very exciting or surprising was noticed in this project since all elements of the assignment were similar to the instructor's design.,The look and feel was simple.,"At first I thought my computer wasn't working because of the generic sound that Mac's usually make when a key doesn't work, but it was actually the ""no"" key.","The patch was simple, one ""yes"" key.",Looks like it could be tighter/organized slightly more.,At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think.,Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.,The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.,"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you.",The overall look is simple yet amazing.,One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.,The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout.,I actually did learn how and where they acquired the sound bar from because i could not find that for my project which i know would have been helpful for those who maybe could not hear it.,The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean.,The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.,The sounds are goofy and funny.,They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to.,It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.,They approached the coding assignment very typically.,The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class.,They added the meter for extra flare.,I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.,Looks very basic.,It was kinda funny.,The militaristic samples rose a chuckle out of me.,They did the basic requirement.,long code.,conceptually it was compartmentalized.,there are several ways to code.,this student opted to keep things seperate instead of coding together.,very truncated.,goofy.,the sounds used are goofy.,abrupt.,"Others took time to make the code elegant, long, or truncated, but you could see the connections.",Inputs & outputs.,None are seen here.,"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles.",There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain.,The patch didn't feature a comment telling me which key was the right key.,I was forced to push buttons in an attempt to find the right one and the no sound became annoying.,I didn't really enjoy the search because of the no sound.,They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked.,"I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code.",I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing.,"Small boxes in general, somewhat squishy and close but it does not take away from the performance of the patch.",Same like the one in class.,Seriously kind of aggrivated.,"I understand why the coding was so squished now, because the key to activate it was control and the v key.","And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay.","When I finally heard the correct sound I was a bit confused, but I guess it makes sense it was talking about teeth and having silver plates on them or else it could cause gingivitis?","I don't know, didn't understand that joke..","Since it was condensed in size, it definitely took more time to find the right key(S), PLURAL.",It was definitely surprising because I literally went down the rows of keys trying to match the numbers.,"I learned that to be sneaky and troll people, don't show all the connections so that people can get frustrated and slam their keyboard...no I didn't do that..",I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together.,There's space!,Use it!,"There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why.","I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no.""","The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works.","So, the ASCII code for their selected value is 22, but that doesn't actually correspond to a keyboard input, so it didn't actually function in the way I would hope.","The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot.",But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make.,"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately.","The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch.","This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow.","Firstly, the sounds are fantastic.","The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"".","Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity.","The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user.","Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly.","Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch.",Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking.,"The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel.","The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly.","I thought the user experience was overall very strong with this patch, not only from visual aesthetics, but from the functionality as well.","The sounds were entertaining, especially the good key.","The sounds were definitely goofy, which make the user interface more fun.",This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well.,"I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well.","I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job.","Looks similar to class example but minus the ""numbers"" box to see exactly what number this was, this made it a bit tougher.","The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file.","Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome.",The patch itself gives off a very good feel.,It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.,I really liked this patch.,It was super creative and the sounds were perfect.,The good key sound is one that continues on its own for quite some time so its as if it is actually speaking to you and I personally thought it was very funny.,This particular patch makes me want to try harder and make more creative and funny sounds.,The patch followed the guidelines perfectly.,This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing.,"However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently.",Simple and not as developed as it could have been.,On a positive note it was not intimidating.,"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key!",The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait.,Nothing new from what we did in class and they layout could have been a little tidier.,May have been cool to add some graphics?,A good reminder that we need to push our creativity if we want to come up with something truly original!,The patch looks very simple.,Easy to understand what is intended.,I was not able to get the patch to run.,"However, the description that was provided makes the patch seem like a very neat idea.",I liked that the idea was musical and hope to see something like this that works.,The patch was approached as expected.,"However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting.",Doesn't look like its going to work.,Couldn't get the code to work.,I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.,Couldn't get it to work.,"Looks good, everything all lined up.",I like it.,I could not get your keys to open and play.,When I unlocked it to check if they were linked to a file by double clicking on it nothing happened.,Not functional.,"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time.","No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it.",I honestly could not get it to play anything.,"I can open each .wav file in the folder to find out what I'm supposed to hear, but I can't replicate that in the patch.","There also wasn't a level meter, so I had no idea if sounds were actually playing or not, or if there was a problem on my end with my speakers.",I really wanted to know if I could play 'Sweet Home Alabama'.,There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through.,"I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something.","I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not.","The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it.",Clean looking patch,I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.,"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video.","Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input.",This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment.,The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.,"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well.","Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience.","Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work.","It was a quick experience, but pleasant.",The sounds were not obnoxious and nicely leveled.,"The sounds were traditional positive and negative sounds for guesses, so it wasn't an out of the ordinary experience.","Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box.","Everything worked as it should, and when it should.","Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual.","As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should.",I enjoy the use of different color buttons for notifying when the Good/Bad key is struck.,"Very simple, easy to navigate.",It feels very simple to use.,It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key.,I enjoy the sounds.,They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck.,I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.,I like the concise look and minimal use of space.,"The author still gives the message, but without a lot of looking around.","It feels like the author copied the template, made it more concise, and added their own versions of yes and no.",It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key.,I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain.,It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.,I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot.,The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through.,It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.,So far this patch is the smallest I've seen.,Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity.,It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together.,"This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before.",This one was actually a lot of fun!,I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's.,"I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine.",The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship.,I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily.,This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel.,I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.,This patch looked a little to clumped together.,I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys.,I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.,"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining.",Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher.,The space sounds blew me away.,This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment.,I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner.,"In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment.",But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly.,"Very simple, I like it.",The sounds are entertaining.,It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key.,At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded.,I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound.,It's very easy to use and navigate.,I wouldn't use sounds that have such similarities unless you are trying to confuse your audience.,It looks nice and simple.,Very small and compact.,The experience was OK.,The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing.,"For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect.","Like I said before, it was done very simply.",Which is always good.,The simpler the better.,"However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort.","If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost.","Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch.",at first glance the patch looked complicated.,however the patch notes were helpful.,This patch was very entertaining.,it almost had a soundboard feel and I just wanted to make custom mixes of train sounds.,the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.,It looks fairly organized and well constructed.,It feels very straightforward and efficient.,I think it works very well.,"The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice.",The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining.,I think the patch looks really cool.,I learned a few new things like the counter.,"As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good.",Great Job!,Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first.,I was unsure how it worked together.,I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.,The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid.,"Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds.","The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random.",I think you did a very good job technically working on this.,"Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works.","You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand.","After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys"".",Kind of confusing.,It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one.,"It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class.",I'm still a little unclear about how this patch works.,"Instead of just one ""Good Key"" there are two different ""Good Keys"" which play two different sound files of trains.","The ""Bad Keys"" play the sound of 2 more different trains that alternate back and forth every time you hit a bad key.","I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad.""","In total there are 5 different sound files present in this patch, which I kind of don't understand.","I wasn't able to hear the fifth sound, which apparently was a bell that was also supposed to match with a specific key.","I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other.",There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified.,I'd like it better if things were more organized.,I have to look in many different parts of the display box to see what is what.,The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion.,The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to.,The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over,They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom.,I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine.,I would at least organize the different objects.,Looks very simple and similar to the patch shown in class.,does not have any notes.,the experience is very simple but it works.,again.,very simple.,Simple to look at.,Nothing different or unusual about the  patch.,Basically what we learned in class.,There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.,"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key.",There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key.,Technically simple.,I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch.,It would have made it more fun to use.,"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around.","It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it.",It is the most difficult experience I ran in to because I could not find key 110 and the author did not tell me which one it was.,"Granted, if the purpose of the code was to find the key, then the author completed this marvelously.","I was also still able to listen to the sounds, and this helped further the appeal.","They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional.",This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way.,The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.,"The patch feels identical to the example, as for usage.","The sounds for the ""bad"" keys sound like a hi-hat or other cymbal on a drum kit, and the ""good"" key plays a full groove for almost 10 seconds.","Overall, it's simple, and does what we wanted it to.","Like I said before, it is virtually identical to the example from class.",I would suggest cleaning up the patch cords and organization of objects a little more.,The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing.,"The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed.",It looks user friendly and well defined.,The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design.,It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating.,"I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining.","The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key.","They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster.","I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components.","However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete.",The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch.,"For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece.","I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized.","I also saw that you have a decibel meter to measure the sound, which is really cool to me.","I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it.","I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music.",The most impressive thing in your project is  a decibel meter to measure the sound.,Looks very basic.,I liked the samples used.,"Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from.",Sounds familiar.,They did the basic requirement.,The patch is organized and well put together but there are a few elements that weren't exactly necessary even though they were in the example shown in class.,The sounds were nice.,"The ""bad"" sound did get a little annoying after a while but I've heard worse.","When I hit the right key, It was obvious because of the celebratory music with cheering in the background.",Though it was a little disappointing that there was a not telling me exactly which key was the right one.,It went against the purpose of the patch.,Technically the patch worked well but it is just the standard patch that was shown in class.,Nothing unique about it besides the sounds.,The overall look and feel of the patch is clean and visually pleasing.,It has a nice layout and has all the necessary components of a smooth working patch.,The sounds are funny and goofy.,"They have almost a cartoon feel especially with the ""no"" sound.",The good sounds is very funny because it is so lengthy.,One cannot resist but to listen to the whole entire song and then listen to it again because of it's entertaining nature.,They approached the assignment similar to the one done in class.,"They had similar components however, the sounds were different and not recorded but probably taken from somewhere else which was interesting.","Also, they added comments to the patch which is something I should have done to make the experience less confusing for users.",The patch was original in design and easy to use.,It is always nice to see alterations in project designs.,The patch was well thought out and the audio was entertaining to listen to.,"The audio files were noises that represented ""Yes"" and ""no"", so they gave a sense of similarity to that of what the instructor presented to the class yet still maintained its originality.","The design was enjoyable to the eye, yet it seemed that it could have been simplified if taken the time to do so.",I didn't learn anything from the construction besides that fact that there are multiple ways to design the same project (complexity vs simplicity).,The patch looks simple and streamlined.,The only problem I am noticing is that the creator of the patch didn't use the open message to open the sound from the beginning.,That requires the user to set up the patch before they can use it.,This seems like a large flaw.,The patch was approached as expected.,"The only thing that would have been better is if the creator used the message as ""open yes.aif 1""",This patched looked a little messier than the others.,"I noticed there were two different ""ezdac"" objects and two open objects without the file names in them.",Upon opening this patch was not usable.,I had to open/import the sounds myself in order to use the patch.,"That said, the sound files were labeled in such a way that it was not an issue identifying which went where.",The sound files themselves were very clear and pleasant to listen to.,The experience sent mixed messages because I wasn't sure if having the sound files opened automatically was a requirement or not.,"The patch was set up differently than the others, but it was done in such a way that things were more complicated than they needed to be.","On the day this assignment was presented to us, we were shown how to condense the patch so only one set of most of the objects were required, which this patch did not display.","Because of this and the lack of labeling, I don't think this patch would be very reusable.","Generally, my first visual impression was that it didn't look as efficient as it could be.",Not that I thought it might be dysfunctional but I would say just a little clunky.,"It feels somewhat inefficient as in I have to work to make the patch run the way it's supposed to and once I got that going, it was a pretty straightforward yes and no, although the yes was a refreshing 'ding' sound.",Overall it was a satisfactory experience with some kinks.,I would say the biggest thing was that you had to open the files yourself as in it was indicated in the patcher which files to open.,"Also, it was split into two columns so instead of using just one audio player, there were two.","However, the other parts were functional and once you opened the files, it worked just like it was supposed to!",The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.,My experience with the patch is that it's very goofy.,It was difficult to find the key because it wasn't a letter.,So I just pressed every key till I could find it.,"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting.",I didn't learn anything from it.,They couldve added extra sounds to make it better.,Looks very basic.,The samples were funny.,They tried the basic requirement but I couldn't get any sound.,It looks simple.,It fulfills the assignment.,"could maybe be a little more compact, but doesnt really need it to be.","Generally, it was fine.",I did have to fix it though.,"There were spaces in the name of the audio files, and that is a no no, so I removed the spaces, and then it worked.",The sounds were cool and kind of reminded me of guitar hero.,"Aside from the fixing I had to do that I mentioned before, it was good.",It meant the basic requirements.,"The comment wasn't in a comment box, so that may be something to look into.","Other than that, keep up the good work.",The look of the patch is very visually appealing.,"It is in a hexagonal shape, there was definitely a conscious focus on design, which is reflected in this patch.",Very strong visually components definitely make the user more interested and engaged to interact with the patch.,"The cable lines connecting the patch to the speaker have a conscious focus on design as well, with the overlapping and defined peaks.",Conceptually this piece is very strong and it is designed in a way to really engage the user to feel comfortable interacting with the patch.,"I did enjoy the sounds, it sounds like these were keys to a guitar and feels very authentic because it is not recognizable.",I think the user experience is straight forward and through the tune of the guitar a indication of emotion is felt through the good/bad key.,This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well.,"I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well.","I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job.","I understand the allure of creating symmetry with the patch, which is probably why the meter was left out.","However, I think they still could have incorporated this in an artistic way to compliment the rest of the piece.","I feel this piece was visually and functionally very strong, therefore, I would challenge the creator to link music for the good/bad key that invokes more of an intense emotion.","Overall, awesome job!",The overall layout looks pleasant to the eye and not too complex.,It feels similar to the patch I made.,"Its a clear response when the keys are pushed, with cool sounds.",This patch was very similar to mine except a few small differences.,The open file location had the exact file location of the sounds which seems more efficient.,Extremely simple.,Which is nice.,Very goofy.,Dug it.,"They did the basic requirement but made it even simpler in appearance, which I dug.",Very simple/minimal,Didnt like the yelling the other sound was ok. so i didn't try it much,different first sound.,I want to enjoy the patch that sound made me mute it pretty quick,It is very plain.,"There is nothing but the bare-bones minimum of the essential ""key"" object and the ""ezdac~"" button while everything else is missing.",There is an explanatory note making sure the viewer toggles the sound button on.,I do not see the links to the specific sound files that should be played depending on the key being pressed.,It feel very basic when using the patch.,"There is no audio feedback, as in meters, when pressing a button; there is no feedback whatsoever when pressing the different buttons on the keyboard.","The sounds, though, are pretty goofy so entertainment value is a high point.",The assignment was left as it was demonstrated in class...with even less than that.,"It does the job of relaying good and bad keys perfectly well, and the sounds are fun, but it is extremely basic otherwise.","I think the coder just needs to fill up the patch page more, to show that there is more input feedback being done, and that will hold over the user.",Not much to look at.,I got it to work as the assignment describes.,It plays like it is supposed to.There is nothing I can learn from this patcher as I can not see how it works.,The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand.,Excellent font choice.,My experience with the patch is that it was easy to use.,"While it was easy to use, the sounds were very boring.","No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting.",I didn't learn anything from it.,"They couldve added extra sounds, and better songs, to make it an overall better experience.",The patch looks different than the one done in class.,It looks almost like a game.,I liked the feel of it because it looks very simple without any complicated components or anything.,The patch felt very fun to use.,It was almost like a game to try and find the right key.,I liked how the design was simple and there were only two buttons.,The sounds were also very funny and goofy.,"The ""no"" sound was almost like a cartoon and the ""yes"" sounds was a funny song from Shrek so the patch was very entertaining to use over and over again.",They approached the coding assignment differently than in class.,The technical elements were the same as they were looking for one key but the design was executed a little differently.,I learned that it is possible to make the design clean and simple as done in this patch and hope to implement this type of design in my patch as well.,The look of this patch is like a game that I want to play.,It is very clean and organized and has more of a sense of design to it then the other patches that I have seen so far.,"I like using this patch, it is fun and entertaining.",It made me want to keep searching for the right key until i found it.,I also really enjoyed the sounds that you used it really helped with the whole game experience and making it more fun.,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, the only thing new that I saw was when it was locked everything was hidden.",I would really like to learn how you did that.,I also think the over all look of the patch was much more clean then the others I saw.,The only thing I would work on would be to come up with more ideas to make the game more dynamic.,Everything is so big!!,and idk what the yellow lines on the bottom lead to/ if anything,the song is a little longer than necessary but i like how random it is,next time make it normal size i should have to scroll or shrink the page to fit it on my screen,"This patch is similar to that of the patch we went over in class with it having two branches, one for good key, one for bad key.","Both sides have one sfplay~ message, a meter, and a ezdac~.","The buttons are a lot bigger and in the center on top, there is a comment that welcomes the user to the patch.","In the center of the branches, there is another comment that informs the user what to do.","While using this patch, I thought that the sounds were really entertaining to listen to.",The difference between good key and bad key was very easy to determine and I thought that the sounds were really goofy and made me laugh.,The big buttons helped out a lot in giving visual feedback to me and even the subtle changes of buttons changing color helped out a lot.,"My experience was a fun one, actually.","Something that I thought that was interesting about the coding on this patch was hiding of almost all the elements, minus the button.",I did not know that you can hide all of these elements and is definitely something that I learned while going over this patch.,My only concern was that since most of the elements were hidden was that I could not easily click on the ezdac~ message in order to turn the sound on.,The patch had a very clean and professional look to it.,"This was because there were only necessary components in the patch, nothing extra.","Also, the patch was aligned to the grid and in a straight line so you could tell easily where the lines lead to.",The sounds were very professional.,"The ""yes"" sound was similar to the success sound of a computer or a machine.","The ""no"" sound also sounded like a robot machine sound.",The experience was very polished and professional.,The patch was cleanly executed technically.,They approached the coding assignment similar to the one done in class.,The patch was easy to understand and professionally done.,I could have added comments to my patch to make the experience less confusing.,This user's patch was laid out differently from the previous patches I looked at.,"He did not use any buttons and instead of one audio input, had two.",The patch was very refined and condensed.,"I enjoyed the good key sound, it was also ironic that the user choose the same good key as I did.","On a conceptual note, the program was fun to work with.",It was a good mix of goofy and fun.,I still found it interesting how the user strayed from the basic layout that was shown in class.,"I enjoyed how they completely eliminated the buttons from the patch, that definitely helped to clean up the patch and make it look more refined.",Pretty simple set up but easy to read and looks tidy.,Minimalist and functional.,Easy to use and had some cool sounds.,Made me want more sounds to play with and a audio sampler to start constructing some beats!,"Nothing too surprising here, they did add an additional speaker which was a bonus.",Could have added some additional colors or notes to engage the user more.,Another example of a good foundation but also a reminder to keep trying to find new ways to express patches in interesting ways.,It is very simple and very clean.,The connectors are compressed and smooth.,I like how clean this project is.,"However, the opening window was very large.","I like that there is a comment stating what key opens the yes sound file, making it very easy for me to figure it out, but it states it's looking for the ""~"" key (126) when it is actually looking for the ""`"" key (96).",It is interesting that there are two speakers though.,"Also, because it it compressed, it looked like the the sound meter was connected to the right bottom.","It could be pulled down more, so it does not have that overlap.",It was easy to figure out what key to type to find the (96) value.,"I was somewhat upset that it states it's looking for the ""~"" key (126) when it is actually looking for the ""`"" key (96).","This is the only project that actually states what key it's looking for, so it makes it more user friendly compared to the other projects.",Thank you.,The sounds are simple.,The ending section could have been simplified with one speaker output rather than two.,"The patch is set up in two different max windows and might cause for some confusion, but it not too difficult to follow.",The structure is still neat and flows well with good notation to tell the sound files apart.,it feels good but the added step of having to turn on the audio manually kind of seems unnecessary than using the computers audio on off.,The sounds are good and easy to tell which is good and which is bad.,"The ""bad"" key sound does keep playing even when the ""good"" key is pressed, not sure if it is suppose to be like that.",I thought I was in the movie Jaws and having a sip of Kool-aid.,They added some new aspects like sending a message outside of the patcher as to play the sound files.,"It was surprising but maybe a unnecessary in terms of functionality, but good in learning aspect.","The message out was a good thing to see, as well as different.",Very simplistic of a design!,I love it!,The clutter from the other designs are essentially non-existent with this design.,"The audio was enjoyable to hear; they were basic audio files that lacked creativity, but were better that ""yes"" and ""no"".",The user took the time to condense the design to the simplest form I have critiqued so far; very enjoyable to see such an original and simple design.,I learned that I could have condensed my own project even further to achieve the same results.,The only thing I would like the creator of this patch to do better is to bring more enjoyable audio to future projects.,"Overall, great job!",Really nice.,Great use of a sub patcher so that the presentation of the patch is nice and simple.,The bad sound was very entertaining.,The good sound was very nice at giving positive feedback.,"However, I feel that the bad sound was a bit too long to get the intended experience.",They used a subpatcher which makes the entire process seem more streamlined to a user who may not have as much experience in Max/MSP,This patch looks incomplete.,The patch could not play.,No sound no interaction.,Make sure the patch does work before submitting.,This patch does not look complete.,It appears to be missing the majority of its components.,I see only the speaker button and the top title key.,I am curious to see if it will actually function properly.,I was unable to get this particular patch to work.,The missing components were very necessary for this project.,It stated which key to press but no sounds came out when I did so.,There wasn't much of an experience with this patcher.,This patcher was poorly constructed.,Many of the buttons were missing so it was unable to produce sound.,One of the keys linked to another patcher.,That patcher had a better set up but still failed to produce sound.,I would recommend re-doing this patcher to get the hang of it.,I was struggling initially but I just put up the tutorial video and it walks you through everything.,"This patch is also very compact and concise, consisting of only the music button and the main patch button.","They tell me right away that ""C"" is the good key which takes away from the process of attempting to find the right one among all the buttons on the keyboard.","I try to turn the audio on, but it does not stay on so I cannot receive the sound from pressing the keys.","I listened to the audio files on audacity, and the good one seems very bland with two different levels of clapping while the bad one has a slightly Terminator-like techno doom sound to it.",As the audio button does not toggle I can't really say the experience is positive.,"They approached the assignment as it was done in class, though they added the specific audio level object into the patch.","The patch probably works fine, but they just need to first debug it before submitting it as their final turn-in.",It didn't look complete.,No sound.,It wasn't finished.,It felt like minimal effort was put into it and it looked that way for sure.,It didn't feel all that good and was very confusing to work with to boot.,The creator seems to have approached it rather lazily as the sonud file didn't stop when another was played.,It couldv'e been a lot more involved akin to how the lecture did it.,What would also help is to put a note on how to work the volume on the patch.,Super Simplistic to look at.,I had never seen the gain~ object so that was interesting.,I cant help but feel that something is missing.,It didn't work.,I looks like a gameboard the way it is laid out,The sounds are goofy.,It was fun to operate,Nothing out of the ordinary beyond the label graphics.,Just another example of the basic tutorial for this assignment,"Initially, I was pretty impressed with the overall aesthetic.",There was thought put into the placement of each object and also a color scheme that was present throughout the entire patch.,Not only that but it felt like I was about to play a game.,I was pretty excited especially with most of the text being in all caps!,It was refreshing to see something that had character to it.,Clearly it took some thought but it is still so simple and familiar.,The sounds really surprised me.,"For some reason, I was expecting a human voice just saying the words but to have the actual animal noises was quirky and fun.","Honestly, the goose sound is ridiculously satisfying.","Overall, I had a lot of fun.",The coding is fairly efficient.,The buttons may be unnecessary before the 'open' messages but I imagine they are more for the visual appeal.,"I did not know that you could create objects in different colors, I would really like to learn how to do this.",Looks very neat and organized.,Very colorful.,It feels great to use.,Even tried to make a game out of it.,The sounds are very entertaining.,Though the duck noise gets very annoying after a while.,"It was very goofy, yet beautiful at the same time.",This person approached the coding assignment very well.,"Yes, they did something surprising and exciting by making a Duck Duck Goose game out of it.",Nothing really.,"It looked different than other patches, and felt more welcoming.","The look was cool, graphic/text wise.","The sounds were like a game of ""duck, duck, goose.""","It was an interesting take on the sounds, and I liked the basic look to the patch.",It feels nice and symmetrical but with some parts maybe being a little unnecessary.,The sound profile is definitely different and that makes it more enjoyable but there are still only two sounds.,Overall I'd say it provides a decent experience to users.,"Unfortunately, I think this may be the weakest part of this patch.","In the open messages, it is not said what to open so you have to tell it yourself.",An interesting thing they used is attaching a '0' to both play functions as a stopping method.,I think they could have made this patch more efficient by cutting down on unnecessary objects such as two audio players.,The connectors are overlapping and there is a lot of clutter.,It is a bit confusing.,I cannot understand or follow what certain parts are suppose to do because there are no comments.,I am unsure how to approach it.,I am still unsure how properly to use the project.,"I tried to use the buttons and keys on the board, but I could not get either of the sounds to open.",I was confused.,The sound files are not opened in the project and there seems to be unnecessary pieces (the 0).,This could also be simplified by only using one speaker output rather than two speakers and having two end points.,"In addition, there could be a sound meter, so that the user could see if there was a sound output or not.",They could have left in the comments what key number 27 is.,The patch was complicated with quite a bit of extra stuff.,There was no comments in the patch.,The patch had a nice design to it.,I didn't get sound from the patch at all.,I ran the window and it stated no file open.,The patch did not work at all.,I would have cleaned up the patch quite a bit.,I also would have added comments.,"The overlook of the patch is quite different than the others, as this patch did not condense the good/bad key functions to automatically telling the patch to play the good or bad key prompts.",Instead you would have to click on the open feature and choose the wave file in order for it to function.,"This is ok though, because we were not given the specification to take it further for simplification purposes.","Although, aesthetically I feel if the patch was taken further and programmed this way then visually it would be easier to follow.","The multiple lines interacting with both speakers (crossing over the open box) , etc., make it a little visually confusing to follow.",Conceptually it definitely flows in terms of functionality and visual appeal.,"It is designed in a way to be very user friendly, which allows for a strong user interface experience.",I thought the bad key was really funny.,It sounds like someone just making an angry sigh.,The good key sound really did not invoke any feeling.,"Technically, as mentioned above I feel the functionally works fine for the assignment requirements.","However, I feel if the additional measure was taken to create automatic buttons the active the good/bad key would have made it more user friendly and visually appealing.","I definitely feel that you met the requirements of the assignment, I just challenge you next time to take it a little further for simplification of the user interface experience.","The patch isn't as clean as most of the others I have seen, however, that is also personal preference.",The connections are very crossed and seemed tangled.,"The patch was interesting, the user used the same sound as one my previous critiques did.","The sound was goofy, which gives me the idea that the user is funny and goofy.",The only problem I had with the patch was finding the good key.,The patch functioned pretty well and the coding seemed to be correct.,"The only issue I found was finding the good key and that the bad key sound was the ""ooh-yeah"" because it made it confusing for me.","Overall, the patch did work and function well.",From the start the patch looks definitely more complicated than the others I've seen so far.,It's clear that they assigned a couple of different sounds to multiple keys.,I think this will be fun because that means there will be multiple bad key sounds rather than just one.,Overall the patch looks a bit clustered but you can still make complete sense of what is going on.,"Well, listening to all the different sounds was a lot of fun, but I actually couldn't find the good key which makes me sad because I wanted to get to hear the sound.",The sounds are very entertaining it was fun trying to figure out where they were from.,This patch is a very clean design for how much it looks like it can do.,The look of it was thought out and the feel of the patch is very interesting.,I love the sounds I think they are really entertaining and fun to play with.,I kept pushing them to see what the right one was and It was fun!,"The only think I don't understand is what the ""yes"" key sound is.",Either the sound isn't a clear yes or I just can't find the key which is really frustrating.,I think the patch is technically very well put together although I'm not to sure what key is your yes key.,It looks like it is number 1 on the keyboard which would be on a long keyboard but not a Mac.,This is something you need to think about in your design especially while designing a game because if some users aren't able to play it to its full potential then it ruins the experience.,I really liked how you connected all the numbers together to say different sounds I didn't know you could do that before.,"I think the only thing you need to work on is making a ""yes"" key that I can actually press.",The patch looks complicated.,"Many different number outputs are attached to each of the different sounds, all except one appearing to be different bad key messages.",The patch is quite simple in its association of specific button numbers to each individual message and using it is fun because each audio clips is varied and hilarious.,"The bad key messages are all that will be heard, though, because there is no specific button for the good key message; I tried every button three times to make sure.",The programmer was very inventive in creating many different audio playbacks and linking them to specific keyboard presses.,From viewing the patch I saw that they simply used the select command with the specific numbers of the different keyboard buttons and included them all while linking it to the open sound file command.,The only thing that must be done differently is that one of them must be made the good key button.,"The patch does look a little cluttered, but I am still able to figure out the flow.",A lot of numbers on the screen may cause confusion.,"The patch works great and the multiple sound files keep you entertained and the ""good"" key was hard to find because i'm sure a laptop keyboard does not have a home button.","The Simpson's kept popping into my head the whole time while searching and then I found the ""good"" key and it was not something I expected, good surprise.",They used the in-class template and added multiple sound files for certain keys.,It was a nice change from the normal patch done in-class.,I did learn how to incorporate multiple sound files from this patch.,"They could have organized it a little better, even by just spreading out the patch and giving each line some space, comments may have benefited here.",Right off the bat I am very overwhelmed with this patch.,There are 27 different sound files present.,"But structurally, it seems to be pretty well organized and I do enjoy the fact that there is some color and text formatting in this patch.","I discovered that every letter key on the keyboard is assigned to a different one second snippet of a popular song, either singing ""ooh"" or ""mmm"".",There are 26 different song snippets and one sound that plays when any other key is pressed other than a letter.,"Some of the songs I actually recognize and enjoy, so this patch was definitely entertaining.","In fact, when you press a key that isn't a letter, a snippet of ""Mmm Bop"" by Hanson plays, which I found to be humorous.",I really enjoyed the concept of this patch.,It's definitely unique and it seems like it must have taken a lot of time to complete.,I liked how he/she incorporated music into their project because it definitely held my interest.,"I think the aesthetics still could have been improved a little, and maybe it could have been organized in a way that isn't so daunting at first glance.","This patch has a little different of a layout than the patch I created, with a more horizontal approach.",The sounds are pretty entertaining and the patch was functional in the sense that there was one good key and the rest were bad.,The layout was a little confusing to figure out at first but it didn't hinder from the functionality of the patch.,This patch made me look at setting patches up in different ways than what I would think.,This patch has several different clips from various different pieces of music.,There are a lot of different ascii number codes that also correspond to each clip.,"Also with this patch, there is a comment that has a link to the Spotify playlist for every single song that is involved in this patch.","I really enjoyed using this patch because I really love music and when I heard some of the clips that were used that I heard before someplace else, I smiled.",The sounds were very entertaining to listen to.,And I feel as though I had a lot of fun trying to figure out what sound corresponded to what key since there was so many of them.,"The way how the patch was approached via coding was similar to the way that we were shown in class, but at a bigger scale with all the different sounds and all the different ASCII numbers that needed to be selected.",Something that I learned from going over this patch was that it is possible to select multiple ASCII numbers for sfplay~ to use.,seems overly complicated.,frustrating.,just like randomly switching radio stations.,they used the same concept in class but elevated it to a larger scale.,SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED LOOKING.,"The connections are all over the place and I read the comments for instructions, but honestly, I'm not sure I did it right.",Well I managed to activate the first two sounds but had no idea what to do for the third one even after the comments.,I just hit the open the STE-022.wav file and listened to it then and pressed other keys and realized that the third sound would still play while in conjunction to the other keys pressed.,"Also, I'm not sure what the sounds meant in relation to each other.",Definitely someone who knows what they are doing or has been coding with this stuff for awhile.,"I understood the first couple of rows and then, THEN, there was some fancy diverter box looking thing that changed the sounds or whatnot?",I didn't get it to work.,I learned that it is possible to continue looping a sound and not know how to turn it off other than muting the sound.,Do better?,Make it so the continuous sound would turn off..,It looked different than most of the patches.,"The sounds were a bit confusing, more than one going at one time and for a long period of time.","I couldn't tell what the ""yes"" key was.","It was interesting using more than one sound for the ""no"" key, however.",Very complex compared to the in class instructions.,At the moment I cannot hear the sound files of any of the programs because I am not on a Mac I think.,Patch appears to be working correctly based on the buttons lighting up.,It was really cool how it worked.,You had to set the signals first and then select the right key and if wrong the signals would cross again.,"The patch is organized, but complex.",It's not immediately obvious what everything does.,The experience of using the patch is both strange and humorous.,"The interspersion of very long and cryptic spoken clips, musical files, and recordings from class suggests a conceptual purpose that might be made more clear by a more elaborate explanation.","Of course, the simplicity of the application doesn't demand as much intellectual engagement as it does interaction and exploration, so it ultimately feels like an interesting and successful version of the assignment.","The technical complexity of this patch is not as easy to explore or learn from as that of the others, but the patch is definitely an ambitious innovation on the instructions we received in class.","The patch experiments with a complicated system whereby different inputs are connected to multiple outputs, and outputs are returned to between different inputs.",Looks a little complicated.,Like there will be extra things happening for pressing one key.,But i think it will be cool!,"I like the narratives, chants, and excerpts from class that were put as sound files in the patch.","However, I don't which is the good or bad keys.",Maybe because it sounded so cool.,The code looked awesome.,And it worked without me having to do anything extra.,"The patch is very colorful with every object having a different color fill, and the respective links also being those same colors.","Those colors include red, green, blue, yellow, and of course the traditional gray.",Due to the color coding the patch seems highly organized with no links seeming to blend in with others and confuse the user of what they are connecting.,"The experience is quite interesting, and wholly unique in its itself from the other four I have critiqued, in that the goal is to find the sequence of keyboard presses that relay the sentence, ""Welcome, have a nice day.""","Many buttons say the welcome part and the rest of the sentence comes sequentially with the right presses; ""A"", ""S"", ""D"", ""F"" will elicit the words.","It's a very novel and fun concept, the dullness of each word takes away from it a little, and the lifeless pronunciation detract.","The patch, like many of the others, is very basic in design, with the specific key numbers being listened for for each word and the files connecting to the speakers.",The use of color coordination is a great idea in hindsight as it adds an extra element of organization to the patch and creates more visual appeal for the user/viewer.,More interesting sentences/livelier pronunciation of the words would greatly improve the project.,"This patch is a bit more colorful, where the ""open"" messages are concerned.",There appears to be 5 different sound files.,"This patch didn't actually work, at first.","The sounds were in an additional folder, and wouldn't play.","I had to move them to the same folder as the patch, as well as increase the volume using the slider that was input, before I got any feedback from the patch.","The messages from the keys were, ""have,"" ""a,"" ""nice,"" ""day,"" and ""welcome.""","If I didn't know anything about Max, this patch would have been useless to me, since it didn't work at the start and had no messages or comments for any steps to make it work.","Overall, the patching was fine.","Nothing super exciting, but having the sound files in a different folder led to an initial issue.","The patch looks extremely complex compared to what we learned in class, though it seems well organized.",I am not able to produce any sounds with this patch.,"There is an audio level bar that changes when i press buttons, yet I do not hear anything coming out of the speakers unlike the other Max patches I've seen.","This student seemed to add a lot and make something cool, still within the scope of what we learned in class.","I learned that there is a lot you can do with just what we have learned, though I didn't learn how it works.","It could have been made easier to understand for the average user, though the sounds don't work so it's hard to suggest anything.",Matthew definitely got creative with this one.,"My eye is automatically drawn to the five color coordinated segments in the middle of the patch, each with an assigned sound file below them.","I am intrigued because above these segments it says ""Have A Nice Day.""",Seems to be organized pretty well.,Excited to try it out.,"Not sure what's going on with this one, but the sounds are not working.",Therefore my experience with this patch as a user was unsatisfactory.,I think conceptually this would have been an interesting idea if the sounds had actually worked.,There must have been something wrong with the construction of this patch.,Next time I would suggest checking to absolutely make sure that everything is working before submitting your project.,The patch is well put together but there were a few things like the buttons that weren't really needed.,"The ""no"" sound was kind of annoying after a while and the ""yes"" sound was kind of anticlimactic.",With all of the screaming from the no keys I was hoping for a little more for finding the right one.,"technically, the patch is great, with a few things that could have been removed.","Still it was just the patch that we were shown in class, nothing original about it except for the sounds.",This patch is similar to that of the patch we saw in class.,"There are two branches, one for good key and one for bad key.","There is one sfplay~ message, one ezdac~ message, and a meter.",Both branches are labeled with Yes and No messages.,"While using this patch, I very clearly hear the difference between the sounds.",The bad key sound was that of a person loudly screaming.,"The good key sound was that of a person yelling, ""Woohoo"".","I would say that the sounds were somewhat silly, but the sound files were clipping and cracking which made it a very unpleasant experience when I was trying to find the good key.","I liked the clear difference between the two sounds, but the quality of the audio was not very good.",This patch was coded in a similar way to that of the original we went over.,The added labels of Yes and No did help me determine the different branches.,"Something that I learned after going over this patch, is to pay attention to the quality of sound, which was the only thing wrong with this patch.",This patch also looks basically identical to the example in class.,The patch feels exactly the same as the in-class example.,"The sound for the ""bad"" keys is some type of scream, and the ""good"" key sounds like Homer Simpson shouting, ""woo hoo!""",The patching and cords could have been cleaned up/organized a little neater.,"Otherwise, decent enough.",Looks as though it could be a little more organized.,There were no sound files included in the folder.,"Split the good and bad signals to two different ezdac objects, which confuses me a little because I don't see a reason for it.","I would've just used one speaker object instead of two, but to each their own.","There also was a third one, unattached to anything at all.",Just weird.,"Also, the .zip was just of a patch, and none of the associated files.",I wish I knew.,"There was no audio at all, as the audio files weren't included in the .zip.",There's some superfluous parts and also some critical parts missing - like the audio.,"This patch is layed out kind of similar to mine, but the layout is a little different than mine.",Some of the the little boxes are in confusing places.,"The patch recognizes the good key and bad key, but I was unable to hear the sounds when the keys were activated.",This patch uses the key selector and uses the open direct file location feature.,The eazydac and meter arent working though.,"This patch looked very disorderly, lacked comments, and had poor flow.",It looked like it was tossed together quickly and with reckless abandon.,"The file folder was named poorly, with two file extensions(both .maxpat and .zip).",This patch doesn't work.,There were no sound files included in the file folder.,I couldn't tell if there was much of an approach made.,"This person's attempt failed, unfortunately, and there isn't much to show for their work other than a jumble of objects.","In the future, they might find seeking help and double checking their work will help them out.","I think that the patch that you made is really clean, and well organized, but you didn't attach the music file.","Because you didn't attach the music file, so I don't who which file that you picked.","Don't forget to attach the music file, otherwise everything is fine","This one is appealing from the start because it is clean, linear, and tells me which key to press!",I like the comments to all parts which help me understand what the author was going for.,This patch also takes me to the future.,I enjoy the sounds which remind me of opening some kind of futuristic door.,I have an easy experience as a user because they tell me which button to press.,"Although visually appealing, it seems that they decided to create the patch without adding any of their own elements.",I enjoy the buttons as visual additions to the audio output.,Another that looks identical to the in-class example.,"Feels the same, because it basically was.",The sounds are kind of like computerized blips.,"The ""good"" key has two tones which go up in pitch, whereas the ""bad"" keys go down.","Overall good, but organization could be a little neater.",Simply done.,could have done without the 2 in sfplay.,"Other than that, it gets the job done.",It was basically the example patch we did in class.,However it used two cool sound fx's for the yes and no.,The experience was good.,"Nothing I didn't expect,.","This person didn't really do anything surprising or new, and I didn't really learn anything new.",Maybe they could have tried doing multiple sounds or something like that.,"Overall, it was what we were meant to learn and so it gets the job done.",Good Job!,The patch is pretty straight forward and looks like what we did in class although the connections are distracting because of the placement.,The patch is again very straight forward.,The sounds aren't that exciting and don't really draw me into keep playing.,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, there was nothing new added to this patch or nothing I could learn from it.",It was very straight forward.,"If you could do something better it would be to add another concept to the patch and also make the sounds more recognizable as ""good"" and ""bad"".",Nice use of patch cord layout.,Makes it seem a little more arty and less like a tool.,As if the patch itself was part of the product as a whole instead of a tool.,Way to use alternative colors on your buttons!,It stood out.,The sounds were silly and fun.,"However, I had to hunt down the ""good"" key, as it wasn't a standard alphanumeric character ( ` ).",It was a little out of the box and I appreciated it.,I loved the layout and the color changes.,It was proficient and fun.,"I might've liked to have seen some more reaching out in terms of numbers of keys and sounds, but I liked it otherwise.",Great patch.,Everything is simple and clean.,I like the sound for both good and bad keys.,"Very funky, cartoony sounds.",Fun to listen to.,The patch is good.,I like the sound and it's clean.,Really nice.,The feel of the patch is nice.,A UI or use of presentation mode would have been nice.,The process seems very swift.,The sounds are great.,I would utilize presentation mode to make the patch seem more functional to someone who has no idea what Max is.,It was good that used the message boxes to open the file rather than make the user set up the patcher.,Pretty basic.,"No color, no text formatting, nothing particularly aesthetically pleasing about it.",Seems to be well organized and includes clear instructions on the side of the patch.,I'm actually still laughing to myself as I'm writing this.,"The ""Bad Keys"" trigger a simple sound file of a little whistling noise accompanied by a man saying ""Nope.""","But when I finally found the ""Good Key"" it played a long sound clip of a crazy EDM song with a guy going absolutely nuts for the song exclaiming ""YES!!!","OH MY GOD YES!!!""",over and over.,"Aside from being hilarious, I'm also a fan of the EDM-dubstep genre which made me enjoy this patch even more.",The only thing that I would have changed are the aesthetics.,"Perhaps Stephanie could have added some different colors and text formatting to go along with the funny, quirky feel of the project itself.","The look of the patch is nice and clean, and very simple.","Each part is explained very clearly as to show the viewer what each patch does, so there is no guess work when looking at it later.","The 'no' sound made me laugh a little and was a little goofy, but in a good way.","The 'yes' sound was a bit loud, but it did give you a sense of triumph after button hunting.","It was easy to use, and since there wasn't a label as to what the 'yes' key was there was key hunting.","Thankfully, the 'no' sound wasn't obnoxious.","Technically, the patch was very simple and nothing too complicated.",Everything was simply spelled out so that there was no guess work as to what everything did.,"Since it was very basic there was nothing experimental added on to it, and nothing popped out as exciting.",Just a simple little patch.,It looked pretty easy to understand and felt clean to boot.,"It felt awesome, mainly due to the awesome choices in sound files.","It was definitely a pretty entertaining experience, that's for sure!","He approached it in a pretty creative way, and it definitely shows within the choice of the sound files.",Don't have anything bad to say as it was pretty awesome and easy to understand.,"This patch looked very similar to the example we did in class, except this student used two sfplay~ objects, and two ezdac objects.","I got no sound output from this patch, and couldn't figure out the cause for that error.","The sound files were in the right folder, my computer volume was up, the ezdac was turned on, etc.","It seemed that it should have worked, but alas it did not.","Cleaning it up a little would have been good, and making certain it works prior to uploading would also be good.",The patch is set up nice and structured from top to bottom in nice format.,Clearly tell where the patch will end up.,"Unfortunately i was unable to hear the sound from the ""good"" key and ""bad"" key.","In the ""open"" object they forgot to add ""open"" into the object, therefore it did not open the files.","I did add to the ""open"" object and it works but because of the two speaker outputs, both good and bad sounds play while the other is playing.","They went with the normal set up, but added another speaker at the end of the patch so there was one for both the ""good"" key and ""bad"" key, which seems redundant.","Fixing the ""open"" object is the main thing I see that needs to be changed.",Something doesn't look right.,Two sfplay~ objects aren't necessary.,Neither is two ezdac's.,"Has a nice flow to it, everything is labelled nicely.",It doesn't work.,They forgot the open command on the message.,They could have wrote the patch correctly so it could work.,This patch is very similar to the patch that we went over in class.,"The main difference is that instead of one sfplay~ message and one ezdac~ message, there are two for each branch, and there isn't a meter within the patch.",Everything in this patch is labeled with a message box.,"This patch was very easy to use, especially because of the label that is right next to the desired ASCII number code for the good key.",The sounds had a very clear difference on which was good and which was bad.,Good key was an audience cheering.,Bad key was the audience booing.,"Although, I feel as though the sounds were too long and tended to overlap a lot, especially the good key sound.","Yet, the open message for the sounds were not originally in front of the sound files, so the patch was missing this.","As I mentioned before, this patch was missing the open message in front of the sounds.","It is a very easy mistake to make, but it renders the sound files useless since Max will not just open the sound files on its own.","From going over this patch, I learned that I would need to double check my patches in the future so that I don't forget something.","Even if it's just one mistake, the patch is not going to function correctly.","From first glance, this patch looks like a standard good key bad key layout.",One thing I noticed was that this patch had 3 good keys rather than 1.,They did this by putting in a few different numbers in the key selector thing.,This patch uses the open files direct location to open the wav sounds.,"Since there are a few good keys, the keys specific code number are put in the key selector.",The patch itself looks very well set up.,It appears to contain all the necessary components and has a clear picture of what keys need to be pressed.,The sounds were so funny and enjoyable but they would not be produced by hitting the keys.,I had to click on the sound buttons themselves on the patcher to hear the sound.,"Though it looks to have everything that is needed, clearly something is missing or some important step was skipped.",They approached the assignment with all the right thoughts no doubt however the outcome failed to show it.,The set-up looks right but there was probably one small missed step.,I would recommend re-doing it and watching the tutorial while your doing.,That is what helped me so much but even I still did struggle.,Its best to do it perfectly once so they can learn from their mistakes.,"At first I was a little confused by the patch, however the comments that were added allowed me to figure out what was happening without much effort.",Kudos for that.,The sounds are great.,"I would have gone for a shorter ""fail"" sound since you end up hearing it over and over, but overall, good sound choices.","The patch is simply constructed, however in my opinion, the creator could have taken more care to line things up according to the grid.","There is nothing wrong with the sketch, however, I would have put the number selector on the other inlet for the ""select"" object, that way the user can change what key is the ""success"" key.",The filing was good and the folder named.,The patch could be cleaned up a bit.,The patcher is nicely labeled with comments.,The patch only works if I push the switches not the actual numbers indicated.,I think it could be slimmed down a quite a bit,The report format is good.,Try and label the equations below and state when you use them in the theory.,"Also its hard to tell if you used Microsoft equation editor, looks like it is, but I am not 100% sure.",Refer back to for example: equation 1.a was used.,"Add some more details on the theory, study, and conclusion.",Overall it is looking pretty solid.,Just some brushing up on the theory and how you coded it into MATLAB.,Good!,but you need to verify your code with a manual/hand calculation on the side to compare to what MATLAB outputs.,Overall very well written.,Goes in depth on the two equations two unknowns section and circle explanation.,"However, part of the project is to play around with the circle graphing code and to generate multiple sets of systems of equations.",Seeing more examples would be nice just  to see how the code plays out in different scenarios.,"Overall, I would give a 3/5 for completion and 5/5 for explanations and writing style.","For your report, you only partially completed the report.","The Introduction needs to have both a problem statement and a description of the study, you should expound upon what you have.","I do like your theory because you actually showed some of the mathematics of Newton's Method, but again you should explain the theory a bit more in depth, maybe go into more about the derivation because there is more to say.","You have some evidence in your Study and Results, but try to explain all the things your code accomplished including the polynomial results and your own unique nonlinear equation's results.","I think you could use the addition of more images, also make sure you create circles in your picture that match what the CP 1 Notes ask for.","Once you have completed your report, you need to update your conclusion.","I would also like to point out that you should have three codes for this computing project in your appendix, first is the polynomials given in the CP 1 Notes, second is the code for the two circles (which you have), and the third should be your own code with unique nonlinear equations.",Don't be afraid to explore the computing project more!,You need to repeat the code from the notes as well as do your own exploration of a system that you come up if.,I would focus more on Newton's Method than saying things about how it is a refresher on MATLAB and stuff like that.,I liked your report and really seemed like you knew what the project was all about.,"The conclusion should be longer than a sentence long, try going back to your introduction and reflect back on it.","Tell weather or not the we were able to complete the purpose of this MATLAB project, then why or why not?","Something along those lines, so it can help length that sections a little longer than a sentence.",Other than that it was a good one :),Your theory included all of the equations used in the project.,In order to enhance you project think about adding more to your study and results.,This section is suppose to be where you explain all of your findings though the use of the code you created.,Show the reader what the plots look like that you are talking about in your study.,Explain a little bit about each manipulation you made to your code and what you observed from each manipulation.,Then summarize all of your findings in the conclusion.,Also add a code verification section to your report  to ensure your code is working as it should be.,I like your introduction.,"It introduces the Idea of what I am going to expect in the report and makes a clear understanding of what you will show throughout it, nonlinear equations.","For the Theory, in your matrix, your second term in the top left equation is supposed to be 3x^2-3y+1 and you have 3x^2-3y^2+1 so check that and correct it.",You also may want to include the two equations used in the matlab code so that we see what the two circles' equations are.,"Your code looks good, however you do not have anything in there about the two points of intersection.","There is a part of the report that says: ""Note: this is the problem of finding the points of intersection of two circles.""",I think that is important so I would add them and graph it so that the two points are highlighted.,Also add that to your report and state what happens when you guess too far from the actual values.,"In your conclusion, It would be good to put something in there on your results of the code trials and anything that you think wraps up the tests done in matlab such as why there should be a maximum number of iterations for the program, the tolerance of the guesses, and then sum up what the nature of the convergences you found are.",The last thing that should be added is the two equations that you made up on your own.,The last thing that the report asks for says to propose your own nonlinear equations and have matlab solve them for you.,After reading over your report I feel that overall it is well organized and is reader friendly.,In the introduction you can expand more one what Newton's Method is so that it ties in more on what the project is all about.,"In the theory, I believe there are suppose to be 3 graphs.",You need to go back and look at the what CP1 is looking for.,You have one graph that looks correct but you need to display the intersection point.,Under the graph you need to label each figure and have a description of each graph.,The 2 others graphs you need to have has to show an increase in radii and another showing 1 solution.,"In the study and results section, first off you should capitalize ""Study and Results"" to look more professional.","In addition, your second sentence should be rewritten because it is hard to follow.",Reread the second sentence and reword it.,Other than that it looks good and has good depth in the section.,"In the conclusion section, it seems a little short.",You can expand on what you learned and how it scientifically relates to our studies.,Possibly talk about Newton's Method here too.,"In the appendix, I ran the code and it worked.","Once again, you need  to display other graphs (look back at the CP1 guidelines).","For starters, when submitting projects for peer review use your posting ID and not your name.","1.a) (points: 2) your equations are correct and look formatted correctly, however your going to need to add more details about how these equations are correct, show why you used the equations you used and why they work the way they do.","b) (points: 1) The bulk of the program is correct, however you didn't output the intersection points of the two circles or show the plot of where they intersect.",c) (points: 0) No evidence of Code Verification d) (points: 1) majority of program correct missing intersection points.,"2. a) (points: 2) Your study and

(points: 3) looks professional and nicely doneTotal Points: 28",I think that you have a good start on your computing project.,One thing that i would work on is to add a few more examples of outputs of your code in the study and results section.,You did a good job of showing where the circles have only one intersection point but i think it would be important to show how your code works with other examples of functions.,I like how you displayed your equations in the theory section and really went into detail describing what every part of the equation means.,Another thing that i would add to your report is the verification of your code.,One way to do this is to pick simple functions that can be worked out by hand and solve them yourself and compare your answer to the answer MATLAB gives you.,Another thing I would do is go back through your introduction and conclusions and make sure that they are smooth to read.,I felt like there were a few sentences that could be written a little smoother and be easier to read.,All in all i feel like you have a good grasp on the ideas of the project and have a good start to your project.,#NAME?,#NAME?,#NAME?,The graph should have dots showing exactly where the circle intersect.,#NAME?,#NAME?,#NAME?,Introduction: Link your sentences.,Theory: Well labeled and use of Figures.,Code Verification: Well done.,Could have made easier using WolframAlpha.,Computations: Was it necessary?,":)Study and results: Results were not shown.","Conclusion: Great, succinct.",Code: Well organized,"-Your ""Code Verification"" section was well done.","It was unique and also intelligent, for you didn't just verify the code by hand but you tested MATLAB.","-You stuck to 3rd person, which kept your writing very professional.","-One thing I would suggest adding is talking about what ""quadratic convergence"" means in your study section.",The second to last paragraph in the Computing Project 1 pdf suggests you discuss some things about setting a maximum number of iterations and such and I could not find your comments on it in your report.,"Otherwise, it was very thorough and great job!",Nicely laid out and good explainations,"Good overall, more organization well make it perfect.","Hello,Your report was well written and straight to the point.",Well done.,You could have expanded a bit more on the results you obtained when you inputted a different equation.,"But other than that, it was a really good report.",Congrats!,The code has shown a warning.,"However, it can be happening because it is copied from a PDF document.",The report is well organized and presented.,"It could be smaller than what it is, because it has unnecessary information.","For example, it talks about the situation in which it is chosen the center of the circle as a guess, but it does not explain why Newton's Method does not work in this situation.",It could be written with less information than it has.,Being more specific.,Overall I thought your report was very detailed and well laid out.,I could easily understand what the project was about.,the introduction was very good.,The only part I was slightly confused on was your theory.,It might be beneficial to have a different section for code verification just to make the theory a little more clear.,Also it would be nice to see what numerical values the code produces for some of the plots.,The report contained the equations implemented in the code.,The report also introduced and explained Newton's method and gave the reader a good background of the concept and equations.,The code was verified and different computations were done to show the program was exercised in different ways.,The quality of the report was great as it gave the description of study.,The presentation was great as well and was a good read.,The conclusions connected to study too.,This is the kind of report I wish I could produce.,Great Job!,Well explained.,Well thought out report.,Good!,     In this computing project report the introduction is very simple but at the same time it include the most important points of the project.,Also the theory is correct and in specific explanation by using equations and graph of circles in one and two intersection solution.,I thing this report in very good for other to follow the progress of the author.,"In all, this report have a great detailed explanation but at the same time it can be improved more.",    This Computing program report contains good explanation of the goal for doing the project.,Also the theory is correct and in specific explanation by using equations.,This report has very detailed writing about code verification.,I think this report is very easy for other to understand and follow the progress of the author.,One thing that this report can be improved is providing the intersection of the circle  that has only one solution.,"In all, this report is very good on detailed explanation.","Technical Accuracy: Introduction is informative, Theory is correct, Code is verified and running correctly and computations are done.",Good Job.,Interest and Insight: The study is good so far but I think you can do better by finding situations in which Newton's method only finds one solution or where no solution is found.,Quality of Report: It is a well written report but i don't think you're quite done yet.,Very good so far though.,Your introduction is clear and to the point of what we are trying to grasp through this first project.,"I think you need to introduce a little bit more of Newton's method in this section, however.","We understand that we are using his equation to find the intersecting points, but give a little background about how we go about introducing variables and such in this section.","In your theory, how does this program go about testing conditions and finally come about outputting the closest answer to the intersection?",In your study and results it seems that you are a little confused on the out put in your figure 1.,The resulting circles are not due to your g1 and g2 equations.,The resulting intersection points are computed through these equations.,You should define your circles in your report with the equations that you did in the code.,Your c1 and c2 equations cause the red and blue circles to appear.,You also need to look over your initial points in your figure 2.,You don't mention anything about the two circles only having one solution.,In your code it appears that every time you ran it there was always two solutions where the circles intersect.,in order to make it so there is one solution you need to relocate your coordinates of your circles and adjust the radii so they only intersect in one place.,You conclusion also needs to connect with your introduction a little bit more.,This report has the right theory for this project.,And it has organized program in order to run it.,also most of the code are correct and has error need to recode it.,This report has all the objectives.,And it need to complete in different sides of the project.,Conclusion is including all related objectives for this project.,I really like the style that when he or she started this report in ordered way,"Introduction and Theory are great, I would change the format of arranging your equations so that the T.A doesn't mark you off (equation should be to the far right of the page of the equation).","The study and results section looks nice, the suggestion I would recommend is organizing your Matlab results into a table to look more professional.","Summary:Theory correctProgram looks goodcode not verifiedcomputations are completestudy is describedDepth and significance completedNew observations are done, including development of unique codescientific competence was usedReport is a pretty good read, I wrote suggestions above.","Report looks completeconclusion does connect to studypresentations style is good but needs few corrections.",Very nicely done.,everything was well organized and explained in great depth.,I really like how organized and professional your whole report looks.,You really formatted all of the information well and made it look really nice.,Your introduction and conclusion were written very nicely and describe what you are trying to prove in your report well.,You did a good job describing how you verified your code with other sources so you knew that the answers it computed were correct.,I also thought you did a good job at testing different functions in your code and showing the different results that you observed.,You explained each test and what you were trying to find very well and made it easier to understand what was happening with the different tests.,Overall I think that you have done a very nice job on your report and have a very well organized and conceivable report for anyone to be able to read.,Introduction: Very good.,"Theory: Also very goodCode Verification: Proof of verification was not shown.",Study and Results: excellent!,Code: not so well organized.,Your code is working just fine and was verified with the graphs and information that you had in the report.,You did a good job explaining how Newton's Method is used and how it needs a starting point to find the solution.,The report was organized and easy to read.,"In the technical accuracy theory part of your report, make sure to write the main equation we are going after which is x=xo-[gradient(g(xo)]^-1*g(x).","Also, if your starting point was at the center of one of the circles, it becomes singular, which means it couldn't possible have one solution.",Check and see what's your possibilities of having one solution.,"Technical accuracy - Great job your explanation of newtons method was very well thought out2.",Depth Interest - while the original problem that was solved went into some detail i think you only scratched the surface of what the program can do.,You should expand on how the program can be useful in other circumstances.,IE.,if the circles only have only one intersection point what happens to the program?,"over all good job3.",Your report was very easy to read and i thought that everything you wrote tied together well.,i think that the report needs some work in looking more professional.,maybe by making the headings bold or using a report template to make the whole report seem more appealing to the eye.,"I enjoyed reading your report and the way you explained the theory of the project gave me some ideas on how i can improve my own report thanks and good job",There are small grammatical errors throughout the report which could be cleared up with a little extra proofreading.,Possibly try to delve in to how Newton's Method can be used for applications outside of the intersection of two circles.,Also could use some more calculations to explain the equations involved with the method itself.,Create your own set of equations to be solved and analyze those as well.,"have a good start with the introduction and theory but you are missing the no solution, tangential, and the non-linear components.",Conclusion can be improved by adding the above mention pieces.,Your code works but it does not show the intersection points on the circles.,There is no report for your computing project....Refer to guidelines for computing projects on blackboard,"Technical accuracy: The report should be submitted with the m file, even though the code works.",Interest and insight: no evidence.,Quality of Report: no evidence.,As per Amie's email she sent out hrs before the due time ( I know rite?!),we were supposed to just submit the report with the .m file in the appendix.,"When I run your program the intersections are not showing up, I had to play around with the coordinates of my guess as well as the number of iterations to get this to happen for me.",Just a code that didn't do what it was supposed to.,No Report.,The only thing uploaded was the .m file.,This person did not have a report of any kind.,The code works.,"Introduction and Theory look pretty great, although the theory looks very similar to the one Amie gave us (careful of plagiarism).I would change the format of arranging your equations so that the T.A doesn't mark you off (equation should be to the far right of the page of the equation with a label such as ""equation 1"").","The study and results section looks nice, the suggestion I would recommend is labeling the tables and figures as stated in the CP instructions.","Summary:Theory correctProgram looks incomplete but pretty closecode not verified (incomplete, follow CP1 instructionsstudy is describedDepth and significance are there but not very thoroughNew observations were not done, instructions wanted also a development of your own unique codescientific competence was usedReport is a pretty good read, I wrote suggestions above.","Report looks completeconclusion does connect to studypresentations style is good but needs few corrections.",Good job!,I gave suggestions that I would have done.,Good luck!,"Technical Accuracy: Code works, however, I would adjust it so the code will produce results for both intersection points at the same time.","Interest and Insight: Did a good job of explaining the problem, and the purpose of it, including changing the radii and such.",Quality of Report: It was a good report.,"However, it is missing the code verification and also the figure and table labelings.","I would also make the ""indrodution,"" ""theory"" and the rest of the labels either a larger font or bold them, to make it look a little more professional.","Also a cover page would be a good ideaOverall, it was nicely done, a few adjustments would make it even better.","Hello,Good work and well detailed.",Some of the objectives were not answered but other than that it was good!," For technical accuracy I found your Theory, program, code verificationand computations done to be complete and correct.","For Interest and Insight you have covered the areas ""study is described, depth and significance, New Obsrevation, scientific competence"" to be complete and correct.","For Quality of the report I found it to be a good read, It is complete, the conclusion is done well, and the report is presented in a nice style.",This was an overall good report!,pretty good.,"This computing project includes all three conditions of two circles, but for the fourth part, it seems like something wrong in the figures.",1. a.,Theory appears to be correct.,He makes good use of the equations and Newton's method to explain the basis of the project.,Program is correct!,It runs.,c. Code is verified.,d. Computations have been completed.,2. a.,"Yes, the author describes in depth the study.",Relatively in depth.,Could use more insight on Newtonian's Method and how it relates to the code.,c. Nothing extravagant noticed in New Observations.,d.

answered such as using a different equation in your Matlab code.",After reading your report I feel that overall you report looks good because it is reader friendly and is well organized.,"I feel that you can expand on your intro, study and results and conclusion as they are on short side and can be expanded on more in-depth.","In the introduction section, you can tie in what Newton's Method so that you can relate back to it later in the report.","In the theory section, you give a good visualization on what equations you used.",The graph should be in the study and results section.,"In the study and results section, this is where the graph should be.","In addition to your graph, you should be displaying intersection points.","Also, you should have two other graphs, one showing an increase in radii and another showing 1 solution.","In the conclusion section, you need to go more in-depth on how it scientifically relates to the study and the class.",You can also incorporate what Newton's Method is and how it ties into this project.,"In the appendix section, I ran your code and it worked.",You need to go back and modify it to display intersection points on the graph you plotted.,You also need to go back and modify the code to create two other graphs showing an increase in radii and another showing one solution.,You're theory is well written but you could include a few more equations.,"For example, you show the Taylor series in its shortened form with just the first two terms, but you should also show the fully expanded Taylor series so people can see what it actually is.","All in all though, it gives some good insight into the problem and presents what you are doing very effectively.",I plugged your code into MATLAB and it worked without errors so your code is verified and you did a good job of performing your computations on Wolfram Alpha and the graphs were helpful.,Your Study & Results section is very informative and you do a great job of describing what each graph shows.,"You include graphs of two circles intersecting at 2 points, intersecting at one point and not intersecting at all which is exactly what the project asked you to do

startconclusion does connect to studypresentations style needs some work, but you can easily fix that.",I think you did an excellent job following the CP guidelines and thoroughly explaining the purpose of your MATLAB code.,Everything was extremely organized and coherent it made it easy for the reader to follow along.,I hardly have any negative feedback.,The use of the graphs really established your train of thought as well.,This report has the right theory for this project.,And it has organized program in order to run it.,also most of the code are correct and has error need to recode it.,This report has all the objectives.,And it need to complete in different sides of the project.,Conclusion is including all related objectives for this project.,I really like the style that when he or she started this report in ordered way,The project is well done and explained.,"However, it could have captions on the pictures.",The conclusion is the only part which could be better explained.,It should have no results on the Appendix part.,It does not present some situations which should have been analyzed.,"For example, why cannot I choose the center of the circle as my guess?",Remember to label your figures and refer to them in the report.,Format the figures in the center of the paper for a better look overall.,The theory needs to be expanded.,"Explain how you used these equations in your code, and refer to them while you do so.","Also you can delete the figures at the end of your appendix, as they are already used in the Study and Results section.",Add more to the theory section and explain how you used MATLAB to do so.,     This computing project report contains great explanation of the mean idea for doing the project in Newton's Method way.,In addition the theory is simply correct and cover the specific stuff by using equations for the explanation.,The report has very detailed writing about code verification and it is very easy to understand the progress of the report.,"However, you have to add more stuff of explanation in study and results part to get a perfect computing project report.","Technical accuracy-I liked your introduction, you did well in explaining the importance of newtons method and why we need to numerically integrate some functions.",but i think you need to add some explanation to your theory rather than just having several equations that we really don't know where they came from or how they are going to be used in solving the problem presented.,I think if you added some comments about how those equations will be used in the program you will get a lot more credit in this section.,Depth of Interest- In your original study you did a good job in explaining what newtons method does ( this is the sort of explanation you might put in the theory part of your report).,but you didn't go into very much depth in finding out what the program was capable of computing.,for example what happens if the circles don't intersect?,what does the program do?,how could you change the program to find both intersection points at the same time?,i think adding some of these questions and answers to your study and results would prove very beneficial.,Quality of the report- Over all your report was well organized.,i know this is just a rough draft so you might consider using a report template in word for your final report.,"Also naming your figures IE figure 1, figure 2, will allow you to recall figures without having to use them over and over again.",it also helps the reader match figures with what is being talked about.,The report was good; it did what it was supposed to do.,"However, I'd like to point out few things.","for instance, in the report you had data tables and figures; it will be a good habit next time to label them and identify them, because it will be easier to refer to them in your report that way.","other than that, Good Job.",Well organized.,Introduction and Theory explain the concept of Newtons's Method and its function very well.,Images throughout the report help explain the current topic of the project.,Study and Results has good use of data and charts with values in order to demonstrate the validity of the code and the proper values.,"Overall, excellent report with good use of graphs, charts and explanation.",The cover page is a great way to start off(very professional looking).,You should alter your introduction to more introduce the topic at hand rather than telling us that it will be an exercise for future projects.,"The theory section needs to explain each equation and variable used, you should edit to go more in depth about your code.",Your study and results is great at explaining what the code is actually doing.,"To make your project look esthetically better, I would fill in the many gaps that you have like the page that just has two figures and no explaining or writing.","Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computationsThe Theory section could use an example of an iteration of Newton's method.","Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the studyThere were some other questions on the project directions like moving the circles to have no intersection, and making up equations to estimate with your code.","Quality of the reportWell written and

needs more work and some edits to be in good trackthank you","at least the uploading file requires pdf format, but this one uses docx.",format.,"secondary, the tables are not displayed in the report.","Since the intersections are calculated from the code, the table must be shown up in order to give the result for different condition of circles.",We were hoping to see clearer verification of code with preferably graphs.,Also make sure to remove your name so the reviewer does not see your name on the report using the ASU posting ID.,The computing project was great.,The theory and program were correct.,The code was verified and computations were done well.,The study was described as it introduced Newton's method as well as explaining Taylor series.,The report was a good read and was complete.,The presentation style of the report was good too.,It was a well written computing project.,Technical Accuracy: Introduction is informative and your theory is correct.,The code seems to be running correctly.,It would be nice if you could get a graphical representation of what is happening.,Interest and Insight: Study is described (again graphs would help) but you do go into good depth and describe what is happening as your code is running so good job there.,Quality of Report: Report is a good read and is complete.,The conclusion connects to the study.,Remember the Graphs!,"A good report overall, missing some small points like figures and graphs.","Flawless, glad that I went through it, helped me a lot to realize things I didn't recognize before.",Your theory was very well done.,It included all of the equations needed and more.,Your introduction was also very good I could clearly understand what your project was about.,If you want to enhance your project I suggest added a little bit more to your study and results.,Create plots using Matlab to illiterate what is occurring in each different situation.,Your analysis of the numerical values created by the code was very well explained.,"The format of the report doesn't follow the outline provide in in the notes, which makes it had to grade on the requirements.","In addition, tables(above) and figures(below) should have captionsand I would work on your code so that you can provide graphical representations to go along with your tables.","Technical accuracy-I really liked how you explained the theory behind newtons method, you did a great job in explaining the purpose behind newtons method and i got some good ideas for my own report.","Depth of interest -you did well at describing the original study and you went into a lot of depth about other ways the program cold be used in different circumstances which was really good, you used a lot of figures to back up what was being tested which was also something i liked.","Quality of Report-while the technical part of your report was very good  the study and results portion was hard to follow, you have to many figures that are displaying repeated or irrelevant data which wouldn't be so bad but they also have no description as to what is happening with each new test.",i think you could go int a little more depth about what each change to the program is about and possibly give a hypothesis as to what you think is going to happen.,after that you can show what actually happened and then explain why you think it happened.,Your code is converging to the correct answer quickly which shows it is working.,I can see that you are changing things but it does not seem like you are explaining what is going on good enough.,"Your paper is mainly graphs and tables, i would take some out.",Another thing that would make your paper better is if you did not put titles for what you changed.,"for example:                                   3.5 Change the radius to make it no solutioninstead of putting a title write out what you are going to change and explain the results.",Sometimes the graphs are not enough to get the full understanding.,- Conclusion could describe how Newton's Method will apply to dynamics.,#NAME?,"- Just some errors like, ""Rearrange	Eq.","(),	it	can	be	seen	that,"" which doesn't have a number in the parenthesis.",- Possibly add more spacing so paragraphs aren't cut off to the next page.,Also spacing could make the sections less crammed.,#NAME?,#NAME?,The theory and program were done correctly.,The computations were done as well.,The description of study was done as well as it introduced Newton's method and explained Taylor series.,The report was complete and there was good organization for the exercising of of equations in the program.,The report looked good and the graphics and equations were presented well.,I feel there could of been more in depth explanations for the equations and the results.,Good Job on the report and developing the working code as well.,I saw few things i would like to point out in your code.,"For instance, in theory part, you explained the theory well, however you did not use any mathematical formulas to back up your writing.",also make sure in future reports that you include how you derive to the equations you used and show it step by step.,"Other than that, Good Job!","1. a) (points: 2) Written portion of theory looks correct, might want to show equations b) (points: 2) Code looks correct however no plot

Introduction is informative, Theory is correct but I would recommend providing newton's method equations.",Not sure if the code is verified though you have not provided the iterations.,Interest and Insight: Study could use a little bit of work seems more like code verification than an actual study.,"Quality of Report: I think this project needs a little work, it looks as if you have only  graphed 2 circles and displayed them in a plot.",There are no intersection points and no iterations done.,"Unfortunately, the file doesn't open, I get this message every time I open it: ""File does not begin with '%PDF-'"",  it may be  because it was not converted to PDF.",I wasn't able to see and download your report.,So I wasn't able to give any feedback,There was no report upload so I was unable to give any feedback,I couldn't open your pdf.,It just says failed to load pdf.,Maybe you didn't upload it as a pdf?,Sorry...,I'm sorry but for some reason I was not able to download your .pdf so I did not look over your CP.,I'm not sure why this happened.,Hopefully this didn't happen for all of the people critiquing your report.,Great Derivations.,"You had a lot of good investigations, I think you just need to write some explanation of them instead of just having the tables and graphs.",Also your report needs a decent amount of proof reading as there were some grammar errors.,This report was a very easy read.,It has all of the necessary sections with labels.,There is one typo in the first line of the introduction but other than that very good report.,This report is excellent!,I like the use of all the visuals and tables.,Easy to read and see what is going on.,Nice job referencing the appendix.,This Computing program report contains good introduction.,The theory is correct and in good explanation.,"This report has very detailed debug processing, which gives pretty confidence on the result of programing.","In addition, the author demonstrate the study result by detailed words with graphs that make the report seems very professional.",The author listed all the situation that the circle goes.,"In all, this entire report is fully structured.","Hello,A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use:-Under the Theory section, you could include the equation of a general circle, and the derivative of the general circle, as that was used in the m-file.",-You did a lot of extra discovery (i.e.,"1 interception point, and no interception points).","I would suggest doing a little more written work to show what you discovered, and why these things happen, not just the m-files.",#NAME?,#NAME?,Conclude information that you discovered through running the program (and trying different ideas).,#NAME?,Some of them seem to be different sizes.,"-I believe your conclusion should be number 5, not 4.p.s.","It was a great overall report, just minor changes could be fixed.","Great usage of figures, and tables (also you should consider naming them ""Fig.","#"" and ""Table #"")!","Minor spelling and grammatical errors, perhaps have someone proof read prior so you get your thoughts across clearly.","Overall, it followed the guidelines to the CP projects very well!",Theory is correct and the program ran as verified by the pictures and graphs taken from MATLAB.,Like said prior my suggestion is to reread through it and fix a few sentences so it flows better so the reader doesn't have to pause and piece things together.,"Hello,A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use:-Under the Theory section, you could include the equation of a general circle, and the derivative of a general circle, as that was used in the m-file.",#NAME?,#NAME?,p.s... You did a great job Correlating your Conclusion section to the Study and Results section!,You also had a very organized report!,"Good introduction, showed what is needed.",Great study and result even though the theory wasn't clarified clearly.,"In the technical accuracy theory part of your report, make sure to write the main equation we are going after which is x=xo-[gradient(g(xo)]^-1*g(x).",What happens when you choose your starting point to be the center of one of the circles?.,"You mentioned that if both circles are not connected, there's no solution.","Correct, however, what does Newton's method do about it?","Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations:The introduction part is complete and correct and the theory part is good and it's represented by Microsoft equation editor.",The program is correct and it runs.,The code is not verified and it should be verified.,The report is complete and good but it's should include graphs.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study:The study and result part is good overall but there should be graphs in this part and description of each graph.","Quality of the report:The ideas are connected and organized but it would be a better report if the student included graphs that he/she got from the code and explained each graph.","In the theory, the equations used in your report should be in this section and not just in the theory section.",Everything else looks good.,You described the study and results of the two equations you made and it all looks very good.,"For your report, you mostly completed the report.","In the Introduction you have a problem statement but you also need to include a description of the study, you should expound upon what you have already.","I do like your theory because you actually showed some of the mathematics behind the derivation of Newton's Method, but again you should explain the theory a bit more in depth in words because there is more to say for Newton's Method, take a look at the Notes on Blackboard.","You definitely have all the evidence you need in your Study and Results for the polynomials, circles, and unique nonlinear equations, but I think the addition of some images would be very beneficial to your report.","Don't forget about the ares of Depth and Significance, New Observations, and Scientific Competence.","Once you have completed your report, you need to update your conclusion.","I would also like to point out that you should have three codes for this computing project in your appendix, first is the polynomials given in the CP 1 Notes, second is the code for the two circles (which you have), and the third should be your own code with unique nonlinear equations.",Don't be afraid to explore the computing project some more!,Very detailed report.,I would suggest visuals like the picture of the graph that the code displays.,Overall a quality paper.,#NAME?,Your theory should have explanations as to why those equations are there and how you manipulated them to enter them into MATLAB.,"I see that you put a lot of this in your ""study and results"" section and I think you should consider putting more of it in the theory section.",-Great job with creating your own equations and defining them!,"-For code verification, I would maybe screen shot Wolfram's calculations and place the figure in your report and compare them to MATLAB's calculations and values (just to be thorough).","-In your conclusion, I would reference real-life examples that Newton's Method in MATLAB can be applied to.",Maybe throw out a problem an engineer would come across where Newton's Method could come in handy.,"-Lastly, I would mention the definition and importance of ""quadratic convergence"" in your study and results section.",The CP 1 pdf mentioned it and asked us to talk about it and why we set a maximum number of iterations in MATLAB.,I think you did good in this computer project.,Your introduction and theory part is really good and make me understand how the Newton's Method works.,"In the data and result part, you show us the data and figure that make us easier to know what you were doing and why you changed the data.","For the conclusion part, it made me know why we need to do this computer project and what we learned from this project.",Thanks a lot.,The intro was good but I think a lot of it could have been moved to the theory section.,Everything looked good except the figure sizes were running a little small.,No title cover.,Introduction: sentences have a good structure.,good connection between phrases.,Theory: Succinct and well explained.,Study and results: good observations and detailed results.,"missing new observations and ""playing"" more with the code.",Code verification: reliable proof that the code was working.,"Conclusion: the instructors said they would like a practical and objective conclusion, without saying ""how important"" it is and this vague commentaries.","1. a) (points:2) Theory is correct but place all the figures in the appendix because its very hard to read the report when theres a page difference between the text within the same paragraph b) (points:3) code is correct and runs great c) (points: 3) code is verified d) (points: 3) computations look correct and output is great 2. a) (points: 3) Study is relevant and correctly described b) (points: 2) could state your hypothesis within the study and results section c) (points: 3) new observations noted in report d) (points: 3) scientific background in report is stated and even used exempts of the quadratic convergence 3. a) (points:2) report is a good read, however like previously mentioned, move all figures and graphs to the appendix and reference within the paragraph b) (points: 3) report is complete and correct to my knowledge c) (points: 3) Conclusion is great d) (points: 3) very professional reportTotal Points: 33","     In this computing project report, the introduction doesn't have enough explanation about the meaning of Newton's method,so it needs just some of adding stuff to get a great explanation.","However, the theory is correct in specific explanation by using equations, but it should have not graph instead of the study and results part.",The study and results part is have the whole explanation of MATLAB results and graphs of the one and two intersection solution.,I think this project just need a little bit of editing to be a very good report detailed explanation.,    This report has good explanation of the goal for Newton Method.,Also the theory is correct and the description of study is easy to understand.,It could be better if the author provided more detailed on code verification and gave more example that shows the situation of both one solution and no solution.,"All in all, the author shows understanding of this project.","Technical AccuracyVery good insight on the theory behind the method.",No code verification was done.,"Interest and InsightThere was no depth to the problem, other than the calculated example from the notes.",There were no new observations made.,"Quality of ReportGreat body to the report.",The use of equations would be more powerful if they were neatly placed in the report and called out in the text.,Center the equations and clearly label them.,The conclusion connects to the study.,There were minor grammatical errors present.,Avoid the use of first person.,Good job.,I think your introduction and theory part is good.,"In your data and result part, you need to change your code, not put the code was given by the professor.","You need to change the h,k,r and tell us why you change these factors and what you get when you change these factors.","Also, put every figure and data in your data and result part.",Your conclusion is prefect.,Thank you.,Technical accuracy- I really liked your introduction and theory.,"you gave some good explanation as to why newtons method is a good, but i think you could show more of your actual computations in your study and results2.","Depth of interest -you went into a little detail about the original problem, however i think that you could have done a lot more in making new observations.",also your figure one doesn't show the plot of either intersection pt of the circles even though you stated right before the plot that it was the most important part of the program.,I think you should work on adding more to your study and results so that you can get the max amount of points.,Quality of Report- the report was pretty well written but for the figures in the study and results there was very little explanation as to what was going on in each figure.,"like i said write more about what the program is computing and explain what is happening in your figures you intro, theory and conclusion looked pretty good.",just need to work on the study and results,This report is very well written and organized.,All sections are complete and correct.,"However, for the study and results section I suggest the writer adds an image for the second intersection point evaluation just so the reader can better visualize the results.",No file to download...,There is not adequate evidence that shows the report was submitted.,There is no Project attached.,"1. a) there are computations provided    b) program is incorrect and should be fixed2. a) there is not description of what the CP is about or the Method being studiedb) lack of approach to testing the hypothesis or studyc) no new observations were mentioned3. report is not a good read due to the lack of effort made in writing.",there  is not study or theory explantation or description of the graphs that would.,On a good not there was an expatiation that the code was giving them problems and their results were inaccurate.,Overall report is incomplete,Introduction can be improved on by going into some detail about Newton's method.,Theory can be improved by elaborating on the process of Newton's method.,"Study and results is missing  the no solution, and the tangential components.",Also non-linear section is missing as well.,once you are able to fix these pieces and get your code working properly you will be able to clean the report up and provide more insight for the conclusion.,Code wasn't working.,Report needs more depth overall.,I'm sorry to see that your code wasn't working correctly.,"One thing I noticed right off the bat was that you din't define your ""Z"" and ""n"" variables in your while loop so I actually ended up doing that and your code ended up graphing 2 circles but then it left an error in the line ""Z = Z - A\g;"" but I wasn't sure what the problem was there.",Your theory needs to go more in depth about what Newton's method is and how it uses a Taylor series.,There are plenty of notes on the courses' blackboard page that describe how Newton's Method works and you should include a lot of that information in your report including the equations and graphs it shows.,Obviously your study and results section was lacking what it needed because your code wasn't working so make sure you get that code working and then you will need to include at least three or four graphs in that section.,"One with two intersections, one with no intersection and one with an intersection at one point.",Well I can tell you can write a well-written report but you need to put a lot more time into this one.,Your theory and study and rests sections are the two main parts of the paper and your study and results section almost entirely on your code and what you discovered from it.,"Just follow the ""CP1"" guidelines and you I'm sure you'll do just fine.",When giving the equations in the theory part of the report try to explain as to what are we using them for and what are they meant to do.,Yes those equations is our starting point but what do we do from there.,Try thinking of it like no one has ever seen this done before and your report is what they are going to go off of.,In your study and results I liked how you stated what your code wasn't able to do but try going in and explain in how you could get your code to work but stating what your code isn't able to do doesn't really show that you were able to completed the purpose of the project.,Great start tho!,"Technical AccuracyTheory seems to be sea and could be supported a little more.","The program looked correct, according to the plots, yet was not verified.",Several computations were present.,"Interest and InsightThe study was vaguely described.","The depth of the report was minimal, and there was nothing new observed.","Some test cases were examined, no intersection points and same center point.",Scientific competence could be increased through the use and explanation of the equations behind the method.,"Quality of ReportWeel written!","Very easy to read, however the report lacks equations behind the method.",The presentation style could be improved through centered equations as well as labels for the equations.,1. a.,Theory only consists of equations with little to no explanation.,Program is correct and running.,c. No code verification seen in project report.,d. Computations have been completed with tables of estimates.,2. a.,"Yes, but briefly.",More depth and a broader explanation of how and why would be suitable.,More depth of study needed.,Perhaps explain and describe the significance of the project and the code.,c. Not seen in the project.,Nothing too extravagant.,d. Scientific competence seen in reports.,"However, little explanation is given in the theory and conclusion.",3. a.,More color and sentence fluency would be nice in this report.,Yes the report is complete.,c. Yes the conclusion connects to the study.,d. Needs work and format redoing.,Your report is short and concise and really describes what it is you did very well.,The only thing I can say is you should elaborate on some parts.,"For example, you said that you entered into your code two circles with the same center and different radii and Newton's method did not work so perhaps you should include the graph it generated.","Also, go into a little more detail about how Newton's Method works.",That it uses estimations and a Taylor series to estimate nonlinear functions.,You code easily copied and pasted into MATLAB and generated two graphs and showed the iterations to find the intersection point without any error so your code is verified.,"Once again, your study and results is informative but could include a little more such as how Newton's Method works using a Taylor Series for a nonlinear function.",You are a good writer but you should put a little more time into this.,"Honestly, you wanna pack your report full of information.",Go above and beyond and really describe in-depth what it is you are doing and the equations that you are utilizing.,I really liked your report.,Everything looked like it was in the right spot and complete.,"The equations are all good, and the graphs look just like they should.",Just double check everything before the final report and you should be fine.,your report was good and good job on getting the code to work.,"few things i saw that i thing they need to be adjusted, for example you gave the data table in the theory section, which I think it was misplaced.","So, a little organization with the report will defiantly  help out :)",The quality of the report was done very well.,It was a great read.,"The report was organized as it presented all the equations, computations, and background information of Newton's method.",The interest and insights were done very well and were organized too.,It was a well written report.,"This is not even a big deal, but the font changes from times new roman to calibri half way through your theory...","There are a couple of small typos, but in general the report is very easy to read and is pretty interesting.",It might be helpful to revisit the important observations you discussed in your conclusion.,You need a title and have your name on the project.,"Great introduction, grabs the readers attention.",You may want to explain some of the variables used in the code inside the theory section.,Great study and results but combine your important discussions section with the study an results.,You need to add a code verification section somewhere in the project.,"your report hits all of the item required and from going though the report it has shown we where I can improve on mineGood job and keep it up",Very thorough and well written!,I do not have any negative feedback.,The report followed the CP guidelines closely and explained the purpose of the project extremely well.,"If anything I would try to adjust/format the spacing between some of the figures, but even this is not necessary.","Technical accuracy-While your introduction explains a little about newtons method you are missing the entire ""Theory"" part of your report.",in this part you need to discuss the theory behind newtons method and how it will apply in this situation.,"Depth of interest -you did well at explaining and discussing the initial problem given, but there is a lot more that could have been done with the study portion of your report.",for example what happens when there is no solution?,what happens if there is only one solution?,these are things that the grader is going to be looking for.,"Quality of Report-you did well at getting your ideas across and explaining what was going on in the figures you presented, just make sure as you increase the depth of your study you are backing up your study with figures and graphs.",you also might consider putting your report in a report template so it looks more professional.,good job,#NAME?,I suggest you reword it.,-Your study and results section is well written and very thorough!,#NAME?,-You should consider referencing in your conclusion a real-life problem and engineer might come across where he/she could apply Newton's method to.,"-In the CP 1 pdf, it says to talk about quadratic convergence and the importance of setting a maximum number of iterations.",You should maybe talk about this in your study and results section.,#NAME?,#NAME?,The report only contains two of the five sections that are required in the report.,"The two sections, introduction and study and results, are complete and correct.","However, he needs to include the theory section which is where any equations or concepts used with the project are placed.","Secondly, the report is missing the conclusion section which is where all the information in report is tied together.","In other words, the report should elaborate on how this project relates to dynamics.",Good report.,went in depth is writing which is good.,however there was no section for the theory which is very important for the report to include.,"also the figures and tables were not labeled, i think labeling them will help.",It could be more organized.,It could have captions on the pictures.,It could be separated for chapters.,"Also, the Theory part should have been written separated from the other ones.",The introduction is well presented.,"It is well done, but it does not explain some situations which it should explain.","For example, why cannot I choose the center of the circle as my guess?","     In this computing project report, the introduction have a good explanation about the meaning of Newton's method.","In addition, the theory is correct of the meaning, but it should have equations instead of the study and results part.","However, the study and results part is have the whole explanation of MATLAB results and graphs of the one and two intersection solution.",I think this project just need a little bit of editing to have a completely perfect report.,"Technical accuracy -all areas are covered, theory,correct program,code verification, computations.","Interest and insight- study is described, depth is significant, new observations observed, and seems to be scientificaly competentQuality of Report- The report reads good, it seems complete, the conclusions connects the study, and it is a good presentation style",Good intro and theory.,Might want to add the equations for taylor series to theory.,Definitely could use some proofreading as there are plenty of spelling and word errors.,Could expand upon your study section.,Good code verification.,I think you are missing the study about the system that you were supposed to pick out.,"Technical accuracy: The appendix contains the code, and it is verified in a specific section in the report, which is nice.",It also works and is completed and correct.,Computations are done in the code.,"Interest and insight: The introduction and study and result parts are fully described.","However, the theory part is missing the equations of Newton's method, and their derivation.",There should be more depth and details in terms of mathematics in the theory part more than wording explanations.,"The graphs are titled and introduced in the study part, which is good.","Quality of Report: Good presentation in a professional style!",The conclusion meets the goal of connecting it to the study part.,The report is completed and easy to read.,    This Computing program report contains good explanation in both the introduction and project theory.,Also the theory is correct and in specific explanation by using equations.,I think this report

and show that MATLAB can attain results for values where intersection occurs.","Report only has a single graph, in which the circles aren't even intersecting.","The intersecting points, which was one of the major objectives from the project, weren't shown then.",Good job on the introduction and Theory section.,"Study and Results section needs to be elaborated more on, adding more explanation and demonstration of the project and graphs.","Overall, a solid report that needs a little more work on adding valuable information such as graphs with intersecting circles, data charts or values

report in ordered way,Your introduction did a good job at explaining what the project was going to be about.,In order to enhance your report I suggest verifying your code by hand using known equations to find the intersections of a circle or even just a line.,Also make sure you are including all necessary equations in your theory.,"I liked how you had multiple scenarios within your study and results, it might be beneficial to add a scenario where the system of equations have more than one solution.","Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations:The

part where the student didn't do this part complete.","The ""Study and Results"" section ends with an incomplete sentence.",The document should be submitted in PDF format.,Try using graphs or other visualizations of the system of equations (such as pictures of the results MATLAB prints out) to showcase what you're talking about.,"Also, you should create your own system of equations to be solved using the code to find the solution to that set as well.","If you can, explore the different parameters that can be manipulated and explain what you see.","For example, try different starting points for the method to use or see what happens when you create two circles that don't intersect.","     First thing, that you have to upload the project in PDF format.","Secondly, this computing project is not that much good, but it explains the stuff of the project in a simple way.","Also, there are no any of equations, graphs, and verification code.",So you have to work very hard of editing and organize on this computing project report.,1. a.,Theory is correct and well written!,"Program appears to be correct by observing the code in the appendix, but without data tables and graphs it is difficult to say.",c. Code is not verified.,d. Computations appear to be done (judging by the code) but not shown in any data tables or graphs.,2. a.,"Yes, description is well put.","Yes, the theory and written portions are well written and in depth.",Significance of the project is shown.,c. No new observations noticed in report.,"d. Scientific competence made apparent in descriptions, but again, no data or estimates shown.",3. a.,Very good read!,"The report is complete with the exception of data tables, equations and mathematical concepts.",c. Conclusions connect to study!,d. Presentation style looks great!,Professional.,"first of all, where is your posting ID?","secondary, there is no discription in your study and theory part.",I think you need to reread what you have written in the introduction section.,You have a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes inside this short paragraph.,You should also read the slides online and learn a little more about how Newton's method solves these non-linear equations.,Give a little insight about how this occurs.,"All of your graphs and outputs look correct and good, but you should discuss what these graphs are telling the reader.",Under each figure you should give a little background about what the graph is outputting and how you go about receiving the graphs of the circles that you did.,You need to discuss a lot more about the study and results.,Your conclusion needs to be different than your introduction.,The first thing i noticed is that there are a few spelling and capitalization errors throughout the report that should be corrected.,Another thing i think you should work on is to describe the different things you are doing in your report better.,"For example, I would provide a brief description of what each of the equations are in the theory section and what the equations are used for instead of just stating the equation.",Also you should describe the different tests that you ran while testing your code and what you observed while doing the tests.,You did a good job at displaying the results and graphs that you received from your different tests however i would be careful about just taking the outputs directly form MATLAB and putting it in your report.,You should formulate a table in a word document or other useful programs that generate plots and copy that plot into your report.,"Finally, I would space out the lines of code in your appendix to make them easier to read and decipher.",The way that it is displayed not is very cramped and difficult to read.,"Technical Accuracy: I couldn't verify the code, the way you pasted it into the appendix, wouldn't allow me to copy it correctly.",Also there was much talked about in the way of the theory.,"Interest and Insight: To be honest, you didn't say enough about what was going on.","Need more on the theory and study/resultsQuality of Report: Needs some work.",Most of the report was just figure and tables.,Need to add more depth to it.,Talk more about what is going on.,"Also, fix you appendix so it can be copied correctly.","For some reason there are very large gaps within the report, I would try to fix these.",Also some areas where the equations occur the letters get all smashed together.,Other than that the report appears good and based on the graphs it appears that your code works as it should.,I strongly suggest following the rubric closely and clearly labeling each section in your report.,"You can refer to the  ""Guidelines for Doing Computing Projects"" folder/ tab as a great guide to make improvements that will make your report look a little more professional.",Make sure you use Microsoft's equation editor to display any equations given to us in the CP instructions.,There are a few spelling and grammar errors you can always have someone proof read the report prior to help with sentence fluency!,"Overall, good job!",It's the first CP and MATLAB projects are tough.,"Make sure to include diagrams, screenshots, graphs, and pictures of what your code ran in order to verify that it is up and running.","Hello,A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use:-I would suggest using the grading criteria, and rubric as a guide.","Include sections in your report (Introduction, Theory, Study and Results, Conclusion, and Appendix).",-Include some figures (and/or tables) to give the reader a visual of what is happening.,"-Give a brief introduction of what this report is going to detail, along with the theory behind everything (i.e.","In the Theory section, you could include the equation of a general circle, and the derivative of the general circle, as that was used in the m-file).",#NAME?,p.s.,"Everything you wrote seemed to be correct (at least to me), you just need to use some section titles, and format a little bit.","Add a few figures, and you should be set!","First off i think that you should split up sections with titles and headers, that way we can tell whats different from introduction, to study and results and so on.",This looks more like a very rough draft of your report than what should be closer to your final draft.,You introduction should not contain any equations or any methods as this should be saved for your theory.,It doesn't quite look like you have a results and study section.,To me it looks like your code does not even work properly and you just threw together a report for credit.,The main purpose of this report is to input the output of what matlab produces when you run your code.,"You should insert about three graphs, one for each part of the code you should have ran.","Even the part that you have, you definitely need to read over and correct some grammar mistakes.",You need to verify you code by going through some of your solutions and explaining how matlab goes about coming up with the output that it did.,Then you also need to explore more by creating your own nonlinear equations and inputing those into your matlab code and see what the output gives you.,Overall this is a pretty bad report and needs to completely redone.,Include the sections of the report and write the specifics in the sections.,"The sections includes an Introduction, Theory, Study and Results, and Conclusions.",Label your equations and refer to them in your report.,Refer back to for example: equation 1.a was used here.,"Save the images that MATLAB produces and put them in the correct section, study and results and label them and refer to them.",Re-read your paper and correct grammatical errors and sentence structure.,Overall you need to put some more work into this report!,Your introduction is solid and gets to the point for this project.,"In your theory, you need to describe how you came about with the equations that you have in there.",Describe the process about going through inputing the equations into matrix and what you expect these equations to produce for you by inputing them in your code.,You also need to describe the process about going through the code and generating the circles in your plots.,"With out knowing how these are produced, someone reading your report would not be able to recreate or understand about how these circles were generated.",I think you need to read through your code verification again.,Rememebr that these plots of the two intersection points are only estimates about the solution of the two intersections.,They are not completely exact as taylor series is more of an estimation process.,In your code it is important that the point is to test many solutions in order to get the correct one.,"Instead of looking at the graph and than assuming where the intersection was and using that as your initial condition, try testing a different solution and see how matlab goes about using the code and finding the correct location of the two intersections.",Excellent report throughout it all.,The introduction and Theory sections are well explained.,The Study and Results section is well above and beyond a good report.,Everything is explained in a easy-technical manner that keeps the reader up-to-date with what's going on throughout the procedure.,Conclusion is short and sweet.,Explains again what was done and how it's used.,"Great use of charts, data and graphs to further enhance the understanding of the code.","Overall, my favorite report.",Great job!,"Introduction little brief but correctTheory needs a little more reason/explanation behind it but you have a good start.",I would change the format of arranging your equations so that the T.A doesn't mark points off (equation should be to the far right of the page of the equation).,The study and results section has a nice start but CP1 instructs a lot more computations that what is shown in report.,"Summary:Theory incompleteProgram looks pretty good but needs some work to show intersections pointscode not verified computations are incomplete (I recommend following the CP1 instructions)study is described but not yet completeDepth and significance needs workcomputations are not done, don't forget to include development of unique codescientific competence not demonstrated yet.","Report is a pretty good read, I wrote suggestions above.","Report has a good startconclusion does connect to study but I would add more to itpresentations style needs some work, but you can easily fix that.",Good start!,good luck with final submission,"Technical accuracy- theory is ok, program good, code verifiaction is present, and there are computations done.","Interest and insight-study is ok, depth and insight is ok, report seems to be scientifically competent,Quality of report-The report is not a good read due to small type set and some odd spacing of paragraphs.",Seems to be a fairly competent .Conclusion is present.,"Presentation style is not good, just need to format a little better",Very nicely laid out.,Easy to follow.,Shorten up the appendix a little bit by just changing the spacing,The report is very well organized.,I would provide a little more depth in the real world application but an well written paper overall.,Also I like have the code in the original format in the appendix but I do not think it is necessary.,Your introduction looks very good.,Very thorough and correctly describes the process of taking a nonlinear equation and solving with by making it equal to 0 and using Newton's method.,In your theory describe what the g(x) form is and where it comes from.,"In your theory, also describe what the values of h1, k1 and so on are and where they come from.",After that describe what those equations produce inside the code.,"In your verification of the code, you are missing a couple of graphs.",Your first graph where you show the intersection of the two circles as well as the output numbers matlab gave you.,"However, you were also supposed to produce a graph of when there is only one solution and what matlab produces when there are no solutions with the two circles.",For the study and results part you need to describe the part where you get your initial solutions or as in the code called the initial conditions.,You did a good job on your report!,I liked stated what was going on and showed the equations and explained them.,Also liked the fact if the person reading your report had no idea how to do any of this they would be able to follow and understand.,Great job!,Great introduction to grab the readers attention.,The theory explains the equations used in the matlab code very well.,Code verification is very direct and straight forward.,May want to go more in depth in your study and results.,Awesome real world example!,The file appears to be missing on this report.,There is no .pdf file included.,"It states ""The file is missing.""",No file provided,There is no project here for me to evaluate.,File is missingŠ—_.,"After reading over your report, overall it looks great.",There are a few elements in which you are missing (conclusion) section.,The report is well organized and is reader friendly.,"In the introduction section, you give a good insight to what Newton's Method is and how we are using it in MATLAB which is great.","In the theory section, you need to show calculations and derive your equations.",This section seemed a little short so you can expand on this here.,"In the study and results section, you give good step by step examples on what you did which makes this section look very professional.","I would go back and put captions to all of your graphs stating what is going on or at least label them ""Figure 1""...You lack a conclusion section.",In this section your can tie in everything that you have done and how it relates to the class and how it can scientifically be applied to engineering.,"In the Appendix section, I ran your code and it worked.","Overall, good job on the report and go back and modify what I have stated above so you don't miss out on points.","I suggest actually adding some of the equations and the concepts already presented to us under your ""Theory"" section.","Even if most of the equations were already derived, copy and paste them into your report because if the reader had no previous knowledge as to what the computing project had to be about there would be a bit of confusion.",Your study and results section could also use better sentence fluency to get your points across.,I also suggest adding a conclusion to your report just to sum up your ideas even if it sounds repetitive!,Excellent Read.,I would prefer to see the equations provided by the notes in the theory section and how you implemented those equations into MATLAB.,Remember to label your figures in the report and refer back to them.,For example: looking at figure 1.a Circles solution to the right we can see...Add in the conclusions section to your report and summarize it briefly.,"Overall excellent read, just add in the conclusion section and label those figures.","Even though the equations are given in the CP prompt, it would be helpful to discuss them in your theory.",Explain why it is important to implement them into your code and how it affects your study.,Missing a conclusion.,Make sure to revisit any new observations you discovered and discuss here.,Need to clarify the derivation in the theory's part.,"For your report, you only partially completed the report.","For the Introduction, your information is recited directly from Computing Project 1 Notes.",The Introduction needs to have both a problem statement and a description of the study.,"I do like your theory because you actually showed the derivation of Newton's Method, but you should also explain the theory in words as well because there is more to say.","You have some evidence in your Study and Results, but try to explain all the things your code accomplished a bit more.",I think including the images showing your results is very useful.,"Also, you should consider removing the lines of code after your unique nonlinear function, it is very distracting.","Once you have completed your report, you need to update your conclusion.","I would also like to point out that you should have three codes for this computing project in your appendix; the first is the polynomials given in the CP 1 Notes, second is the code for the two circles, and the third should be your own code with unique nonlinear equations.",Don't be afraid to explore the computing project!,"After reading over your report, overall I feel that it is well organized and is reader friendly.","In the introduction section of the report, you give good insight to what Newton's Method is and how it is applied.",This is great because you will be able to tie in what you talked about in this section into the conclusion.,"In the theory section, it seems unfinished.",You are right that you have to show the derivations of the your equations but  you need to elaborate on what all that is.,"To the reader, I do not know what all that means.",You need to state how it relates to Newton's Method.,"In the study and results section, this is were you explain how you came across your graphs and what each graph means.","In addition, you should show a caption under each graph  such as ""Figure 1""...which will make your report more organized.","Also, I am not really sure what the ""Warnings"" are on page 3-4.",I have not seen this in the other 4 reports I am critiquing.,"In the conclusion section, I feel you can tie in what you stated in the intro and theory.","Also, you can incorporate how it is applied to this class and scientifically applied to engineering.","in the appendix, I ran your code and it worked.","Overall this report looks good, just modify the report as I have stated above.",introduction gives a clear explanation of what CP is about.,Theory could go more into detail about what is going on with the equations how they relate to Newton's method.,Study and results: place solutions given from code into a table to keep things organized.,explanation of graphs and what equations went with them would improve report.,"there needs to be an area of new observations ( like if the equations were changed in the code to see what happens to the graphs) the report is incomplete.",go into more detail with theory and study and results.,"Presentation: organize and clean up solutions  work on conclusion",- I'm not sure if the results with the constant error message could be presented in a better looking way.,#NAME?,"- Images need figure/table captions- Make sure everything is spaced-well so things aren't cut off, like how the Study and Results title is by itself.",#NAME?,I didn't recognize the song until after reading the description.,"I like how it works the design looks kind of simple but it really isn't because of all the cords and things, which is a good thing.","it's kind of slow doesn't really make me feel anything but like you said, it works and thats what matters right now","The look of the patch is quite complex, but when you look to where each path goes it starts to make more sense.","The visual of three keyboards gives you a nice visual to what is being played, and the labels to each path and keyboard helps a lot.",The technical aspect of it is very easy since all you have to do is click on the toggle and the song starts.,"The small made me smile a bit since it was ""Don't Go Breakin' My Heart"" and it's pretty close to the actual thing.",I think what can be done better is having it more clean since tracing each path was a little tough to figure out at times to see what was hooked up to what.,"Other than that, the concept of the patch was pretty neat and quite clever.","When I first opened the patch, its overall appearance was nice and clean.",The patch was visually appealing with the three keyboards being visible.,"On a technical note, everything worked smoothly and continued to get better as I plated with the patch more The creator of this patch really took a lot of time and effort to get the song just right.",I thought the patch was very advanced and creative.,It certainly evoked some dance moves.,It looks like it is all over the place but once you take a closer look at it its not that bad.,There are 3 different pianos and i believe each one has its own little section to perform.,I've never heard the song before so i have no idea if it is accurate or not.,It was still well done.,I wouldn't say this was a simple sequencer.,But I would say it was extremely effective in isolating how to achieve different beat qualities; i.e.,"1/8, 1/4, & 1/2 notes.","This was something I started to mess with, but did not have time to do it for the whole song.",so I omitted it and make mine simple full notes.,"I like that he took time to isolate how to create different beat qualities, something I had trouble with.","The patch was fairly simple, but it worked.",And he also got rests in the patch.,Good song choice.,"The patch was simple to understand, and very nice and tidy.","Only thing I could really suggest is if you wanted to go the extra mile, you couldve added bass notes to it.",The sequencer plays the intro to the song Take on Me.,The patch works by first using a toggle switch that begins the sequencer at a metro of 170.,There is also an option that allows you to change the tempo.,The metro then runs into a counter of 32 and then selects notes.,The patch was overall very clean and worked very nicely.,Sequencer sounded just like the song.,The only thing missing was comments.,The overall patch looked very straight forward.,"It looked very neat and organized, so that made it look really nice.",working are fairly straightforward.,The creator used the stuff we were shown in class and put them to good use.,I particularly enjoyed the song that definitely made me feel good.,"The only suggestions I can make are that some objects in the patch were left for me to figure out, so comments may have been helpful.","Also, some adjustable numbers would maybe work better is they were set in bounds.",That way it eliminates the possibility of breaking the song.,"Other than that, I thought it was a wonderful patch.","This patch looks very basic, following the same layout as the example that was shown in class.","With that said, it's well organized and is very simple to make work.",On top of that I like the addition of the midi keyboard to visually see what notes are being played.,"This patch works by clicking on the toggle object, which then goes through the counter and then goes on to select the commanded notes, all while giving a visual display on the keyboard.","The metro serves as the metronome in this patch, keeping everything on a steady rhythm.",Well you can't be human and dislike this melody...,"Seriously just hearing this classic tune through the ""bleep"" sounds made me happy.",Very simple and to the point!,"Perhaps an improvement to this would have been to add the bass section, so instead of just the lead melody it will sound more like a full band.","This is a pretty cool little patch, and you did a good job recreating the melody.","I might try adding in chords to add interest, but good job overall.","Based off of the description that was written for this project, it was very clear for me to determine what the goal was.","Due to how simple the goal was put, there was no possible way for me to misunderstand what the author was trying to accomplish.",The way that the patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the toggle.,The toggle then activates the two buttons and two metro objects which then activate the counters on each side.,"The counters are attached to two different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1 to 8 and 1 to 6, with 8 and 6 buttons on each side.","These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a message attached to each input and a combination of a kslider, a makenote object, and a noteout object.","In case the notes are stuck, there is a flush message attached to each kslider in order to wipe the messages clean for the notes to start over.",The author created a simple song with the use of 2 different set of notes.,"Their sequencer branched out into two different sides, one representing the left hand, the other representing the right hand.","The left hand had chords, or played many notes at one time, while the right hand played single notes.","After going over this patch, I thought that it was well made.",The layout is very clear to understand and is very efficient at achieving its goal.,I hardly see any fault with it.,My only concrete suggestion is to possibly avoid having duplicate numbers in the chord messages.,"The author made a very nice, simple max patch.",The song isn't recognizable to me (not that that's imperative).,"Very interesting that the author decided to use a different, yet proportionate time scale between the two sequencers.","It reminds me of an old fashioned, mechanical sequencer.","A cool way to improve this would be to 1.","Add a presentation mode2.",Add a way for the user to change time count and pitch value.,Very good sequencer.,I like how you did to pianos at the same time.,"The patch was very easy to understand, especially since you labeled it.",Had a very happy sound to it.,I can't really think of anything that might need fixing.,"Though the song does sound off at some points, but it's probably supposed to sound like that.",This patch had a very interesting sound and I liked it.,The dissonance sounds very cool and it made me feel a little bit creeped out.,The layout is easy to follow and very visual with the slide out keyboard.,Having the buttons light up makes it easy to follow where the music is and the notes in number form.,The comment boxes help guide what is going on as the user looks through the patch.,"The patch works via the kslider and the notes shown in the message box, with chords clearly listed in number form of the keys.","I would say there is a melody and a harmony, playing at the same time but to a different metronome.","I read that it is not really a song, but it is not bad to listen to, I think the last couple notes in the harmony sound a little off but it still works.",Truly fantastic.,I like that the author decided to go with a graphic sequencer.,I'm not exactly sure how the author made this as I am an amateur Max user.,The author seems to have programmed a sort of coordinate system which is really impressive to me.,It was nice to visualize exactly what would play.,The only thing I would ask for is the author to include a presentation mode and a sort of highlighter that went along with the beat on the graphic.,The work looks like some sort of sequencer based upon dots on a grid.,"As you change which dots on the grid are active, the sequence of notes and combination of notes changes.","Lastly, changing the metro changes the speed, higher metro is a lower repetition rate of the notes.","After the sequence, there is a code sequence that reads the number output on the grid and changes those numbers into the sounds we hear.","there is an additional patch that the author created, but I do not understand its purpose completely, it may control the grid.","I think it is very conceptually pleasing, allowing for a high amount of interaction between the user and the art, although the sounds may not be the most joyous to hear.","I would suggest different note structures playing different songs to visualize the song coming together, perhaps each column being a different chord and each row a different instrument, similar to logic.",It looks very flashy and nice.,Although it looks pretty complex once you read the instructions it becomes easier to use.,I like how there is a clear button for the program as well.,It looks like a very cool patch.,I like the interaction with the different tempos and different variations of responses.,I guess the only thing would be that I did not understand the musical aspect.,This sequencer was well made and easy to understand for the most part.,"Intersections within the constructed matrix are played when the user selects them, which produces the notes.",The sequencer has a 8-beat metronome in which the notes are paced..,The sequencer can be altered for looping and changing of speed for note playing.,"The sequencer was creatively thought out, but I would suggest that the design were made slightly simpler for others in the class to understand.","For most, the class is an introductory course and we have yet to cover matrix objects in the classroom.",But excellent work above all else!,It was very simple to understand due to labeling.,"The sound was very annoying after a while, but I was impressed by how you changed to BPM at some points.",The thing that I would suggest is to try and make it sound more like a song instead of just random sounds.,This work is pretty simple but it's intricate and makes the beeps change tempo after a while.,"Everything works fine technically, the buttons all go to one or another number value.","It made me feel very calm, it wasn't anything too crazy or too simple, just a simple project.",There is nothing I think you could improve on with this project.,"This patch is appears to be simple, but it is very organized.","At first glance, I was a little confused where there were two metro and ""make a bleep"" objects/sub-patches, but after a little testing I realized that they did actually change the song in a tangible manner, both adding beats and changing the tempo.","The patch works by simply clicking the starter button, and a counter and select object feed key numbers to the make a bleep patch at continuous intervals, creating a simple 8-10 note tune.",The song was pleasurable to listen to.,It had a nice melody and the notes meshed together nicely.,"A suggestion to improve the work would be to include some notes that tells the viewer, and the author itself, what parts do what.",It would have been nice to see that as I think the whole critiquing process is a potential learning experience for the critics.,The description of the patch is pretty spot on.,I enjoyed the fact that this person decided to use two different metros to alter the tempo throughout the course of the 8 notes.,This gives it a little something extra and shows that he/she tried to take it a step further than the bare minimum that was required.,"The composition itself is not exceptionally pleasing to the ears because of the constantly changing notes and tempos, but all in all the patch was clear, straight-forward, and well organized.","The only thing that I maybe would have done differently is created a composition that appeals to the ear more by means of a good solid melody, but that's just me.",This Particular Patch looks very impressive.,It is well laid out and organized and by looks I'd give it an A.,The sound was very good and super fun.,"I was very happy with the sound itself and though the buttons and colors would have been cool, I think it was well done.",But this has much potential so yes  i would decorate it up more.,"The patch is very well organized, the buttons conveying the bang command arranged in a zig-zag manner that keep the blinking going through a continuous motion.","The two sequencers are situated side by side in a branching fashion, with the number messages' connections all going into the number box to produce the notes.",A single toggle and metronome command control both.,"Technically, the patch works fine.",When the toggle is flipped on the sequence runs through its notes and repeats itself.,"The submitter crafted a simple melody that is pleasant to listen to, even on repeat.","The one suggestion I might put forth is that they should work to increase the length of the melody, add a different progression.",The patch is very clean and looks really good.,It's nice just watching the little lights go up and down while it plays.,"Sounds nice to, I can tell what song it is and its soothing, like a lullaby.",The sequencer has two sets to play each part and they work well together.,Only thing missing is comments.,"The work consists of notes being payed while buttons are pressed, both maxpatch buttons and piano keys, to illustrate which note the song is playing currently.",I am guessing from the title the song is Somebody but i admittedly do not recognize it.,"A toggle initializes the metronome, sending bangs, through a counter, which runs a select and plays different notes of the song.",An additional patch runs the physical notes via the midi piano.,I enjoyed this patch because it plays something fun that was easy to listen to and was clear what the author was trying to accomplish.,"In the future, I would suggest adding an element that would make the experience more interactive, like buttons that would light up on the keys so that the user could play the song rather than the computer.",Toggle turns on metronome that splits into two separate 24 channels sequencers.,The two pianos are hooked back into one speaker with track being activated by toggle switch.,Easy to use and clear presentations is effective and understandable.,Basic looped track.,"Straight forward piano song with two parts, bang buttons and notes are arranged in a pattern that is visually appealing.",Not the most interesting song but well done considering the effort to create it.,Next time maybe choose a song that is more catchy?,Patch was clean and very simple.,It was pretty much bare minimum and I would've liked to hear a little more of the song but the part that did play was recognizable and didn't hit any snags.,"Also, would've like some comments.",The patch is pretty simple and very easy to understand.,The layout is good and flows from top to bottom.,The jingle bell song was very recognizable and easy to hear.,It reminded me of the upcoming holiday.,inserting some pauses and longer notes in some spots could really make the flow of the song better.,"The patch looks ordinary, but does what it is supposed to do.",It plays the first part of the song Jingle Bells.,"The presentation could have been better, maybe using a sub patch to hide all of the wiring and adding a panel or buttons, but maybe the creator doesn't know how to do those things.",Other than that it is a very well made patch.,I like how simple/clean the patch is.,"I thought it would play a little more of the song so It kind of felt incomplete, not in a bad way, more like I just wanted to hear more.",(i know we weren't required to do complete songs),"The patch is a simple, 16-step sequencer programmed to play part of the ""Jingle Bells"" tune.","It works exactly how the example patch we created in class works, with a toggle object operating a metronome object which, through a counter object, sends several different values into ""make a bleep"" and consequently the audio output.","Conceptually, the patch is very simple, and seemingly designed only to display the skills we learned in class, although it is a basically pleasant tune with an innocent connotation.",The inclusion of more bars of the song as well as the use of polyphony to create harmony might have made this patch more interesting.,The patch looks pretty intense but I can understand everything that's going on.,It looks like they combined last week's assignment with this week's which is really neat.,A metronome sets off a 3 different sequencers in order.,"First the metronome sets off the sequencer for buttons that are linked to sound files that have drums, then bass, then synth.",I'm not really sure how the restart and stop buttons work to be honest but they're pretty cool!,I liked this a lot because of how the user could interact with it.,I think that was a fun element that was added to the project and I had a lot of fun making my own song with the beats.,The only suggestions I really have are to maybe make everything a little easier to read.,"It's a little cluttered, although with so many elements I'm not really sure if there is a way to make it clearer.","Also, I noticed the bass could only be heard in the left speaker, I'm not sure if that was an aesthetic choice or not but I would suggest putting them in both speakers.","The work is a three-part sequencer designed to play a complex instrumental with drums and synth, and it includes a manual element.","It works by using the metronome/counter to send signal to ""sfplay~"" objects and the ""make_a_bleep"" subpatch, the latter of which is triggered using the process we used for the ""good key bad key"" project.","The author created a customizable instrumental loop, which is similar to what I tried to do, although this is a more creative and fun application.","The only suggestion I have is a little ambiguous thanks to my limited knowledge of Max, but I think there might be some procedural way to counteract the awkward latency time that interrupts the even progression of the metronome.",I really like the overall concept of this patch.,"The patch creates a synthesized beat using Drums, Synth and Bass.",It also allows the user to have a solo part and interact with the beat.,It looks like a complicated design to program but it is very easy to operate especially with the comments telling me what to press and what everything is.,I really enjoyed how this project let me interact with it although It doesn't sound very good when I interact with it.,"Maybe next time, instead of allowing the user to solo on a piano you should allow them to add and remove beats by pressing different keys.","At first, I was blown away with how many sounds there were in the folder.","And once I opened the patch, it looked very intricate and complicated.","Although there were some tempo/sound issues, it was a well completed song.",Initially I opened it and instantly noticed how complicated the patch looked.,It looked very interesting.,"To use the patch, all you have to do is turn on the ezdacs, then turn on the toggle at the top.","Once I started using it, I started to have a lot of fun with the sequenced tones and the added feature of being able to play your own tones along with the sequenced tones.",The only suggestion I can think of is making it a little bit more organized and easier to use.,I feel as if many of the ezdacs could have been combined to make the user only have to click one.,"Other than that, it was beautifully made and I enjoyed it a lot.","Somehow, I could not get it to work on my machine.",The audio and videos would not play.,I looked at the folder and the patch seems really cool.,The user interface in presentation mode looks great.,"Outside of presentation mode, I think that the plan is to have the sequencer open a series of videos and sounds.",The work is set to run only in presentation mode.,"At first glance, before in presentation mode you can see that it appears somewhat complex.",More went into this than was requested by the assignment.,It's difficult for me to understand exactly how this works but I can tell that sounds are activated which then activate different video files that stack upon one another to produce a full image.,I really like what it produced but I would change the sample files to be more relative and flowing to the visual piece.,The sounds aren't something I would personally want to hear repeatedly for very long.,Oh my god!,Sooo cool!,I'm not really sure if it was a sequencer thing but it was cool!!,"Now that I look at it closer, it does have a sequencer implemented into it however, most of it is primarily visual and video.","The start button works as well as the random button, though it was kinda confusing why there were two buttons.","The visual presentation was outstanding, however the musical part was not really a recognizable song, it was just a bunch of beats and rhythmic drums.","However, the music suited the visual.",It almost made me feel like I was creating the music as I move my cursor around.,The work might be improved by creating a song element to the presentation.,Maybe have different sounds associate with different videos.,Really cool visuals!,"First off, I could not get to presentation mode without opening it through MAX, not MAX Runtime, and the window was huge, I could not minimize the bottom to see the buttons so I just clicked around until I got it (but those are minor details).","Once in presentation mode and pressing the start button, I was fascinated to see the face and wings and more faces pop up to different sounds.","I was interested in seeing how the coding was done, since it is so much more advanced than the simple make a bleep, so I unlocked the patch and...wow.",Now I see why it took so long to download.,The sounds are looped based on the part of the totem pole (I guess is what it is?),and a video plays a small animation that correlates to the sound.,"There was the option to start from the top down, or to go in a random order where the sound would play and the corresponding video animation along with it.",I found it to be an awesome interactive animation that I could see be on a website and a user would just scroll over a part and the sound would play and the specific part would animate.,"I don't know what else to say about improving it, I think it is well made.",I can tell that you spent a lot of time on this patch and it looks great.,But I just couldn't figure out how to get it working.,I got everything to show up except the videos.,Maybe its because I'm using a PC?,"When first opening the patch, it shows one button attached to three sub-patches.",I really enjoy the simplistic look.,"As for technical analysis, I did in fact have to go into one of the sub patches and turn on the audio which was kind of a hassle considering that I didn't know how to do that at first.",The song itself is simple and feels familiar even though its a song I had never heard before.,The different note length really added to the overall effect of this.,My suggestion would be to solidify the audio issue.,Maybe having an audio button right above the initiating button just for the purpose of turning on the audio would help.,"Description:""Untitled 2040"" presents itself like a music box: a small, simple exterior concealing its complex and illusive inner workings.","There is only one instruction, ""JUST PRESS THE BUTTON!!!",""", and after doing so the viewer is presented with a simple and soft yet haunting melody.","Technical Analysis:On the top level, a button is pressed sending a bang to three sub-patches ""short notes"", ""long notes"" and ""longgggg note"".",Each sub patch receives the bang to toggle the metronome and then begin a timed sequence through 53 steps.,"If a note is to be played, than the ""select"" function leads to a note number, which is sent to the ""make a bleep"" sub patch.","There are 3 note lengths, 500, 1000 and 2000 ms. After the sequencer has completed, if there are no more inputs from the user, it loops.","Conceptual analysis:I used the term ""illusive"" intentionally.",At the beginning you are only presented with a really simple interface that betrays just enough of its inner workings to entice the user into imagining the clockwork structures that lie beneath the surface.,"But, if you try to pinpoint the exact location of the music, instead you get to see only hints of notes, disjointed between 3 sub patches.","Breaking apart the work even further using the ""make a bleep"" patches contributes to it's overall ghostly feel.","In the end, hearing the simple sine wave generators teases a person who tries to pick it apart.",It's deceptively simple- yet it's hard to picture in the minds eye just how each cog in the machine rotates.,"Improvement:If and only if the author is going for true simplicity would I suggest that this could be arranged differently.","Sure, the author could combine each of the sub patches into one patch with only one metro and one select that lead to three sine wave generators- and doing so might make it easier for the user to know what's going on in the patch.",But it would also ruin the experience a bit.,"Here, the illusion of simplicity adds to it an ethereal quality that would be lost if actual simplicity was achieved.","Only after digging through all of the sub patches does the user understand the true meaning of the piece, and it's only instruction- like a pointillism, scrutinizing and dissecting this piece doesn't lead the viewer to more meaning, to view it you ""JUST PRESS THE BUTTON!!!","The project first opens up a small window with a button connected to 3 different sequencers (short, long, and longgggg) which play at the same time to produce the melody connected to the make_a_bleep patch.",There are clear comments about the sequences and what she intended with the blank spaces.,"To make it easier to navigate there are four windows (the play button connecting the sequences, short, long and longgggg notes).",She used an inlet to connect.,"It was a little redundant that she put in a button between the metro and counter, when she could just connect the metro directly to the counter.","It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when she could direct connect them, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.",I was confused at first seeing only the initial small window open.,It did not play when I pressed the button.,"Only until I figured out to click the messages and turned on the sound in the sequencers, did it start playing.",(Sorry for reading your comments last.,Oops.),I had first played each of the sequencers by itself and then realized they were suppose to be played at the same time.,It is very cute and pleasing to listen to.,I really like the melody.,"At first glance, the patch looks very simple, and it plays a nice melody.","Things are packaged nicely into subpatches, according to note duration.","The main patcher window has one button which, when pressed, toggles the subpatches to create the melody.",The concept was very nice and enjoyable.,"Being standard MIDI notes, it does begin to grate on your ears after a few times through.","Right offhand, I can't think of anything that would have made it better.","There is nothing interesting about the patch itself, but I was excited to hear the song since I am familiar with ""Funky Town"".","But honestly, even though I had the songs melody in my head before I played the patch, I had trouble recognizing it when the patch played.",There are pauses in the actual song that were not in the patch.,It would have been much more recognizable if the pauses had been incorporated.,The patch worked flawlessly.,Adding the pauses would be the only thing I'd suggest.,This sequencer was easy to understand and very enjoyable to listen to.,"The sequencer is activated through the button objects, which played the tune of funky town.","The design of the sequencer was familiar, yet still held original characteristics in functionality.","I would suggest to add more background notes by adding another sequencer branch for the music to feel more ""whole"" in composition.","One toggle, one metronome, one counter, ten buttons, ten notes, a beep and a speaker.",Works well and fulfills the basic requirements of this project.,Also uses well known tune that is easily recognizable.,"This is truly a basic sequencer in the utmost sense of the word, this concept could really have used additional development.","Either a longer loop, additional parts, graphics or even a volume control could have added additional dimensions that would have taken this piece to the next level.",Slightly disappointed that there was not more to it.,Maybe this person is struggling with the program or musical composition is not their thing.,Hope to see something a little more developed in the future.,This patch meets all the expectations for the assignment.,"The organization is clear, although there is no commenting.","It runs exactly as the in-class demo did: toggle, to metronome, to counter set with 1 and 10 as parameters, to the selector with the parameters identified explicitly, to the numerical values assigned each numeric parameter, to a number box reporting which line of the parameters is active, to the sound generator subpatch, and finally to the speaker.","As far as feel, it was sort of lackluster.",It was the minimum required for the assignment and nothing more.,"This is nitpicky, but I would have sped up the metronome tempo to match the song.","Initially the patch looks great, it looks like it is a pretty simple concept but still has a very cool technical look to it.",It also worked perfectly upon trying it out.,It was neat and the jingle it played was pretty cool.,The only thing that you could have done that might have been cool is throw in the synthesizer keyboard for added visual effect.,"I really like this layout, it's nicely organized into four different sections.","The midi track, and then three ""make a bleep"" sounds running under their own separate counters.","This patch works by turning it on with the toggle, which triggers the wav file that contains the drum beat, and the three bleep pieces that offer melody to the beat.","I think it's awesome that you went beyond having a patch that only contains ""bleeps,"" and actually incorporated a bet into it.","This made the whole thing feel much more authentic, and just overall more musical.",It kind of sounded like old video game midi sounds with a drum beat under it!,"I'm not totally sure if the wav file is perfectly in time with the bleep sounds, but it doesn't sound too off.","By toggling the button, the patch begins an avant-garde sounding song with a percussion track.","Each select option connected to several different keys, which made the whole thing sound spacey and cleverly ambient.",There was also a wav file that played along with the rest of them.,I really enjoyed the cool song that it played.,"That being said, I'm not sure it sounds exactly how the author intended.","One select option had 5 beats, which contrasted with the 8 beat selector on one and the 7 beat selector on the other.","If intentional, it was a cool effect!",I would suggest possibly stating on the description the kind of sound you wanted to portray instead of just saying it may not work (confidence is key)!,"Also, the drum track continued playing even after toggling it off.","Overall though, it worked very well!","I felt like it could have been the background music for an old nintendo game, I liked that.",I would have cleaned up/organized the patch a little more but overall it was good.,"The patch was well organized, I could tell what was going on.",It works perfectly fine.,"It didn't really make me feel anything, it just made me think of aliens.",I would improve this patch by adding one more note to each sound.,It sounds like it's one note too short.,Opens a window with a large toggle button that triggers three sequences and a wav rhythm to go along it.,(There is a random button floating in the third sequence.,Haha.),It goes to the make_a_bleep patch to play.,"It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter.","It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.",The open SongforMaxPatch.wav is opened twice in the sequence by the big toggle and the first sequence pattern (redundant).,"It seems to just be a random rhythm sequence, but it's fun and interesting to listen to.",I was initially confused when I stopped it from playing and I still heard a rhythm.,"The wav file could have been shorter, so when the toggle is off, the music will stop more immediately.",Well done in completing the assignment requirements.,"You've definitely nailed the objective of the challenge in understanding how to use objects like metro in combination with messages, bangs, and select in combination to emulate the Harry Potter theme.","Perhaps it is because of the instrument used or some slightly irregular timing, but it's a little difficult to discern that this is the Harry Potter theme.",How did you transcribe the midi notes - using the sheet music like we discussed in class?,For the scope of the class assignment this project was done well and the patch was relatively orderly.,"It did not take me long to figure out how the patch worked and how to operate that, but this is coming from someone with some prior max experience.",It may help in the future to label your toggle at the very least so we know how to activate the music right off the bat instead of searching for the start mechanism.,I love Harry Potter so kudos to the effort!,I wonder how you decided to address your challenges in your own words in order to get to the desired solution.,"When you first open it its a bit over whelming, all the cords and things.",I don't watch harry potter much so it kind of just sounded like random sounds towards the end it almost sounded like it came from an old horror movie.,but it works well and thats what counts,Right off the bat I really love how everything is laid out.,"With so many notes everything can easily get very cluttered, but this makes it really easy to understand.",The patch works by having a metronome set off a 37 numbered sequencer.,The sequencer then sets off different notes.,For chords the sequencer sets off multiple notes at once.,I loved the Harry Potter theme song!!!,Great song choice.,That made me really happy and I think they did an amazing song dealing with all the different types of notes and chords involved.,I don't really think there's much they should do to improve it.,The patch itself is very clean and the song is recognizable; I think they met all the requirements.,The patch looks really complicated because of so many connections everywhere.,"However, after closer examination, it was a relatively simple patch that incorporated all the techniques that we learned in class.","The patch worked fine, it played the tune it was supposed to and it actually sounded like the Harry Potter theme.","The sound was nice however, it did seem a bit choppy at times.",The notes seemed a little disjointed but it still worked fine.,"Maybe, if the notes flowed together more it would sound like the real song from the movie.",It sounded more like a computer made it than an actual instrument.,It was still good though!,The patch itself looks very complex due to the song being long and has many keys.,That being said I really enjoy the this patch.,It looks like you put a lot of effort into this and I like how keys are similar to the actual Harry Potter theme song.,Harry Potter is so iconic world wide that anyone who knows Harry Potter will recognize this song.,"You might want to clean up the patch a bit but overall it is a cool patch, I would like to create something like this myself.",Great job!,Very simple patch that works.,"Opens up a simple sequence and has the user presses the toggle to play ""Mary Had a Little Lamb.""",Connects to p make_a_bleep.,"It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter.","It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.","It was interesting that the sequence connects several of the select bang points to single points (each time to sequence/melody hits F#, the point is connected to a single 66).","While this isn't as easy to see the rests or the individual points when the melody hits F#, it makes it more condensed.","Description:This patch plays the tune ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"".","Technical Analysis: When a bang is received, it begins a metro counting every 500 ms.",The counter then cycles through all 32 steps in the sequence.,"If a note is to be played, the select function sends a bang to a message containing the note value to the ""make a bleep"" patch which produces the sine wave.","Conceptual Analysis:""Untitled 2055"" is successful in meeting all of the requirements of the assignment.",The tune it produces is recognizable and everything works as described.,It is the ultimate expression of utility and adequacy.,"Suggestion:The only thing that I would suggest is getting rid of the number that's connected to the metro object.","The number selects the time in-between each count by the metro, but the metro object already has ""500"" as the time.","So, unless the author wanted the user to change the tempo of the piece, the number can be removed.",You did it!,"The patch works, it's neat, and it's obviously Mary Had a Little Lamb.",By all accounts you've completed the assignment parameters nicely.,If you were to go above and beyond I wonder what you may have challenged yourself to do.,I would also add a comment to the toggle box out of curtesy to let a new user of your patch know more directly how to activate it.,"Overall, well done in completing the assignment.",Now to see where your creativity comes in when given more time or a more interesting project...,Your sequencer was clean and seemed to worked well.,I feel like your sequencer worked well considering the level of work it took to make it.,I feel like you made successful easy sequencer (nothing wrong with that) that worked correctly.,One suggestion would be to go a little out of the box considering this was one of the examples he showed.,"But overall, good work.","This one was a little bit confusing to me because I couldn't hear what part of Smells Like Teen Spirit this was from, but you did a good job and used a lot of notes.",Also the instructions were very clear.,"Upon opening the patch, there was a pleasant setup to the patch layout.",Little text boxes helped guide the user through which buttons do what.,When I clicked the main button.,"I was only able to hear about two of the bleeps, but I know there were more because of how many buttons and channels there were, so I assume there was a minor issue with the patches functionality.","All in all, this patch does what it's intended to do and has a clean and aesthetic look to it.","I think your layout is very interesting, I also really appreciate the fact you have multiple things going on at the same time.",The only issue I had was actually getting the melody to play!,"Good stuff though, me not being able to make it play was either an error on my part or could probably be remedied with a little troubleshooting.",Excellent job!,"Your patch is fairly clean looking, and you were successful in doing what you tried to do.",Using the select on the 64th count to trigger the next part was clever and I have learned by looking at how you designed your your patch.,The one thing that you could do to improve your patch is to add your own colors to personalize it that much more.,The patch plays two different parts of Nirvana's teen spirit using two different sequencers.,"Although it isn't the neatest looking patch, it seems functional and accomplishes the goal fairly well.",The most impressive technical part is the use of counters in switching back and forth between the two different parts.,I felt intrigued by the technicality though couldn't relate with the musical choice but enjoyed it nonetheless.,I think this could be improved by organizing everything a little more and also fixing the overlap between the two sections.,I feel like you completed a basic sequencer.,"You used random keys just to create the ""song"".",It is very clean and looks pleasing.,I feel like you could have went a little out of the box and actually tried to recreate or make a real song but this was cool too.,One suggestion would be to try to explore a little more than just the basic sequencer.,"After listening to your patch, I can say that you definitely achieved your goal making an aggressive irritating noise.","But after a while of listening to it, it started to become like a trance and the notes made sense.",It was a unique blend of different keys that made this patch enjoyable to listen to.,The layout of the patch was clean and worked like it was supposed to.,Good job.,This patch loks like another take on playing the piano via a metronome such as was taught in class.,What makes this interesting and technically different is the addition of the saw~ tool which antialiases the music giving it a darker electronic feel to the classic piano notes.,"It creates an aspect of darkness and terror, like something in an electronica haunted house.","I am not as much a fan of the particular sound, but I think it does a very good job of using one extra tool to accomplish a very different goal.",The comments for explanation also helped.,"My suggestion would be to set the volume initially low and allow others to ramp it up because it blasted out my speakers on accident the first time I used it, although this was partially my fault for keeping the speakers up too high for the last patch.",The patch sends a metro to a subpatch containing two small sequencers attached to MIDI outputs and back out to an sfplay~.,"The sounds are cacophonous and a little grating, but not in a way that hurts the ears.",It's irritating but not painful.,Spot on with the stated intention.,"As for how it might be improved, it'd be nice to use comments over messages.",The message boxes attached to nothing cause some cognitive dissonance.,The work opened in two different windows and looked pretty organized.,"There was a few comments to help navigate the program, I found that helpful.",I read the description and saw it would be irritating which I was not very happy with but it was still a very solid piece.,"I love the setup and the help it provides, I just dislike the sound itself.","The look of the patch is pretty clean, and easy to figure out what was going on in each step.","Since the patch is simple, making the patch work was pretty simple as well since all you had to do was click on the toggle switch.","The song that was played was ""Happy Birthday"" and one part of the sequencer played the melody and the other played a simple chord like beat.",A pretty neat little idea to make the song have more depth.,I really can't think of any criticism to give since it was pretty straight forward and easy to see what was going on.,"First off, the work looks clean and cohesive without looking too complicated.","Technically, the patch works really nicely with no known errors.","The author created a simple piece of music, namely the happy birthday theme, and it made me feel good due to how well made it it.","Overall, I don't have much to say in terms of feedback as it's overall good.",The patch plays Happy Birthday but not just the melody!,It looks like there are accompanying chords but unfortunately all you hear is a bass line.,This adds a lot but it unfortunate because you can see that the intent is to play chords.,I enjoy how there are two different sequencers happening at once.,The idea is simple and so I didn't feel much other than just seeing the nuts and bolts of the patch.,My suggestion would be to have three 'make a bleeps' instead of trying to play each note of the triad through one.,The sequencer does play a recognizable tune of Happy Birthday.,It achieves this by the use of many selects hooked to numbers for bleeps.,"The overall concept was there, but because the timing system was rigid to only having beats in time with the single metronome some of the bleeps were out of time for the song.",The note timing could be changed by implementing a delay object between the select and the message for the note.,"By doing this, you could ""hold"" the bang for however long you want, only sending the message after the specified amount of time.","The patch looks great, I can see that the creator has made both a melody and a harmony.","The patch worked fine, except I think that there were supposed to be some chords in the harmony, but there was only one speaker and the creator didn't wire it so that all three sounds in the chords could play at the same time so only one of the three notes came through.","Still, I'm glad that they had both the melody and the harmony instead of just the melody like the other patches I've looked at.",Just fix the issue with the chords.,Maybe add two more speakers so that all three notes can play at the same time.,The patch looks like what we discussed in class when learning how to build sequencers.,"There are two metronomes that trigger the piano sounds to run, each playing in different octaves than the other and at different speeds.","After hearing it for more than 20 times being looped, it begins to get redundant and kind of bothersome.",Maybe because they aren't playing in a specific key and don't really have any melody.,I would work on creating a melody if you ever build a sequencer again.,"Based off of the description for this project, it was clear to me that this patch was built to play a sequence of notes that make up a melody.",There is no possible way for me to misunderstand what the author is trying to accomplish.,The way that this patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the top toggle.,"The toggle then activates the two multicolored buttons and two metro objects which then activate the counters, which range from 1-24 on each side.","The counters are attached to two different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1-24, which are attached to different colored buttons.","The buttons then are attached to a hidden and background checkbox, which can be selected to hide the buttons.",These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a numbered message attached to each input.,"The number is attached to each input, and is then attached to a number object, which shows what number it received.","This object is then attached to a makenote object and a noteout object that plays different notes based off of the individual number message it receives, it makes a sound.",The author managed to create a simple sequencer that played random notes that made up a melody.,The multicolored buttons served as a good visual feedback and was considerably different than the original sequencer we learned about.,Also the checkboxes that hid the buttons that were attached to the inputs for the select objects was also something that I thought was very interesting.,My only concrete suggestion would be to possibly omit the number object that is directly attached to the metro object.,I feel as though it does not really serve a purpose being there.,"I think that the overall of your patch looks really great, but the sequence of the note is quite simple.",I think you should make it more complicate like a music note.,"The adjustable on your project is the strongest point because I can adjust the appearance of the button, the blink color, the outliner color, and the playing speed, however to make it better, you may need to add more creativity to it.",I like the design of the patch it is colorful and without it It just another confusing patch.,I like that you did not create a song but instead create something random.,I also like that you created two sets to play at the same time.,This patch could be better if you were to clean it up.,Overall good job I like that you did it random.,"The patch was pretty big, filled to the brim with notes and selects and was quite colorful.",The patch works just as it's supposed to with no problems to be found.,"I think what may help with the patch is to put the instruction as a comment in the patch, other than that, it's not bad at all.","When I initially opened the patch, it looked very simple but once I clicked on the sub patch, I saw that it wasn't so simple.",I really liked the idea to keep it condensed and basic because the creator of the patch also gives the user the freedom to make there own tones and tempo.,"The actual technical was pretty intense once you go into the sub patch, there were a lot of different sounds and numbers involved.","Conceptually, it was pretty fun, nothing to crazy or advanced.","However, I did enjoy playing around with the patch.",Absolutely beautiful!,"The design is flawless, I love the simplicity of the main patch, it was easy to use and understand.",It was a treat to click on the subpatch and see the inner workings of it.,It was visually beautiful and looks like it was done with great care.,I felt totally in awe of the work.,"If only the sounds it produced matched the visual beauty of the subpatch, but that could be a tall order considering the beauty!",What sound?,Maybe a harp;),"The first patch that opens just has the toggle to play the sound, I really like that design and you don't even have to look at the counter that is playing sound.","The music is great too, it is recognizable and classic, the only thing I wish that was different would be the breaks.",Because this tune is so well known when I heard it without rests it took me out of the song for a bit.,The organization is very good.,The use of subpatch makes it alot easier to look at.,As for the overall product playing the key jingle sounded very nice.,Good work on the sequencer I laughed a little when I heard the jingle.,Maybe one way to improve would be putting in a message so that the user can change up the notes to create his or her own melody.,"I think that the overall of your patch looks really awesome, I love the way that you paint your button (Black - White - Black), it's so simple, but elegant, regardless I think that your project will look so much better if you combine your main patch and your sub patch together, so the user can see how beautiful your entire project is with out clicking at the sub patch.",The sequence of the note is beautiful.,"I found that you have two modes to play the song,  the auto play,and the manual play mode.",However I discovered that it will be more interesting if you combine those two together.,"What I mean is that when you play the music automatically, you also control it yourself in the same time.","The result will be incredible because you can add more dynamic, and diversity to the repetitive sequence.",This patch was simple and worked perfectly.,I loved the theme and the colors used.,"The patch offered comments to guide me through the process, I found this very helpful.","I think if it was aligned a bit better it would look cleaner, but thats just being picky.","Your work is very well composed, follow the theme that we learned in class with the buttons, it's easy to read and understand.",The colors and use of presentation mode give it a cool look and very pleasing aesthetic.,"The patch works great once you turn the speaker on, playing a version of the mario them song.","The only thing I would suggest is creating a separate metro with a different time setting so not all the notes would be in a 4/4 pattern, this way it would sound just like the real thing.","When in patching mode, it was very clean and easy to see what was going on, and the usage of color was really nice.","When you go into presentation mode, you got a little light show when you clicked on the toggle switch.","When I played it, I smiled and was hit with a wave of nostalgia since it was the Mario theme from world 1-1.","The sequencer itself is pretty simple and not too complicated, and runs fine when the switch was clicked on.","In presentation mode, each note is represented by a color and that color matches in the patch flow.",I can think of nothing to really improve what was already created since it was nicely done and well executed.,The first thing that I notice about the patch is that the color incorporated really gets your attention and engages you to want to interact with the patch.,I also like the actually simpliestic written instruction of play and sound on that are brightly colored.,"The functionally is great, you can tell that you pushed yourself by doing a higher number sequence and trying to challenge yourself to create a song that is recognizable.","The simplicity of operating it is very easy, which makes the user interaction fun and non-intimidating.",The creation of the Super Mario brothers theme song was a flash back to the past and I brought me back to my childhood video games.,I thought you did a good job and that the song was recognizable.,The only potential recommend will probably come as the skill set grows in the calls.,I know it is definitely creating longer pauses in-between notes to make the song that much more recognizable.,"The sounds for this project are all correct when it comes to the Mario theme song, but honestly, either the tempo is off or there needs to be more spaces and stuff for pauses that actually happen in the song.","Technical-wise, there is nothing wrong with this project.",It has lots of number values that all show up and a lot of connections to things that are everywhere but I have no problem with it as long as your patch works.,"You created the Mario Theme Song w/o rhythm, basically, which isn't bad.","I enjoyed it, but I currently just played this out loud in a lab and all these people in here were like ""oh my god, is that the Mario theme?""",The file is unable to be downloaded.,"Unfortunately, I cannot download the max patch.",When I click on download it takes me to a screen full of code.,The visual element sounded really neat though!,Couldn't open it.,I don't know how to open this since it was uploaded as a text file.,Please zip the work next time.,I was initially overwhelmed by the patch when I first opened it due to the 4 long rows of keyboards with connections resembling tangled ropes.,"However, after actually playing the patch, I realized it was far less complicated than it seemed to be and actually left me feeling a bit UNDERwhelmed.",Basically the patch plays the same note 17 times at a metro rate of 200 and then starts over again.,Honestly I thought it was kind of boring and I thought he/she could have at least used more than one note to give it some kind of melodic/song-like qualities.,I'm still not sure how a patch can look so intricate and complicated and turn out to be this simple.,I love your layout very clean and easy to figure out.,Unfortunately I was not able to find your Sf Play button.,I am sad to not be able to hear your sequencer because Im assuming you applied music theory to make you melody happen.,"At first glance, the patch is organized very well, but it still seems confusing as to what is going on and what the user is supposed to do.","I wasn't sure if I was supposed to program the sequencer to play what I wanted, or if there was a default loop that was to be played.",The patch works using a metro object that outputs bangs to various kslider objects to receive output.,I would improve this by making it more clear what the user is supposed to accomplish.,When I first opened this patch I expected a lot more.,A very solid patch and works perfectly (I think).,I wasn't certain if if there was more to the patch or if the extra keyboards just served as graphic entertainment.,I would improve by adding comments.,"It's pretty massive, and I had to zoom way out to see everything that was going on.",It looks like it was replicating the same sound over six visual keyboards.,"It did operate simple enough since all I had to do was click on the switch, and the paths were easy enough to see what was going to what.",I had to read the description to know what I was supposed to hear other wise I wouldn't have a clue since the visual keyboards didn't convey what keys were being hit.,Maybe adding that visual part so that the view can see what the notes are would be something that can be improved.,"Other than it, the patch was simple to understand in terms of flow, and usability.",The Zelda sequencer worked through a metro which sent bangs to a counter.,The counter then sent incrementing numbers to a select which then passed a bang out the corresponding output every time a correct number was passed to it.,The bangs from the select then sent a note message to the make a bleep sub patch.,"It seems from listening to the melody as though the velocity or duration of the notes varies, some notes seem to ring longer than others while all being attached to the same metro.",I think I would enjoy this patch more if it used the midi notes instead of the bleep sounds.,I initially turned on your patch with no idea how it would sound because I'm not a fan of Zelda at all.,I never liked the game so I already have bias.,"When I turned on your patch, it was a melody of sorts that I think I remember hearing while I played it, which is a good thing.","It's got a lot of number values when it comes to technicality, and you offer help to any user who decides to play your patch.","It makes me laugh inside my head, because I am currently in the DC Lab but I enjoyed the simple patch that you had.","Opens up a simple sequence and has the user presses the toggle to play ""Zelda's Lullaby.""",Connects to p make_a_bleep.,"It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter.","It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.","It was interesting that the sequence connects several of the select bang points to single points (each time to sequence/melody hits B, the point is connected to a single 83).","While this isn't as easy to see the rests or the individual points when the melody hits B as a string, it makes it more condensed.",The patch looks fairly simple with a few things standing out.,There are a lot of good notes written about how the patch works!,It plays Zelda's Lullaby.,I feel like this was a good choice.,"This sequencer is pretty simple and only plays one line at a time however, you can change the speed of the sequencer which I hadn't seen till now.",This is a really cool addition.,I felt reminiscent of the old days while using this patch.,I enjoyed it because of the association with my childhood memories.,My overall suggestion would be to add another musical line to accompany the melody using another sequencer and to make sure that when using a very recognizable song that it plays the same.,The notes are in fact right but I think some of the rhythms/rests are a little funky.,This is a small thing but I feel like it would make it that much better!,"This patch is an attempt to replicate Zelda's Lullaby, from The Legend of Zelda.","The system is easy to understand based on its layout, although its not entirely easy to figure out which counts don't output notes.",It follows the simple sequencer structure of using a metro to count and selecting notes based on the count; there isn't anything surprisingly unique about this patch technically.,"The music actually sounds pretty close to the original song, which makes me remember playing the Legend of Zelda games when I was a child.","The author could try adding in more notes to replicate the entire song, or some background notes.","Simply, this project is too complex for me to understand.","I am not able to get it to play any sounds, so I am not sure as to what is going on.",Pressing buttons seems to make things happen yet no sounds come out.,"Technically, this patch seems beyond what we have learned.",I cannot comment more on this as it is currently.,"I would suggest making it simpler for someone like myself, with little Max experience and no music experience, to be able to make the patch work as intended.","The patch looks...well, far beyond the scope of this assignment.","I have no idea how this was put together, and frankly I can't see that someone without extensive prior experience with Max could either.","I'm sorry, but that's the extent of my technical analysis.","I will say, however, from a user standpoint it is far from intuitive.",This is the kind of machine that requires training to use effectively.,It took me five minutes to figure out why it wasn't making sound.,The volume slider did nothing until it was almost maxed out.,I'm still not sure what all the various toggles were for.,"I played around with this for quite a while, but I can't bring myself to think that I'm any closer to understanding it.",The patch was a customized 8 beat sequencer/sampler that allows the user to make their own sequences.,It included a killer Donna Summers tune as a demo as well.,"Complete with beat counters and tempo control, this patch is an advanced and very clever piece of work.",There were several meters and toggles that controlled volume and whether or not the sound would play.,It also included its own keyboard for the user to compose their 8 beat masterpiece.,"My favorite touch was the title and how the ""III"" had the colors behind it that corresponded with the different sections of the patch.","Overall, I was amazed by the work put into this patch and how well it turned out.","I am not sure if I could offer a single improvement, it's great!",I hope to learn a lot of the technology used in this patch in the future!,"Well, i do have to say this patch does look great both in presentation mode and out of it.",The patch is a little complex for my knowledge but works well and does seem useful if you did want to make a little more complex song.,Not sure how exactly it works but it does.,The variety of the sounds and all the levels is awesome.,This made me feel like there is so much to max that can and will be useful.,To my knowledge I'm not sure how this could improve.,Right off the bat I could tell this patch a lot of thought put into it.,"It a colorful, yet simplistic and organized interface that was fairly simple to use.","I was glad the author designed a presentation mode interface, because I think if I were faced with the raw patch I would have been utterly confused.","That said, a few parts of the raw patch(non presentation) were a bit disorganized, but I think that might be because they were the visual components.",The patch was an elaborate 16 beat sequencer that played a series of notes defined by the user by clicking and unclicking boxes.,"I was a bit confused on how to work the patch at first, but eventually I figured it out, maybe a little blurb about directions in the future?","In addition, to that suggestion, when opening and playing the patch, I couldn't hear the sounds being played until increasing the volume almost all the way to the top/right of the slider.",This was misleading because the volume appeared to be half-way up.,The striking red outline of all the components is the first thing that catches my eye upon opening the patch; it sets the mood quite well for the song that is being played.,The sequencers have been arranged side by side with all the connections twisting about each other as they go into the message boxes.,"The metronome command and toggle play both, producing the easily recognizable melody from the grand composition.","It is a stirring composition, and hearing it in bleep/bloop format is quite interesting, as if it was an NES game that the track had been taken from.",My only suggestion of improvement would be playing with the piano note synthesizer to put it into classical format.,The patch is a two-part sequencer designed to play a song with polyphony.,"It uses the methods taught in class, with two ""make a bleep"" objects for polyphony/harmony.","The author creatively interpreted sheet music according to Max methods to try and represent a performance of a popular song, and the result is fun to play with.","In the description, the author expresses confusion as to how to represent eighth notes, which could have been achieved with relative ease by adding more steps to the counter (and consequently the sequencer), increasing the metronome tempo, and adding rests.","Moreover, a few added steps/rests at the end of the sequence would have matched the represented tune to a full bar of the song.","In general, this project is successful.","I really enjoyed this work, it was simple to understand as soon as I opened it, the colors were please to the eye and I knew exactly where to go first.",As soon as I hit the toggle I was able to recognize the song.,I liked how you did one metro in half time to even up the chords along with the lead part.,"Overall very good representation of this piece through ""bleeps!""",The overall look of this sequencer is very similar to the ones we did in class although there is another component which acts as a left hand and a right hand.,I like the song it makes me happy and is something I can listen to on repeat cause its fun.,The song is well done and flows smoothly.,I think it needs more creative components to it such as visuals or something the user can interact with to make it more fun but over all it was good work.,A really cool song!,I liked how the left hand and the right hand were different tempos.,"The patch is really simple to use, all you have to do is click a button.","After listening to the song for about a minute, I felt relaxed.",I liked the set up of the patch because it looks a lot like mine.,"Toggle connected to two metronomes, one set at half speed to the other.","Splits into 18 and 30 channels of notes, left hand playing chords and right hand playing melody.","Well crafted and nice use of chords, simple design, effective.","I like the tune, it has an interesting melody.",Concept is basic but well done.,May have been interesting to show speaker or additional hidden elements to create a more interesting visual appearance.,Volume controls could have also been added to isolate the different parts.,"The patch has a fairly simple layout; there is a main toggle that activates the ""right hand"" and ""left hand.""","I don't know if it's just how I'm hearing it after a few times through, but it seems to get a little out of sync as it goes on.","I enjoy the concept, and it sounds nice overall.","Maybe with a little more time, the note duration and synchronizing could be perfected.",Upon opening the patch I can see that it's very well laid out and clean as to give the viewer an understanding of how everything in ran and what it's being connected to.,The set up to the patch it pretty straight forward in terms of the technical aspect of it.,"There are two parts, one for the left hand, and the other for the right hand.",There are two separate tempo meters to give it a more of a feel that a pianist is playing the song.,"It's all done by a click of the switch, and the smoothing tones of the Jontron theme are playing.",It's also fairly accurate too.,I can think of nothing that the creator can do better on since everything was laid out and everything made sense.,"It was a well designed patch, and it sounded very much like the song provided.","Your patch is nice and consolidated, but I found it slightly confusing.",I couldnt tell how the first two gates changed things.,I enjoyed the music you made though.,"The comment boxes helped, though a few more that told me what did what could help.",I enjoyed the blending of samples and midi.,"I found it to be a pleasant melody in general, and how the patch worked was pretty easy to figure out.",GIving the user the option to raise levels on the individual samples was pretty cool.,"Conceptually, you did a pretty good job of blending melody and rhythm into an interactive experience.",My only suggestion would be to raise the bpm a wee bit.,"I like the interaction with the patch, how I was able to switch things and control the volume of the different sounds.",The patch is a complicated sequencer designed to play different concordant sequences.,It achieves this using switches and several sequencers designed using the in-class method.,"Conceptually, it achieves much of the beauty and spontaneity it intends to; I'm surprised to hear the different sounds.","Still, the volume sliders are a bit unnecessary and erratic, as it's not immediately obvious why not all of the sounds are audible.","Additionally, the patch could be improved with more sounds or greater complexity, such that clicking one of the switches would have an immediately obvious effect.",So far this one takes the cake.,The interface was easy to use and intuitive.,"There were a number of objects in this patch that I didn't recognize, but the signal flow looks essentially the same as what we saw in class.",Since this was a dynamic sequencer rather than a song loop I'm not sure if I have the know-how to say with any certainty how this patch works.,"It was fun to mess around with, and ultimately generated some interesting sounds.",I would have liked there to be more comments.,"There were some number boxes whose function was ambiguous, amongst other things and instructions would have helped.","When opening the patch, it was pretty big and had to scroll down to get the sound going.","Technically, it worked well and didn't run into much problems upon starting the song.","As the creator described, the song is original, but it is inspired by daft punk and it felt alright to use.",A suggest I have to put down is to keep decrease the size of the make a bleep command and the sound toggle.,"So, a toggle sends a 1 to two different metros which then send bangs to three separate sets of counters/selects.","The sounds are very spaceship-esque (very sci-fi), the track with the metro (set at just 3 miliseconds!)",just starts sounding gnawing.,"I realize they were going for the three sounds to be together, but it just sounds droning.","However, I do like the two other parts together.","If I had done this one, I would have just used two metro/counter/select pairs, and just had one select output go to two different make_a_beeps.","Also, I slowed down the metronome on the short one and the whole thing became more musically interesting.",Your patch was relatively neat and straightforward.,The original creation was pleasing to listen to so well done with your creative freedom for this project.,I hope your brain wasn't hurt too much in your previous efforts in changing the sound file.,I wonder what you were trying to do in more technical terms so that perhaps in the future you could complete what you originally intended.,"In any case, good job!",You did the class assignment with some added creativity.,This patch has three sequencers in it rather than the usually expected two.,The third one adds an extra element of sound by having all the tones continuously going off at the same time to produce a constant undertone.,The other two cycle through an eight-note sequencer to produce a sci-fi like melody that plays on repeat.,"It sound great with the undertone going, but can feel rather stock/cliche after the first few times cycling through.",My suggestion for improvement would be either experimenting with tempo or adding in effects that can alter/distort the individual notes in a manner that the sound can change and keep pleasing listeners.,"The patch looked similar to what I originally wanted to do, which was cool.",I can't imagine how long it took them to develop that funky song.,"The overall layout of the patch was nice, it wasn't too organized but that is also a personal preference, On a technical note, the patch functions just right, all the numbers that relate to the make a note sub patch are really awesome and well thought out.","Conceptually, I had a lot of fun playing with this patch and listening to the music that they created.","I honestly enjoyed the strange Star Trek, Power Ranger-y song.",I enjoyed that the sequencer was exactly what was asked for; simple.,I also liked the use of midi notes.,"I also ran into the issue of not being able to do multiple ""hands"" well.","So again, I have other versions of my patch, but I still submitted what was the most simplistic to ensure it would work correctly.",The patch has a nice layout and they didn't choose to have the sound come from a second patch.,"By routing the select to the same notes they didn't need to repeat the sounds in the beginning, but they did repeat notes later in the song.",It worked as planned.,"The design of the sequencer reflected that of what was constructed in class, which is perfectly fine.","The sequencer was activated through the button object, which played the tune of Fur Elise.","Overall, a good attempt at creating a sequencer.",The music was enjoyable to listen to and the design of the sequencer was familiar enough that did not leave me confused or overwhelmed.,"The creator of the sequencer had trouble with additions to the notes, which can be attributed to the lack of time available in constructing our sequencers.","If the user had more time, his/her work could have been more complete.","Therefore, the only suggestion I could make was the addition of a sequencer branch to make the composition sound more fuller.","Overall, nice job!","I liked the overall layout of the patch, it didn't feel to clustered or jam-packed.","Technical speaking, I also enjoyed the patch.",There were somethings in the patch that I didn't even know were possible with MAX.,"For example, how they just connected the first two numbers four times into the select object, thus creating the repetition in the first part.",The overall conceptual idea of the patch was pretty simple but how they pulled it off made the patch truly enjoyable for the user.,This patch takes the piano and plays the beginning of Beethoven's 5.,"The author does a similar job of hooking up a metronome, select command, although changes and runs the Piano in a slightly different way in the code than previous authors did.",I like the feeling of quaintness of the patch and it made me feel classical with the music selection.,The author could have added saw~ or extra buttons to make the experience different or more interactive.,"This is a very complex sequencer hidden behind a giant button playing ""Comptine d'Un Autre ’_t’©- Die fabelhafte Welt der Am’©lie.""","I understand the flow of it for the most part, but I get a little lost in it since it is complex.",I wish I could offer more critique.,"It was a little redundant that there is a button between the metro and counter, when it could just connect the metro directly to the counter.","It was also redundant to put the button between the select and numbers when it could directly be connected, but I can understand that it would give a visual for where the counter is along the melody.",This is amazing.,I love it.,I'm saving it for future reference because this is too cool.,It was very user friendly with the large button.,I didn't realize how much would be hiding behind it.,Great work.,"This patch is a simple button that plays a song, with bass and melody.",It seems complex yet is presented in an easy-to-use way.,"Technically, the patch works just as a normal sequencer, using a metro to play the base and another metro to control the melody.",There are many more metros and counters within each to control the timing of everything.,"The author created a nice-sounding song without using a complicated method, so I can still understand how it works with my basic Max knowledge.","I would suggest making it easier to access the sub-patches for critique, and commenting the work.","This is a beautiful patch, that really could have done well with presentation mode.","The interface was simple but interesting and I appreciated the few notes, as well as the organized subpatches.","The sound had a lovely music box quality, and there was even layers of planning enough to have it come to a natural stop.",Well done.,"I would have loved more comments in the subpatches, as I didn't catch exactly what was going on at first.",Well done.,"Upon opening the Patch, I was quite amazed for ow simple it looked at first.","The patch works great despite how simple it looks, at the press of a single button it's all smooth sailing from here.",The creator made a simple song of sorts and it felt amazing that something could look so simple play such a greatly composed song.,I got nothing to say on technical feedback but I'm really satisfied with the patch despite the loud beep at the beginning.,"The design is really great, the colors are pleasant and I could just stare at it for hours.",The technical parts were hidden and didn't distract from the overall look.,"I love this patch, it makes me want to step up my game and try a little harder.","The song is nice, not sure what it was or if you made it, but good job.",Its easy to follow with the top down structure.,Including the piano as a visual aid is also a good idea.,The song kind of made me feel like I was in a western saloon.,A suggestion might be to maybe soften up some of the hard notes or maybe extend them to flow better.,This is the first patch I've seen that doesn't use the 'make a bleep' sub patch and I felt like hearing the piano sound separated this one quite a bit from others.,"Also, multiple notes are being played a once which is very cool.",This is the most impressive technical part.,Using commas to keep all of the note numbers in one message box so that they will be played together.,I felt joyful listening to the light carefree music and also watching the patch work efficiently.,Maybe there is a way to condense all of the numbers so that it doesn't look as cluttered.,Upon opening the patch I was initially put off by the organization.,There seemed to be numbers and connection strings everywhere and it overwhelmed me a little.,"However, after I pressed play I was really, really impressed with the composition he/she had created.","I had never heard this piece before and although it was a pretty basic piano track, this person implemented the use of chords in addition to individual notes.","I'm not sure I would even know how to do that myself yet, so I applaud the creator of this patch.",I really don't think I would suggest doing anything differently except maybe organizing it in a way that is more user friendly - making it easier to comprehend the construction to really understand what exactly is going on.,The patch uses make a note.,It works great and plays notes and chords.,The sound produced is more like a real piano which was very nice to hear.,"It uses a counter, from 1 to 48, to sequence the notes to be played.",It definitely made me say Š—“WOWŠ—!,It also shows that a lot of care and work went into the program.,"I am glad the connection chords are routed behind the note numbers, and I can see how this got very complicated.","The only suggestion I could make would be to tame the spaghetti chords in the back, but that is a personal preference.","In the old days, we called some code Š—“spaghetti codeŠ— when the paths weren't clear.",One way to do that would be to break up the work into multiple select statements working off of the same counter.,"That would break it up into more manageable pieces, or bars, and make it easier to maintain or modify.","However that said, I know many artists who like the organic nature of exposed wires and find them beautiful.","There's a ton of notes here making the appearance look somewhat messy, but it still follows the same design shown to us in class, and the key buttons to make it run smoothly are easily identifiable.","This patch goes starts with the toggle, goes through the metro,and then goes on to select the desired notes after counting through 48 beats.",A midi key board is included at the bottom to give a visual representation of what notes are being selected.,I like that you chose a classical piece and included piano sounds over the bleep sounds.,The piano sounds just add to the authenticity since you've chosen a classical piano piece in the first place.,"It works nicely, and sounds good.","There's not much I can say to add due to the fact that this a piano piece, and you've constructed this patch to do exactly that, play the piano piece.",Well done!,"It looked interesting enough to look at and i was looking forward to use it but the sound was not playing for me, i turned on the speakers in the program and i made sure all sound files were properly placed in the same folder as the project so it would work.",Right off the bat this patch looks super interesting.,I see three sound boxes so I immediately assume that whatever it will produce will be pretty elaborate.,"Upon 'dropping the beat' I was pretty impressed with what you created, it was cool to see how much you could really do with this assignment.","I really enjoyed this patch, it was different and it mades me wish I tried harder.",I didn't recognize some of the commands and I used the help to figure them out.,I overall really liked what they did.,This is a good patch and easy to follow based on the layout.,The volume sliders made this patch enjoyable.,being able to make the bass overpower the rest (as well as my computer speakers) was a bit of fun.,Changing the volume was a nice touch.,"To improve you could add different types of imported bass, just as a little more variety.",The work is visually appealing and makes you want to engage with the patch.,I really like that you pushed yourself even though you said you did not have the knowledge of music.,Creating a counter up to 35 to incorporate the first two parts of Fur Elise was a way of definitely pushing yourself and that fact that it is clearly recognizable is great.,I would have never known that you did not have a greater understanding of music by this patch.,"A simple toggle button engages the metro with a counter measure of 1-35, which feeds into your output to engage the specific keys to the Fur Elise song.",I don't really know any suggestions that I could make because I think it is great peice.,Maybe another layer could be adding color to the piece.,Great job is getting the assignment done and making a neat max patch.,Considering you do not have a music training background your efforts to transcribe the song are commendable.,The sequencer is easily recognizable as the beginning to Fur Elise.,"If you were given more time I'm sure you'd practice the nuances of rests by placing in ""blank"" select slots with the proper metro designations, but this easily becomes complicated with a piece of Beethoven.",Well done!,I had to turn the sound on.,But after that it worked.,I enjoyed the lay out.,I felt it was easy to follow and how the project was achieved.,I could easily replicate.,I feel this is an important feature of any project such as this; Can I see how you did what you did so I could make it.,The sequencer was simple in design and easy to control.,"The song ""Fur Elise"" was played when the sequencer was activated through the button objects.","Due to the lack of knowledge with music, the creator did mention that he received a majority of help through Youtube and was able to construct the sequencer to play the same tune.","The sequencer was not complicated, which is great for those who get overwhelmed easily.",The only suggestion I could make was to at least attempt to create a different song...maybe an original song in order to better understand music.,"It is difficult to understand music when you have had no prior experience with music composition, but time and practice can change that difficulty level to a simpler one.","Overall, it was a good sequencer and song, but I would have liked to see more originality in the design and music design.",Very simple patch.,I like the choice of music selection also.,First off this patch is way to big this does not fit my screen!,You could of made the buttons a bit smaller.,next is the colorful scheme which I enjoy it makes the patch more intriguing.,The sound however is very subliminal.,I feel like I am listening to some sort of art installation and all you are missing is a video display.,Overall its a nice patch just needed to be a bit smaller no need for those excessively big buttons.,"Very technical appearance, with big pretty buttons all over the place and wires going in every direction.","Still I don't feel it looks messy at all, since the toggle object stands tall in purple at the top of the patch.","There seems to be many different metro-counter-select-make a bleep arrangements going on simultaneously with the wav files you have included with the ""sfplay.""","You've obviously included some sort of message behind this piece, with the random ""life doesn't give a f**k's"" and robotic woman speaking over the bleep sounds.","The message may be obscure, but with that comes a certain level of curiosity that makes this patch compelling.",I don't know if there's much to change here.,"The layout may be complex, but getting the patch to run is very simple and that's all that really matters.","Although confusing to work and hear, the patch was aesthetically pleasing.",And the sounds seemed to mesh well together.,Awesome.,First of all it looks great.,Secondly your samples are creative and I find the cheerful bloopy almost childlike melody over the raw hard samples a nice contrast.,"One thing I would think be cool, although possibly contrary to your artistic image would be to have the melody and samples playing in time to create a more music scene overall.","WOW, was definitely my first impression.","The intricacies of the piece are incredible and the incorporation of the various size component and colors; green, yellow and red give it a level of initial visual intensity that is definitely engaging.",Once you turn on the piece you realize the greater level of artistic flow.,"For me, this piece invoked a strong feeling angst, listen to the layering of the words takes me to the challenges I have faced in life when I felt someone how I was entitled to a better outcome.",I really do not have any suggestions for improvement.,"This piece was very thought invoking, more so than any piece I have seen......great artistic expression!","This patch had be laughing so hard, it was done so well and it could almost replace 2Chainz in that song.","It had a simple feel to it, with a normal toggle just like the example from class.","The use of the ""open"" feature was cool because you were able to use samples to create a drum beat, sounding just like the real thing, and the vocal samples that you could include were just the icing on the cake.",Love it!,The patch when I first opened it was pretty cool.,I enjoyed that it wasn't just a basic looking Max patch but rather a fun bright patch.,"Just from looking at the patch, you can identify that the creator spent a good about of time on creating it.","On a technical stand point, it functioned perfectly once I loaded the additional sounds on to my computer.",The song was completely recognizable and was super fun to play around with.,I enjoyed how to the creator made it fun to listen to and how it was easily recognizable.,I really liked this patch.,Very nice Patch 2Chainz!,I can tell you are a fan of his music.,"I very much enjoy this piece, its very different from other patches.",The beat is almost exactly like the song.,Very cool and creative patch I really enjoy this.,You could of change the button color scheme like gold and red but thats my opinion.,"Toggle connected to two metronomes, one connected to melody while the other is playing drum sample.",Additional buttons allow user to play additional samples.,Interactive and includes graphics.,"Works well and fun to play with, clearly illustrated.",This was my favorite as it combined samples and interactive graphic components.,Simple but easy to use and shows musical talent based on compositional elements.,Could have added other samples and made the loop longer.,Maybe some additional graphics?,"There is a nice combination of color in this, purple and yellow, but the rest of the patch has been laid out in typical fashion, a good thing to do.","The interesting aspect of this patch is the inclusion of the open command and sfplay~ command in loading vocal sound files in time with the notes being played on the other sequencer, and the command of being able to play sound files on command by pressing one of the two additional buttons included.",While the technical aspects are very interesting I do not care much for the actual sound/music because I am not a fan of rap.,I think that working the button commands into the sequencers by turning it into more of a sound mixing board where audio can be played on demand in a way that alters the flow of the track would be awesome.,"Super cool and very complicated code under a super clean presentation mode.",There are four parts.,The main part plays constantly at the default volume.,The other three parts of the music are inaudible at first but are controlled by sliders that made this patch both interactive and fun to use.,This was an extremely well thought out patch.,I played with it for too long because now the tune is stuck in my head!,"At first I couldn't get the fourth part to play, but this was a minor issue.",I went back to the download file and there was a folder in a folder.,In order to hear the fourth part I had to put all the sound bites from both folders onto my desktop.,"A small operation but well worth the effort, because the patch was so cool?",Very nice yet complicated visually.,The patch was pretty complex visually but worked flawlessly.,The instructions served to get me started and were much appreciated.,The patch was organized neatly and was visually pleasing.,I really enjoyed the melodies as well.,"The only thing is maybe one comment to tell me exactly where the volume bars are, since I am a noob it took me a second or two to figure it out.",Great patch!!!,Thank you,This is so nice.,"Firstly, I thought it was very interesting that the author decided to use sound files to play each note instead of using the MIDI messages to trigger an instrument.","Regardless, the program turned out wonderfully.","I liked the presentation mode and how each beat triggered a ""light"" which was really just a button.",The program runs by using a metro object that sends bangs to various messages that contain MIDI number values.,It seems as if the author correlated the number values with .aif files of each of the notes she/he needed.,I would suggest that it may have more functionality to use a midi instrument since that would give the sequencer more usability in a music setting.,"Regardless, it is a wonderful program.","This patch has three main blocks of components, all pretty large.","The left-most part was actually cut off and had to be moved so I could see all of the parts, which could have just been an issue with my screen resolution being smaller than the one in which the patch was made.","It seems pretty intricate, though, and probably took a lot of work to get right.","It works by pressing the large square button that has a few ""press to start"" messages surrounding it, which triggers three different metronomes to start and play beats through counters and select objects.",I really enjoyed this patch.,"I've always been a (very) casual LoZ fan, and very much enjoyed all of the music/songs that are part of the games.","The song sounded really nice, very calming and serene.","To improve the work, my main suggestion would be to better organize the patch.","All of the metronomes had the same interval, so only one was really needed, and one ""make a bleep"" probably would have been enough, however I didn't mess with it much to see if there were multiple copies for a reason.",I enjoyed seeing the songs people picked to play.,The noise of the synth matches the tonality of the video game.,So I enjoyed that link.,"(Pun intended) I felt it was cumbersome in parts, or the spacing of the notes was off.","However, overall, this was a very good project.",The patch sequences the song starting with a single toggle which is hooked to three identical metros.,From there each metro is hooked to a counter with the arguments 1 48.,Then through three selects the patch sends note numbers to make a bleep objects.,"I'm not completely familiar with the tune, but it felt as though there were some awkwardly long pauses in the melody.",Also this patch could have been achieved with 2 fewer metros and counters.,"Rather than make identical objects, consider making a single master time keeper, and then use send and receive to pass the information to different sections of the patch.",Overall it would be cleaner and perform better as the complexity of works increases.,Initially I opened it partially expecting what I would get out of the patch in the end.,As if the title didn't give it away.,"it looked pretty good when I opened it, maybe it could have been organized better, but that is just my opinion.","There were also good comments to help the user touch what they should, and not touch what they shouldn't.","When I started the patch, my suspicions were verified.",It was indeed the song of storms.,It made me feel good.,I especially enjoyed the fact that I could change the speed of it.,"Overall, It was wonderful.",The only suggestions I can make are to set bounds on adjustable number objects.,"Other than that, Awesome job!",Legend of Zelda is awesome!,Great and simple sequencer.,Polyphonic and great choice in music.,I don't know how it can be improved upon.,I'm just enjoying the song as I write this review.,"Sonically, this is the most interesting piece so far, as it uses more than just the built-in MIDI tones.","The patch looks a little busy, but with everything that was included, it has to be.","The whole process is activated with a single toggle, which runs various subpatches playing the notes.","The description given for the concept is a little confusing, but I like the outcome.","I think this may have worked out better if I understood the goal of the author, so maybe just making things a little more clear.",The patch looks kinda complicated since it has many objects we didn't learn about.,The sound of the patch was nice to listen to and sounded very futuristic.,"I liked it very much because it had a ""whoosh"" sound at the end and I thought it was cool and wondered how to make that.","The patch worked correctly, it played a song over and over again.",There were symbols at the top of the patch that I wasn't quite sure what they did at first but then I understood that they were two parts of the song and that it combined them together.,I thought it was really neat way of doing that.,"Maybe for improvement make the patch a little less cleaner, ti seems very spread out.","The patch looks a bit complex, yet the buttons used to control the patch are simple.",It seems to work through subpatches with their own metros and counters that cause notes to play.,"There are two different 'songs' that are playing, which can both be triggered off and on.",Technically it seems that it works well but could have been organized better.,"Conceptually, the patch feels unique yet not something that I personally find interesting or nice to listen to.",I believe someone more interested in music would find this patch to be interesting.,I suggest making the patch more organized or commenting with the purpose for various things.,The patch was clean and slightly complex at the same time which is good.,"The song piece, which was an original I'm guessing, was pretty cool.","I was a little confused by the number options (0, 1, -1, 0) because they didn't do anything as far as I could tell.",Overall it was a pretty clean and cool patch.,Super dope little loop you got there.,The interface was very simple to understand and use.,I like the reversed beat hit and the neat melody including bass tones.,I can actually listen to the loop for a while.,My only suggestion would be perhaps accentuating the simplicity of the patch's function by bringing it into presentation mode and making the interface even simpler.,The organization of the patch could be a little better but overal you did a very good job.,I enjoyed the sounds it brought me to a feeling of happiness.,Maybe adding a filter would go a long way with this patch.,"This, as soon as I opened it was very interesting and cool.",I like how you explained everything that went into the design of the patch.,And the actual song that played was very good and well put together.,I'm actually interested how you did quite a few things.. All in all the sequencer turned out sick and I think you've got this one down.,The complexity of the piece is extremely impressive.,This is far beyond anything I could fathom creating in max.,the intricacies of the piece are incredible and the incorporation of the 560 individual notes was outstanding.,The fact that you spent the extra time trying to understand  the programming aspect and simplifying the patch by adding the simple text file line by line made for a much easier user experience.,I also felt like you were trying to educate the user by adding the text boxes.,"I really appreciate this, because it gave clarity to parts of your patch that were over my head.",Once you turn on the piece you realize the greater level of artistic flow.,I really do not have any suggestions for improvement.,It might be fun to add a greater visual component by adding more color to the piece.,The patch is very well organized for how intense it is.,This is a really cool sequencer that plays Bach's Solfeggieto in numeric values.,There are several text files that call the numbers because there are so many which makes the patch very organized.,I am amazed that you had the time for this.,"The song is fantastic and seems really complicated and time consuming to go through all the sheet music, unless you put it through a translator.",The only thing I think would be really cool is if you made some visual components with it so it looked cool as well as sounded really cool.,"Overall, Good job!",The patch looks decently clean and simple for the complexity it involves.,My issue was that I wasn't for whatever reason able to hear anything.,The patch does include comments which are nice and seems to stray from the example made in class which is good because it shows other ways of achieving things.,I just wish I could've heard it.,The visual was very colorful i enjoyed looking at it.,The melody was excellent and i enjoy classical music as well.,I believe this person did the job and did it right.,"The patch is colorful and pleasing to the eye, simple and easy connections.",The music plays when the toggle is switched on and the same set of eight notes plays twice before one (or two) of the notes change higher or lower by a single note.,The process is repeated for the different colors and is a continuous loop.,I really like how the color changes for the buttons as their sound plays so that I knew exactly where I was.,I was excited and tried to guess which note would change next in the sequence and try to figure out if more than one changed.,For improvement I think it would be neat to add an accompaniment.,Looks simple and easy to use.,The colors add some fun to the project and I like how the chords change.,"The patch looks very nice, with the colors adding more interest instead of just the regular grey.",It works really well.,I like how you figured out how to change the notes without making it look confusing.,I feel like a lot of work was put into this even though it isn't complicated.,Some of the other ones I've seen just look like the minimum.,"My only suggestion would be to find a way to make it interesting, but hide the actual patch work, as if it were an actual app that was being marketed.",You wouldn't want the people who bought it to see all that wiring.,"Other than that, great job!",This colorful and all-around pleasing patch was a pleasure to see!,The toggle turns on a cute song that after 2 bars goes into 8 beats of a similar sequence of the same melody.,I honestly am not quite sure about how some of the things in it worked-but that's a compliment!,"It seems like a great next step to the simple sequencer assignment, so good job taking it to the next level!","There were different counters involved, so I assume that is how the song went to the different sections.",I really enjoyed the feel throughout the project!,It was very fun and seemed like something that could be a children's game (I mean that in a good way).,"I don't know if I could add an improvement other than making sure that you upload your file in the .zip format, it was a great project!",The patch is simple with visual buttons to see the sequence as it plays along with the additional numbers at the bottom that correspond to the keys of the keyboard.,It works by hitting the toggle and the sequence plays through and keeps looping until you turn it off.,I did not personally know the tune of Onett (before looking it up!),"but it sounded nice and concise, made me happy.",I suggest cleaning up the keyboard numbers a bit.,"Instead of on hookup to each number, there can be additional connections to the same note, they will just be played at a different time, depending on where the connection is in the sequence.","This patch was very similar to the tutorial, the only differences I could see were that it used a 16 counter instead of an 8 counter and had some rests/breaks.","That said, the tune it played was pretty.","I had never heard of the intended song or the game it was from, at least not until I did some googling and realized it was actually part of the ""Mother"" series.",This amused me because I follow a few people on tumblr who are utterly obsessed with the games so I know a bit about it.,"Anyway, that has nothing to do with the actual patch, but it did improve my overall experience because I was able to connect it to my own life.","I did notice that there was both a ""make a bleep"" and a ""bleep"" subpatch, and only the ""bleep"" one was needed, as I was able to delete the former(and it's connections) without the patch being broken.","The patch has a tree branch set up, with the individual buttons stemming from the counter function.",This patch did a good job of keeping a clean and professional look.,Functionality wise this patch is exemplary.,There were no technical issues playing the sequencer and it even had a nice little melody to it.,Great patch.,Simple and easy to understand.,Very similar to what was shown in class.,The patch is neat and works.,"The patch runs a simple metro/count/selector that apparently plays the Onett theme from Earthbound, though it's hard to recognize without varying note lengths.",There's also an unused make_a_beep subpatch.,It's simple and technically proficient.,I would work on creating variable note lengths.,"Toggle, Color, one metronome, notes, four parts, shifting chords, this does it all!",Obvious in depth understanding of the project and creative and interesting development of the work.,"Well organized and explained, this piece is user friendly and easy on the eyes and ears.","Hard to complain about this one, maybe could lead to a longer composition otherwise its bloody fantastic!!!","As a huge fan of horror movies, I was excited to hear this patch because the word ""eerie"" was in the title.","Upon opening the patch I loved the fact that she used color for the buttons, giving it some aesthetic appeal.","I really enjoyed the composition, and it didn't disappoint.",It was indeed eerie - something that you'd hear straight out of a paranormal movie.,The composition also included more than two notes playing at the same time which went beyond the bare minimum requirements.,"The combination of individual notes and chords really helped to give it that creepy repetitive feel, and there isn't anything that I would have changed about it.",I like the overall look of this patch.,It's easy to navigate and understand what I'm supposed to do to make it function properly.,I like how you got different chords to be struck using the metronome.,The different colors are helpful for me to see what notes are being activated throughout the melody.,"You composed a piece of music that is tranquil and not terrible to listen to over and over in any way, that's impressive considering you say you are not a musician or composer.",I feel like I'm learning more about Max just watching the buttons light up.,I'd suggest composing a longer melody.,"Description:When activated, this patch plays a tune that is the author's original composition.",The author makes expert use of polyphony in their work.,"Technical analysis:When pressed, a toggle sends a bang to a metro that counts every 300 ms. From there, a counter measures every eight counts.","If a note is to be played, a message containing the note value is sent to the ""make a bleep"" sub patch, and then a sine wave is generated.","Conceptual analysis:The piece is actually 4 times longer than I originally thought!","It counts through 8 beats four times, not just the same 8 beats.",The author is making a very good use of alternating selects and counts in the signal flow- meaning you can divide the piece into beats and measures by having a count that leads to a select that leads to another count that leads to another select.,The fact that the first two chords that the piece produces are very similar sounding creates a surprise moment when the last to measures sound completely different.,"Although the author says in the submission that they are not a musician or composer, I think this piece shows the author has  a clear understanding about the technical/ mathematical structure that music and programming have in common.","Also, the use of color in max patches is never bad- and at firs glance it looked like the author was simply placing colored buttons at random, they actually match the pitch of the note, which is a great way to convey to the user what is being activated when a sound is played.","Improvement:The only improvement that I can see with the patch is to take a look at the select object at the furthest left.","The comment pointing to it suggests that there is a rest on the 8th beat, but the 8th beat is actually not a rest, a note is played.",Other than that there is nothing of a technical nature wrong with the patch.,"One thing that the author should do, however, is be more confident in this work!",There is no need to lower expectations by suggesting in the submission that you're not a composer because you've created a wonderful composition here.,"And in the patch there is a comment saying ""I attempt a chord.."", but in reality the author succeeded in creating that chord!",This is a great work and the author should be proud of it- there is no need to be timid about this effort.,The patch looked well organized and presentable.,I thought the sound was decent and could tell there was a nice amount of effort put in it.,I was recommend dolling it up a little more next time.,"Your idea and concept are very simple, but the sounds that are chosen are funny to me for some odd reason.",It sounds like the George Lopez theme song without the trumpets and if it was slowed down a bit.,"I think the actual idea of how you wanted to present this is different from what a lot of other people decided to do and the sound is a little bit low on this DC Lab computer for some reason, but it's still a good patch.","Everything with the technical analysis is fine, even though your sound is coming out without one of those buttons to stop and play sounds, which I didn't expect.","When they described that they had the ""least amount of musical talent"", I thought hey I can't be that bad.",The patch looks very nicely displayed and is concise.,It shows the notes playing on a piano and acts as a nice visual.,"The patch worked perfectly, it played all the notes in the right order and repeated the sequence.",It didn't really sound like a recognizable song but it could easily be turned into a new creation.,"I thought it was also funny how the person wrote Warning, I have no musical talent.","Don't worry, it worked fine and I thought it was nice and simple tune.",This patch is great.,There is a lot going on and it sounds great.,The layout is cool and they used commands that I wasn't familiar with.,"If anything they could organize the patch a little differently, but overall I really liked what they did.","This piece is very simple, and just plays a short repetitive tune.","The work is activated with a single toggle, then plays through its various other components.","It's a simple concept, and didn't really spark any specific feelings.","I think this work may have come out a little better with a bit more effort, and a longer melody.",The patch plays a simple melody on a loop.,"That is just the beginning though, because there are some really cool objects in it.",Plot~ and Picslider objects added some fun to looking at and playing with this patch.,"The picslider made the patch interactive, because you could click and drag the button and that would change the sound.",I loved the Plot~ because it bounced to the music and was visually appealing.,The patch is super cool but the electronic sound and short repetition wasn't too pleasant to listen to.,This patch is easy to understand and produces a simple melody.,It uses multiple bleeps and two counters to create a simple 8-note melody.,"Technically, the patch uses things that are not necessary, such as showing numbers multiple times and using + operators instead of a message of the specific number that was desired.","The 'select' has 3.14 and 10, which are never received from the counter.","The second counter goes backwards yet never hits 1, 3.14, or 8, as the select has in it.","While it doesn't affect the way the patch works, removing those things would make it easier to understand.","Conceptually, the patch seems like it demonstrates knowledge of how a sequencer works yet doesn't create sounds that are great to hear.",I would suggest removing unnecessary elements and trying to make the bleeps into a basic recognizable song.,Very nice.,"It is clean looking, sounding and works right out of the box.",I also like your creative use of more complex objects.,Harmonically  it sounds great.,One thing though is that with how well and neat your patch is I bet you could have had more amorphous interesting melody.,"First of all, it took me a second to realize you sent more than the actual project required.","I got a max patch for four things, which is going above and beyond but it's totally cool.","For the max patch I think I am supposed to critique, it was simple and intricate.",There were no visual or technical problems with how your project worked.,"I just want to know why you sent the ""make a bleep"" patch and the other two.","Still, your patch is very intricate and simple, which is a good thing.","It made me feel anger because I thought I was going to have to critique four different patches, but at the end of the day, I'm very chill.","My only suggestion is to not have a folder of work, only what is needed.",This was a cool little melody.,"However, the last four notes don't play for some reason.","Besides that, great job!",Maybe try adding in chords or using rests!,I like your work.,Not too hard but not too easy.,I don't know if you know but the last five buttons aren't connected so no sound is made.,It was very clean and basic and I feel like you successfully made a sequencer.,One suggestion would be to go a little out of your comfort zone and try something a little harder than a few keys.,"But overall, good work.",Well done!,"This looks like it was a bit complex to set up, but it works like a charm.","Everything is labeled, your layout is fantastic, and its fully interactive.",I dont feel like I have anything I could suggest to you to make it better than it already is.,"I told someone else this, but If you had gone throw and changed the colors of everything that might have been cool.",A little overwhelming to look at upon first glance but I love the idea.,There are three sound files that play according to which gate the user decides to open.,Each sound represents a drum sound which are clearly labeled on the sides.,There is also a clear set of instructions that allows for ease of use.,It works when a gate is switched on and the beat repeats but can be changed accordingly based on what gate the user opens or leaves closed.,The author created a neat basis of beats that could be easily changed up from a simple click.,"It was fun, trying to think I had a good sense of rhythm but it was definitely exciting to jam out to after.",For an improvement I think it would be neat to add a few more sounds even though it was totally awesome with just three.,"At first glance I said ""oh Sh&* but It was interesting.",Im not sure if I did it correctly but It seemed like a lot of work for the minimal sounds I actually heard.,But it did work correctly and it was pretty cool.,It took some time to change the sounds to make it unique but it works great and is pretty interesting.,One suggestion is possibly trying something to randomly change which sounds go where to add to the variety of choices.,Great work.,Great attempt at a Roland Tr-909!,This patch sequences three types of drum sounds.,It uses gates as a user interface to turn on or off a sound within the sequence.,A master volume slider and levelmeters objects made it easier to use.,This is a very successful patch and is super fun to play with.,I have played with it on two separate days.,Both times I had trouble making sure all the sound files were available for the patch to use.,There was file inside a file and once I loaded all the sounds from both files and the patch to the desktop the patch worked flawlessly.,Even with the directions it took a while to get it to work.,This would be a great one for presentation mode because it would visually simplify the user interface.,"The patch plays a blues tune using a two-part sequencer, with each part moving at a different speed and containing a different number of steps.","Everything visually looks like what we did in class, but for some reason I'm having trouble manipulating it correctly such that I can hear both sequences instead of only the 64-step one; I played with the patch quite a bit but couldn't figure out what was wrong.","I'm interested conceptually in the idea of representing a blues standard through Max, but I wish I was able to see the full effect.","The author might improve the work by thoroughly testing the patch to avoid such issues, and perhaps by organizing it in a more visually accessible way (I had to scroll quite a bit horizontally before I could see what was going on).",This patch is really complicated and doesn't have to have so many elements that are on it.,The buttons are not needed in your patch so it would have been easier for you to just connect the selectors to the messages directly.,The patch is also very big and could have been shrunk down.,If you were to use it again it would be really hard to copy.,I really like the song I think it has a very interesting tempo with all the pauses but its suppose to be blues so I get why it's the way it is.,I think your patch could also be more fun for the user if you were to change anything about it I would add some visual elements or some ways for the user to interact with it.,"Especially with blues music, a lot of it is improvised so you could add some other tones to it that the user could press to play.","My initial reaction was that this patch was massive, not necessarily a bad thing though, it was evident it probably took a lot of tweaking to get right.",There were a substantial amount of notes.,The patch uses two different metronomes and a series of notes to create a blues song.,"The song sounded pretty cool, it was enjoyable to listen to and by the author's description I could tell it probably took a while to perfect.",I did notice some unnecessary parts.,"The blank message boxes used to create rests/breaks weren't exactly needed, those select outputs could have just been left empty, which would have helped with the size of the patch as well.","I think you would have done so if you knew though, as it probably would have saved you some extra work!",This patch is very big.,The sequencer didn't fit the screen.,"However, it still retained the clean and functional look.","When the sequencer is activated, a really jazzy melody begins to play.",This patch did a great job utilizing the tools to make a cool melody.,Your patch huge width wise.,The sounds kind of sounded like something from an old game which i liked.,I don't know if its possible but I would suggest somehow making it so everything is visible on the screen or at least most of it at a time.,"Overall of your patch looks great and complicated, The template that you picked is so catchy, however you might need to do more research on how to embed the URL link into Max.",My suggestion to you is that you might add the cougar sound(like the original version) into your project by adding .wav file instead of playing just midi note.,This will make your project so much more interesting in the way that you want.,"I believed that you put a lot of effort in to this work because your patch is well crafted, however there is a part that it seems not working to me, which is the """"Extra piece"" otherwise everything is awesome.",I like the melody in this patch it has good pacing and nice soothing sound.,I like the complexity of this patch and how well it is put together.,This is a good patch overall and I like it.,Very very nice patch.,This patch was very organized.,The patch looked complicated but all I had to do is toggle it on and it worked flawlessly.,The melody was amazing as was the entire work.,I have nothing but praise for this work.,"If I was forced I would ask for graphics or visuals, but I didn't feel like I needed it.",So it looks like there's three different sequencers that make up different parts of the song.,Everything is laid out very cleanly.,I particularly like the left most one; it's actually really aesthetically pleasing to look at.,I think this setup was a smart way of making sure all those notes didn't look too clustered.,"It works very simply, which I like.","The metronome sets off three different sequencers, and that's basically it.","It's very simple technically, although I'm sure it took a lot of skill to actually organize all of those notes together.",I really liked the song created it was very pleasing to listen to.,"Also, I checked out the song (definitely putting that on my iPod) and I think they did a really good job of matching the song.",I can't imagine doing that without actual sheet music or midi notes (major kudos!).,The only suggestion I have for improving the work is that you could put in some synth sounds if you use the techniques we learned from the last assignment along with this.,"One of the other assignments I critiqued used a sequencer to set off sound files in a specific order to create a beat, so you could try and do that to achieve the same sound as the original song if you wanted.",I think this was supposed to be Surfin' USA.,The patch was too big to fit in the Max window on my laptop.,There wasn't a toggle so it just started playing as soon as it was opened.,"I'm not sure what the blue blinking dots were for, but I can appreciate trying to give the patch a little sprucing up.",Gotta love the Beach Boys!,The Led visualization was a nice touch and the patch was simple enough to understand.,"Although, I feel like the tempo was a bit off.","The patch has an unusual structure to it in that much of the commands and objects are quite miniaturized and on the sides while these giant bright blue buttons, acting as a sensor that detects sound and lights up, are front-and-center.","It's highly unusual, but a fun idea, especially given the upbeat tempo and message of the Beach Boys' music, before Pet Sounds, that is.","The structure of the mechanics of the patch are very routine, there being an interval command, though, that slightly changes the tune every pass-through, which makes it interesting to listen to time-after-time.","The Beach Boys are a classic staple of music, and Surfin' USA was and is the epitome of the surfing scene so I quite enjoy listening to it repeatedly.",For improvement I suggest reorganizing the patch hierarchy to make the actual technical aspect more understandable.,This patch looked so crazy and complicated and I am astounded!,The sound was very nice and creative and I would recommend it to a friend.,I think they could have advanced a little more only because I see more to be accomplished.,This is my favorite patch so far.,"Although on the bigger side, this patch offers a visual accompaniment to the carefully thought out melody that the sequencer plays.",The added visual aspect lets me get a better feel for the melody and is a great addition.,"After clicking download, the patch did not load as a typical patch would.","Instead of showing the presentation, it went straight to the coding of it.",I am not sure if this was because of my computer or because of the way it was saved.,"However, I can tell by the coding that work was indeed put into it!","It's a shame that it didn't show up, I'm a huge fan of the song Earth Angel, and since the author is a pianist, I'm sure it was done very well!","But since I wasn't able to see it, I can't say these things for sure.",It won't open correctly.,Maybe before submitting assignment try to close and open it so see if it works.,Im jsut getting a bunch of Hooplah.,Well despite your challenges you did the required work for the patch so that's good.,It was very simple in its function and that is not a bad thing.,I can clearly see you tried to make a somewhat discernible melody using this labyrinthine software.,My only suggestion would be to practice with Max a bit more.,It seems like foreign calligraphy right now but once it clicks with you how it works it will be much easier to use.,"That being said, Max will never stop being frustrating in general, as I have learned.","When I click ""Download"" I am taken to a page containing endless text computer script.","I'm not sure why this is happening, as all 4 of the other patches I just critiqued downloaded fine without any problems.","Not sure if this is a technical error or some kind of error made by the creator of this patch, but unfortunately I have nothing to critique.",Here is a screen shot of what I am seeing: http://i62.tinypic.com/an1lbs.jpg,Oh no!,"I can't see this one either, when I press download I get redirected to a block of code.","Sorry, especially since you had to redo everything :(",The Ramones are AWESOME!,"The sequencer very well designed and was not too complicated to understand, which left me feeling relieved from the other complicated designs I've critiqued.",The tune was just as enjoyable as the sequencer and it did do justice towards the original song.,"The time it took to create the sequencer must have been awhile, which shows through the original composition of the sequencer.","To be honest, I don't know what I could say to the author to improve his/her work on this project besides adding moving graphics.",This is an introductory course yet others have shown to have more experience patching on the Max program.,The author is clearly ahead of the game with the project and it ROCKS!,"The notes seem to be all correct in accordance to the song, and the patch works quite well.","The only thing is, maybe slow the tempo down a tiny bit.",Since you do have so many notes playing the side structure was a good idea.,The button flashes directed and visually represented the song.,The song is recognizable through the patch.,I also commend you for attaching all the connections.,This patcher appeared more complicated than it really was.,I liked the beat and it was very catchy.,I could see how making it was a challenge but it was very entertaining.,I have been recommending for everyone to make it colorful and stuff of that sort just to appeal to the eye more.,Really dug the melody and bass.,"I can see you took your time with this patch finding the right notes, which I know is a pain in the ass.",Technically it was very simple.,"I had fun switching one part off and back on, changing the variation of both sequences playing together, and it worked.",My only suggestion would be maybe incorporating midi and finding other sounds.,"Thats not really much of a suggestion, I'm just required to make a suggestion.",I liked it!,"The patch used the make a bleep with a grouping of selects, counters, and metros.","What was unique for me about this patch, was the dual melodies that could be played either together or separately without there seeming to be something lacking.",The author even enabled the user to quite easily hear each side separately or together.,"In the future it isn't necessary to make duplicate metros and counters, instead make a single master time system, and the use send and receives to move timing data to the selects.","Then to make one side play and not the other, add gates between the receive and the select with a button hooked to the left inlet.","With this setup you can hit the button to allow numbers to pass to the select, and you never have to worry about one side being out of sync with the other.","When I opened it, I was quite surprised at how massive it was, leading to how the creator put a lot of work into this.","Technically, The lead part seems to work fine but I will say that the rhythm could barely be heard and had to listen closely to even hear it.","The author created a song utilizing two seperate selects for rhythm and command, and it felt alright to use.","I suggest to raise the volume on the rhythm section a little bit, but it's pretty good overall!","As the description says, there is both a lead and rhythm section that the user can activate one or the other or both at the same time.",Both pieces of music are enjoyable for listening on a loop and sound great together.,It's nice to have the ability to play with the tempo of each by having the number object attached to the metronome.,This allows the user to experience with different speeds to adjust how it sounds.,"I've had it playing in the background for about 10 minutes now and haven't gotten annoyed at all, good job.","Based off of the description that was written for this project, I was able to determine that this patch would have two different sections for a piece of music to be played, a lead part and a rhythm part.",Both of these parts would be able to be played separately or collectively.,The description ensures this by naming both sides and by saying that the users can do this on their own.,The way that this patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the top toggle.,"The toggle then activates the two lower toggles, the two buttons and two metro objects which then activate the counters, which range from 1-32 on each side.",The counters are attached to two different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1-32.,These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a numbered message attached to each input.,"The number was attached to each input, is then attached to a number object, which shows what number it received.","This object is then attached to a subpatch that plays different midi notes based off of the individual number message it receives, it makes a sound.","Then, to toggle the sound on and off, there is an ezdac object attached to each side.",The author created a simple song with the use of 2 different set of notes.,"Their sequencer branched out into two different sides, one representing the lead, the other representing the rhythm.","By including toggles on both sides as well as a top toggle, it is possible to listen to these part together or to just the listen lead or  to just the rhythm just as the description said would be possible.",Going over this patch was very easy and convenient due to the separate toggles on each side and due to the labeling of what was the lead and the rhythm that was on each side.,My only concrete suggestion is that I believe that it would be possible for the author to omit the number object that is attached to the metro objects on both sides.,"It does not really serve a purpose and when I was just trying it out to affect the patch, it turned the notes into a jumble of sounds, rather than a song.",The patch is very interesting to look at.,It almost looks like a wreaking ball and acts as the visual element to the song it plays.,It is also looks simple to create and not very complicated.,I think the creator made a good choice to use the chorus of the song.,It would have been interesting to hear the full song with the background music and all.,The author created a computerized version of a  popular song with both a visually appealing element and musically adept part.,From first glance it looks really clean and seems to work correctly.,It was a cool way to make the song and it was very easy to tell how it worked.,You successfully made a song from a sequencer and that was the assignment so great work.,One suggestion would be to add something to make some of the notes last longer to give the song some depth.,"But overall, great work.",This sequencer is very elaborate and looks very overwhelming at first.,"Though, upon clicking play I can see that other then changing tempo you really didn't do all to much extra stuff.","It works nicely, I'm not very knowledgable of the actual song but I'm sure it sounds about like that.","I think with the synthesizer piano visible in this, it could have been really cool to see the keys play the song.",Terrible song choice.,You could've chosen a better song.,"Out of all the songs in the world, you chose wrecking ball by Miley Citrus?",I must say I'm disappointed actually.,"This patch made me feel agitated, which is unfortunate since I was having a great day before listening to this song.",Now my whole day is just going to go into a downward spiral from hear on out.,It's stuck in my head now.,"Anyways, I think you did a good job with this.",I like how you added pauses in the sequencer to match up how the actual song is.,It was very easy to understand due to labeling.,My suggestion would be to choose a better song.,"A single toggle runs to three metro/counter/select combinations, which each lead to a make_a_beep.","The sound certainly has a spooky vibe to it, with sort of a eerie music box feel.",The only change I would make would be to clean up the patch some - there's no need to have three separate metro/counter/selects if all the metros are the same.,"Based solely off of the description that this project has, it is very clear on what the goal is, which is to make ""music"" using internal synthesizers.",There was no possible way for me to misunderstand what the author was trying to accomplish.,The way that this patch works is that it is activated by clicking on the top toggle.,"The toggle then activates the three metro objects and three buttons which then activate the counters, which range from 1-8 on all three sides.","The counters are attached to three different sets of select objects which are numbered from 1-8, that are also attached to 8 buttons on each branch.",These objects then obtain the information they need in order to play whatever note with the use of a numbered message attached to each input.,"The number was attached to each input, is then attached to a number object, which shows what number it received.","This object is then attached to a subpatch that plays different midi notes based off of the individual number message it receives, it makes a sound.","Then, to toggle the sound on and off, there is an ezdac object attached to all three sides.",The author successfully created a sequencer that played a tune that was inspired by the Halloween season.,The way that notes were arranged really made it sound like it was a haunting tune.,The three different branches that this patch had served as a way to make chords happen.,The patch itself is really clean and I can hardly see any faults with it.,My only concrete suggestion would be that if it's possible would you be able to possibly condense your three branches down to two by maybe placing the two numbered messages on a single input?,I love the simplicity of the design.,It doesn't look over the top and does exactly what the assignment asked you to do.,The patch uses a metro object to output numbers into a make a bleep object.,The patch makes me feel that Max isn't something to be afraid of and that anyone could use it to make something useful or entertaining.,I would suggest adding user input into the patch so that anyone could make their own loop.,"Description:This piece produces a dissonant piece that reminds the viewer of the music from ""Nightmare Before Christmas"".","Technical Analysis:When the user selects a toggle, the piece activates 3 separate metros which count in sections of 8 beats.","If a note is to be played, a select sends a message containing the note value to the ""make a bleep"" sub patch which produces sine wave.","Conceptual analysis:I don't know if this was intentional, but the way that the buttons blink with that intense yellow along with the music reminds me of the halloween decorations that have little blinking light for eyes.","Anyway, this patch does a very efficient job a creating a haunting piece of music for the user.","It's really easy to see how everything is ordered, and how the patch works.","Suggestion:This is just a wild and crazy thing, but I noticed that the whole point of the piece is creating a dissonant, creepy, tune- and the notes seem to group together.","So, one suggestion might be that, instead of listing each individual message for the for the note, you could elevate this piece by connecting them to a random number generator instead.","That way, not only does this piece become something that is new and exciting every time someone uses is, it plays to the strengths of using a computer to make music- like the fact that computers can generate their own note values.",This patch is really neat.,The sequencer plays a very catchy song that is really popular now.,They nailed the melody and it sounds exactly like the real song.,They even added a vocal to make the sequencer more advanced.,Overall this patch is very functional but also adds a fun side.,Visually and functionally this piece was very strong.,"This was the only piece that I saw that incorporated the mini key board, which gives it a heightened level visually.",I also really liked that you incorporate notes and a voice over wave file creating the additional layers.,"Technically the piece is very intricate, with the two different counter sets 1-34, yet the simplification by the clean design make it easy for the user to follow, as well as engaging.","Another element that I really like was the meter, it was a nice added visual component to the piece.",I think you put a lot of time and effort into this work and it shows.,One way to elevate it might be to create another metro box on the second counter layer and change the speed slightly to create a different effect.,Great work!,"The patch is easy to read and understand, I like the use of the ""open"" function for the spoken word, and how the notes play only after the words have spoken.","The timing is on point, and everything flows well together, overall I think this patch is very solid and the use of spoken word makes it interesting.",When I first heard this song I started laughing.,"Something about hearing a song like ""Talk Dirty To Me"" in a Max patch is just funny.",The patch works as in was intended to do and the layout is clean.,This was probably my favorite one out of the 5 I reviewed because it was hilarious!,Good job.,Hah!,Awesome job for completing the assignment with an easy to follow max patch and creative output.,I appreciate incorporating another sample in time with your midi sequencer.,I appreciate the integrated use of metro and counter and it really seems you've got the know-how to program a sequencer in Max.,If you had more time to factor in beat samples or create synthesizers I would be anxious to see what you come up with.,Great patch!,"At first glance, it looked simple enough.","I didn't know what a few of the objects were but once I started using it, I figured it all out.",Other than that it was fairly straightforward.,It has a nice melody to it so it made it feel relaxing.,"I didn't know what a few of the objects were in the bottom left, but they were really cool.","Overall, I liked the simplicity of it with some cool objects.",Great Job!,"Very colorful.Nice patch, and it works.",Good job making a simple sequencer and adding the background for a nice effect.,Maybe try adding in chords or using rests!,"This patch was a simple, yet very well done 10 note sequencer.","It features two different meters to measure sound, which was very fun to see.",It also had a background color changer to help make it seem customizable to the audience/user.,"Overall, the patch was a clear and precise way to sequence the music files, and the little spices added in made it a lot more fun.","My only suggestion for an improvement would just be to possibly make a more recognizable melody for the sequence to play, but that's just being nitpicky.","Other than that, it's great!","Patch was very easy to read, looks very similar to class example, although the colors and various meters added make it aesthetically pleasing.","Over the patch ran but the sounds were a bit boring, but I enjoyed the customizable options you added.",Maybe making the bleeps go to a certain song would make this patch a bit better.,"Description:This piece plays a simple 8 note tune when activated.","Technical Analysis:Then the user selects the toggle, it begins a metro with only 150 ms delay between beats.",That activates a sub patch which contains a 1 to 8 counter.,Then a select object sends a message containing the note value back to the main patch which generates a saw wave.,"Conceptual analysis:The inclusion of a saw rather than a sine wave, with its gritty, mechanical tone color, plays well with the fact that the notes in the tune seems really ""techno"" and ""computer-y"".","Suggestion:In Tinapple's ""make a bleep"" patch, he included a message and a line object with the sine wave object that decays the tone over the length of the note.","That would be useful in this patch because when the metro is turned off, it continues to produce a tone.","It's hard to tell if you were going to a specific tune or just random notes, but if it was just random, you could include a random number generator that would greatly expand the scope of the project.",Not much work appeared to be put into this patch.,It played a little jingle but nothing to impressive.,I would recommend playing around with the keys more and trying to have fun with it.,Very organized and easy to look at.,The sound is pretty obnoxious but it has that deadmau5 electro ring to it.,Very amusing.,Maybe on eway to improve would be making it so that the user can choose what notes to be played in order to create a more personal melody.,"This piece is more abstract than others, due to use of a sawtooth oscillator.","The work is activated by a toggle, then just goes through a simple sequencer like we went over in class, but is put through the oscillator just before final output.","I like how it turned out, and it sort of reminded me of an old arcade game fight scene.","Overall I thought it was good, but I wouldn't have minded if it were a slightly longer melody.","This patch built on the make a bleep setup, playing an 8 note loop.","After the make a bleep section, a sawtooth wave generator was added to the patch.","Unfortunately the saw~ made the sound a little bit abrasive and even after the toggle was off, I was getting sawtooth noise from the patch.",In the future play around with the attributes of the object more rather than just dropping it into the patch.,MSP has many synthesizer objects and all of them can do great things when you take the time to play with them.,This looks fantastic.,If only It sounded as good.,"I think it is compelling how you set this up though because you can potentiall create melody, counter melody, harmony, and even triads.",I was not able to get any audio out of it though.,"Also speaking from experience on 808/909 style step sequencers having a simple ""on-off"" versus a potentiometer style nob creates easier playability.",So the patch looked cool when I opened it up.,I don't often see more than the basic patch so I was excited to see one so different...until I couldn't figure out what to do.,"I turned it on and it beeped, the same note over and over again on three lines and I found that I could raise the volume, change the notes and make it go faster, but it didn't really follow the instructions.","It was supposed to play a song, not leave the user to figure out how to make the song.",In the end it just confused me.,"I would suggest at least giving some instructions on what exactly to do because even after playing around with it for a while, I couldn't really do anything with it.",Still a cool design though.,Excellent layout.,"Perfect organization, nice colors, clear and big font, and nice volume bars and note selecting knobs placed throughout the patch.","The patch works by turning it ""on,"" which then begins a piano note going at a steady tempo.","The tempe bar at the top controls the beats per minute, there are three sustain bars included each with their own volume bar, and three rows of sixteen knobs to control what notes are being played.",I absolutely love the fact that this is an interactive piece in which the user is improvising a piece of music right on the spot.,It's genuinely fun to play around with and spend time tweaking to see what type of chord progression comes out of it all.,"I have no advice to offer on how to improve this, you've made a wonderful patch.","Though, if there was a way to select between different midi instruments, that'd make it even more awesome.",I was stunning by the cool graphic in the presentation mode.,"I think that the overall of your patch looks really great, but the sequence of the note is quite simple.",I think it would be great if make a default note sequence more like a musical sequence.,The adjustable on your project is the strongest point.,"I believed that you put a lot of effort in to this work because your patch is well crafted, but it would be better if you can add more creativity to make it more vibrant.",Visually this is the best patch I have seen.,It is very pleasing to the eye.,Maybe one way to improve this would be to put in different keys so its not just the same note repeating over and over again.,The last couple sentences of your theory are worded confusingly.,You should add more of the equations to the theory.,Could do another study or two.,In your conclusion I would talk more about the drag forces and motion than the code itself.,"I would recommend getting a little deeper with your study and results, just by manipulating the factors in the drag equation and explaining the way the code behaves under these changes.","There a few minor grammatical errors I noticed in the conclusion so I would go ahead and review that, but overall the report was easy to read and fairly well done.","Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations(a) All equations used in this project were properly described within the theory of the report.",(b) Program runs correctly and displays numbers within the ranges of expected values.,"(c) Code runs, but is not explicitly verified within the body of the report.",More emphasis could be placed on why the output makes sense for given input values.,(d) Only the initial conditions chosen by the user were inputted into the code.,Further calculations and results were not described within the report.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study(a) The introduction clearly introduces the topic of the assignment and what concept this code is trying to convey.","It is concise and short, but provides all necessary information for an uninformed reader to follow.","(b) Since there was very little varying of parameters, the study possessed little depth and significance.","The code runs correctly, but what does the output say about the study?",About drag force?,(c) No new information is given from further computations.,"(d) Conclusion vaguely covers scientific study, but does not go into detail.","Quality of the report(a) The users English is sufficient, and the read runs very smoothly and effortlessly.",Transitions are easy to distinguish and the topics flow together throughout the entire report.,"(b) Though I could reproduce the calculations shown, there are very little to warrant any great understanding from simply doing so.","(c) The conclusion is somewhat vague, but conveys the major concepts and connects with the report.",(d) The report looks professional.,"Graphs and tables are not simply thrown together, descriptions are placed in appropriate places, and sections flow from one to the next.",Technical Accuracy-Your report is very accurate and you do a good job of explaining applications of the project.,"I think you could add some other explanation to your theory though... maybe explain a little about the constants rho, A and C, what they mean and they affect the problem( just to add some depth to the theory part).",Insight and Depth- You did a good job in your study documenting different scenarios and how they would affect the problem.,i like how you used a baseball as an example to help the reader visualize a real world example that can be related to.,Your figures were well labeled.You might think about making them smaller though and writing explanations around them to make it look somewhat like a text book ( the way you did it isn't wrong its really just a personal preference thing).,Your report read well and i think its overall appearance was very professional.,"you may want to change some ""Technical Phrasing"" they said we should write as if the reader doesn't know very much about dynamics.",great job there really isnt  much that you need to change to be ready for final submission,"Overall, I really like the  presentation of the report.",It is well organized and with the presentation of the report it makes it look very professional.,"In the introduction, it is very thorough and gives good insight to what the project is all about.",I like how you incorporated drag force into your project because it makes it unique and shows you actually know what your talking about in your report.,"Also, with the incorporation of including how engineers will/can use this in real world situations make it an interesting read.","In the theory, I like how you defined all the variables you used in the report which makes it very clear on what is going on in the report.",It is very easy to follow what is going on for the reader.,"In the study and results section, I like how you explain what each graph is displaying with and without drag.","Also, having labeled the graphs correctly helps the reader understand the physics behind the report.","In the conclusion, I feel you can expand a little as you can tie in the whole project and apply it to engineering.","In the appendix, I ran the code and it works.",Great report and keep up the good work!,Your report is great!,I would just tell you that you could use the word equation instead of pictures for your equations.,"Also, you should have submitted a pdf copy of your work and not the doc one.",Great job.,"You had stellar code verification, however you might want to turn a case or two that you had in there into studies.",You didn't have a study section at all you just said that the code works.,There were a couple proofreading errors that you could fix also.,Your code is working and is verified in your report.,Your report looks good and is fairly easy to read through.,The only thing i would say is to label your equations differently.,"Your tables looks good with ""figure #"" underneath but you should label your equations with it on the side.",It might just make it look nicer to read.,Nicely done!,"Was easy to read and very good construction,",Make sure you uploaded your project as a PDF and not a word document.,"Your theory and code verification was very well done however your study and results is where you should discuss the difference scenarios tested using the code, the results they yielded and the assumptions or conclusions made from these results.",Nice presentation of the report.,Great idea on talking about the applications immediately in the paper.,It draws the reader's attention and shows the relevance immediately on what the research is about.,"The presentation of equations 3, 4, and 5 is a little confusing, though.",You don't explain exactly what or why the equation becomes an approximation.,"Also, equation 5 is not the result of adding equations 3 and 4.","I'm not sure if that was the intention of that sentence, but it is a little misleading as far as that and how beta is involved.","Under ""Study and Result"" explain the difference between the explicit and implicit versions of the code and why one may be more preferable over the other.","Also, maybe delve a little more into what happens when changing parameter values.",What happens to the motion?,The prompt asks for a study of terminal velocity as well.,See if you can manipulate the parameters to show how that occurs with this model you've created.,"Code is not complete, I am unable to run it and test it.",I like the report and all of its sections.,I like how you tied in real world examples to show how the code could be useful in real world applications.,one thing I would say to work on would be the study and results.,it didn't seem like you did much for that and it could be added to and improved.,other than that it was an excellent paper with a solid conclusion to bring it all together,Fancy.,"Nice way of formatting, very unique.",I suggest wording a few sentences differently so it doesn't sound so repetitive.,"Your study and results section could definitely use more detail and information, include graphs and pictures of what your MATLAB code generated.",Overall good job.,Theory: Your theory is correct.,"Could not verify the code, seems like you didn't copy the entire code into the appendix.","Interest and Insight: The report was extremely short, and a little redundant.",I would add more info into the theory and the study.,"Quality: Again, just add a bit more depth to it, and it will be a pretty good report.",Code verification is also needed.,I really like the introduction and cover page!,"However your ""Study and Results"" could be elaborated a bit more (add graph, explained them, etc...).",Good job overall!,"This was a very nice report, very clear and easy to understand what the CP was about.",Some minors things that could be changed are the sections make the section title bold just so it is easier to distinguish them.,"Also add some other trials to see what happens the projectile motion, maybe even add the wind!","Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computationsGreat introduction and theory.",The conclusion is a little short.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the studyThe comparison from implicit to explicit code is a good study, consider adding in one or two more such as increasing the 'c' value, or adding wind to the code.","Quality of the reportThe report is well written and easy to read.",Very Good work.,you showed that you understood the problem and the study as well.,The Introduction to the report is missing some more introductory information about whatŠ—Ès to be done.,You can talk about the concept of drag acting on a body moving through a fluid and how itŠ—Ès proportional to the velocity and opposite of the direction of motion.,"Also, you can explain a little about how NewtonŠ—Ès Method is utilized in the project.",The Theory Section of the report explains with great detail the equations and definitions of the forces that are being studied.,All variables are explained in order to clear any doubts.,"Well explained, and stated too.",The Study and Results section have good graphical analysis as well as explanation of the modifications and their outcomes.,"Each graph, including the Command Window, is explained in detail.",The incorporation of NewtonŠ—Ès Method in the code and project is also well stated and explained.,"I would try a few more modifications and either put the data and graphs in the report, or talk about the outcomes from these.",The Conclusion was also well stated.,The topics of the project were explained again.,The results were explained as well as the incorporation of different densities and their outcomes.,"I would talk just a bit about the physical outcomes different densities, initial velocities, mass, etc.",have on the trajectory of the projectile.,Excellent report that could use some more modification and variation to the Study and Results section.,"At one point you say ""And, knowing the rules of derivation in dynamics, velocity and acceleration can be found known to be:"" and go on to give velocity and position equations.Your drag force equation, as written, is incorrectly twice throughout the paper.","The 1/2 is in front and the rest of the variables should be in the numerator, not denominator.",Near the end you seem to get into the idea of terminal velocity but don't elaborate on it.,"Discuss what it means, how it is achieved, and see if you can model it through your code.",Does the code give you values consistent with the definition of terminal velocity.,Try to do this by messing with the parameters of the drag force equation.,"At some point in your report, try to mention how this is relevant, outside of class, to real world engineering problems.","Good start but more evaluation in the Study & Results section, go into depth about the code's capacities other than what was already given.",The code needs to be verified as well and a few grammar/spelling errors.,"Technical accuracy: Theory and program are correct.","However, the code is not verified.",There should be a special part in the report for code verification.,"he computations are done in a good way, and they are easy to follow.","Interest and Insight:Study is not completely described in the study and result part.",There should be more in depth and details in that part.,"Quality of Report: All the report parts are there, which is good.","All of them look good except the study and result part, as I mentioned before.",It needs more depth and details about the explicit and the implicit parts.,"I don't see any evidence for the study, although results are listed with some explanations.","Also, if you add more details in the theory part, it will look even better.","Conclusion connects to the goal of the project, and presentation style is good.",it is a very well written paper that gets right to the point.,the only thing that I might change is the introduction a little.,I like the background you provided but maybe getting to the point of the project right away and then explaining it to them.,other than that  like your study and how every thing is explained and well detailed great paper.,"introduction;Your introduction seems good and completed.","Theory;in your theory, you provide most of the needed equations follow it by a good explanation as well as your study and result.","conclusion;has good summarize of the whole report.","Indeed, your report looks good, and  just don't forget to add the implicit part","TheoryHave your equations on the own line, center them and add a captionoverall good report",Technical Accuracy-Intro looks good.,"you need to add some explanation to your theory (but i think you know that)2.",Interest & Depth- you have your code working which is good.,now you need to go a little more in depth with your study.,EX.,what happens when you change the drag coefficient?,what happens if you change the mass?,Could you add a cross wind?,"These are just some ideas 3.",Appearance- needs some rearranging.,( but i think you already know that,The person put his name on the paper instead of Posting ID.,Introduction and theory parts covered well.,The report has graphs and that verifies the code is working.,"In study and results part, graphs need to be labeled.",The file is not in .pdf form.,On the right track.,All the equations in your Theory should be used just add some description so others know what variables mean what..,The graphs are accurate.,     This computing project report does not has an enough points to cover it.,"Also, the theory is correct of explanation by using equations, but it missing a lot of writing stuff.","I think this report is very easy for other to understand and follow the progress, but it still need to edit some points and to add some points to get a good project.","In all, this report is good on detailed explanation.",(4 out of 5),"- theory needs actual discussion of what the equations mean and how they relate to each other- grammatical errors- in intro, it isn't force of friction that acts on the particle, it's drag force- plots need to be centered and have captions- results need to be discussed, not just shown- study and conclusion need to be done (but you acknowledged that so just reminding you)","Technical accuracy: Theory and program are correct.","Computations are done very well, but there is no evidence for code verification.","Interest and Insight:Study is described very well.","The study and result part looks good, too.",Good job!,"Quality of Report: The report is done completely expect the code verification part.",All the parts are completed.,"Conclusion is connected to the goal of this project, which is good.",The presentation style is good.,Wonderful Job in your lab report.,you showed very good understanding of the problem and understood how to work the problem out.,His report is organized.,And his codes are almost complete.,And theory is applied.And the graphs are related to codes,The table of contents is (IMO) unnecessary.,The graphs were bigger than required and each section seemed way too spaced out.,Reducing size of graphs and spaces would save on a lot of room and make the report half the length.,On the way to a strong report but read back through for sentence fluidity.,"The introduction, theory, study and results, and the conclusion were all very well organized.","The theory introduced and explained all the equations of Newton's Method, the drag forces, and the explicit approximation and implicit section for the MATLAB program.",The report was very easy to follow.,His report is right formate.,And his code has some errors need to fix.,And he didnt apply the theory.,And his code related to graphs,I would suggest adding a title page.,To make it look more professional I suggest not having big bold red letters for each section.,Great Theory section!,"Also excellent Study and results, very thorough.","Good job, I think you did good in this project.",Your introduction explained this project very well.,"However, in your theory part, I think you should not just list the formulas but also need to explain how these formulas work in this project.","For you study and results part, you should compare the difference between the original and the new one, so you need to give us the original figures for this computer project.","Your conclusion part is good, you tell us what you learned from this project.","- in theory section, explain how equations relate to each other and how they are relevant to the project- some grammatical errors in the way things are phrased, such as the first paragraph of the results section- needs more varying plots in the results section, and the numerical data needs to be discussed- conclusion doesn't apply project to greater goals of dynamics- make sure equations are centered- i'm not sure if the red font is the best choice for the headings",You need to add some information and explain how you got the graphs.,Also show and explain how the methods are involved,"Throughout your report, I think it is a good idea not to use first person.","In your introduction paragraph, you shouldn't really bring about any first person.","In your theory, you definitely need to explain your equations more.",What each value is in the drag force equation and also what the direction vector is or represents.,I think your also missing a couple of equations including the new position and velocity equations.,The study and results section would be easier to understand if you described the variables in the drag force equation.,Then the reader could understand how these initial condition values react when inputted in the drag force equation.,Your study and results section is a little weak in the aspect that the values the graphs produced are not discussed.,Specifically the speed vs time graph.,Explain why the particle loses velocity up until about 5 seconds and than the velocity spikes again.,"In your second graph, explain why the Z coordinate is the only one that isn't changing linearly.","And in the third, discuss what the difference is between the projected dots and the projected graph.",You are also missing a conclusion all together.,Avoid the use of first person.,"Also, the theory should provide much more detail about where the equations came from.","For example, we utilized the equation of motion which was derived from the free-body diagram, this must be shown.",All of the variables that appear in the equations must also be explained.,The code needs to be tested as well.,How do you know that the code is actually plotting the correct trajectory?,Try some test cases.,"Project looks great, I would add a little more in the theory section along with the equations.",Maybe also if you have some time add some more graphs using different values for drag just to have some data to compare to.,your introduction is a little all over the place and can be rewritten in order to make a little more sense and also be more fluent.also the theory could use a little work.,you probably know you have to add to that.,your study results looks good and very well defined and illustrated.,you don't have a conclusion which you probably also already know.,Basic skeleton of the report is there.,More elaboration is all report topics and a little bit more exploration and you're golden.,Don't forget code verification.,Aside from adding more to your study and results section everything else flows well and there are no grammatical issues.,If you need guidance as to what to include refer back to our course notes and the CP guidelines.,Be sure to include what your discoveries were.,"Theory is correct (3 pts)Code is not

part.",You should put all the formulas not just some of them.,"For you study and results part, you need to explain what are these figures, and compare the difference between the original and new.","study and results should be reviewedcode verification","Good as overall, try to change the font or the size to make a difference between the title and the paragraphs ( in some of them, you used the same).",Graph's taking up a lot of page real-estate.,Consider resizing to fit better.,Don't forget code verification!,More exploration of the implicit (more so than explicit) would make report stronger.,"I believe the information is all there, Id recommend making sure everything is clear in your theory and the result section.","I also would not put a screen shot of what MATLAB returned when you ran the code, put the data in a nice neat organized table.","Also change the conclusion it was nice summing up what the results portrayed, just reiterate what you said in the introduction.",The flow of this report was okay.,Revise your report for grammatical errors.,The %% in your descriptions can be removed and the figures can be easily reformatted in the report.,Add in more details on how you are using these equations in your code as well as reformatting your figures will help a lot.,"Good start but there could be more in-depth discussion, the graphs need to be explained other than what is already known as well and code verification.","There were also a few grammar/spelling errors and try to avoid using ""my"" in the report, it should be written in 3rd person.",Good job comparing the explicit and implicit too!,I suggest adding the course title and the professors names on the title page.,Theory section is very clear and thorough.,Great explanations of the figures in the study and results section.,You need to add more in study and results about the actual project itself.,May want to speak of terminal velocity in your report.,"Theory documents the equations implemented well.",I would recommend adding a caption to your equations.,"Study and result add captions to your images over all a good report",Starting out your introduction is quite strong.,"However, you are missing the explanation of the implicit version of this code we were supposed to incorporate.",Basically the only thing we need to know is that the explicit version includes the drag force and gravity and the implicit only has gravity acting on the particle.,"In this problem, what is the fluid density and where does the value for this variable in the drag force equation come from.",I would also discuss in your theory why you have to add the direction vector to the drag force equation.,"Simply stating that a force has a magnitude, being the Fd equation, and direction, m equation.","Other than these, your theory is very strong and includes majority of the aspects.","In your study and results sections under the physical property, explain a little bit as to where you picked these initial conditions that you implemented into your code.","Also for your figure 2 explanation, it seems that you made a little bit of a typo with the difference between the dotted graph and the red graph.",I think you meant to say one is with drag force incorporated and one is not.,Your figure 3 i think you need to explain a little bit more what is examined from this particular graph.,Why the velocity slows down at the the beginning until the peak and than rapidly speeds back up.,"In your conclusion, explain a little bit as to why doing hand calculations would take quite a bit longer rather than doing them through matlab.","Your report should have two codes on the Appendix, one for the explicit version and another one for the implicit one.","However, it has just one code, which is the first one.","Also, you could explore more your code.",Try different values for your variables and see what is happening.,I liked the way that you made your report.,"It is really good, but you can make it even better than that.","introduction;Your introduction seems good and completed.","Theory;in your

more than just looking at velocity graphs.,Make sure your graphs are not blocking any equations or word as well.,"Other than adding a little more detail, your report is organized and easy to follow.",The report is well written.,"It has each of the 5 sections (intro, theory, etc.)",and it is organized and explains each of the equations used to solve and complete the Projectile Computer

it.,The only thing I would say is don't forget to have a cover page and to put the appendix in a separate starting page.,This was a nice report the only thing  I would recommend is add different trials of different drags and such maybe even wind.,"Also just double check some grammar in the report, very minor.",Good construction on the information.,Was clear and easy to read.,this is  a very well done paper.,the study and results is amazing and you do a very good job of explaining and showing every thing you did for this project.,the only thing I might work would be your introduction.,it just seemed off to me.,I am not sure exactly.,how ever if you like it I would keep.,other than that every thing else was very well done and explained.,A+ paper!,That was a great report.,It was laid out very well and the flow was great.,I liked the way you studied real scenarios in your study and result because it made it easier to understand what was being shown in the figures.,Your theory was very good as was your code verification.,the only thing you could do to make enhance this report is test another scenario maybe using a different projectile.,"After reading your report overall I feel that it is well organized, in-depth and looks professional.","In the introduction, it gives good insight to what the report is about.",I feel you can expand on it more to make it more through.,"Also, indent the first line of each paragraph.","In the theory section, I like how you stated all the equations and variables with each figure making it very easy to follow what is going on the report.","In the study and results section, it is very interesting how you used a ""bowling shot in the air"" because it makes your report unique from all the other reports in the class.","In addition, all the figures and tables are labeled correctly which makes it easy to follow for the reader.","Also, having the code verification means you know what you are talking about.","In the conclusion, it gives great insight to what you talking about and really ties in what happened in the report.","Also, with the outside sources it shows that you put great effort into the project.","In the appendix, both codes ran great.",Other reports I have looked at did not display explicit from implicit.,GREAT JOB!,"     Actually in this computing project report contains good explanation,but it seems to me that it doesn't cover the whole point of the project.","However, the theory is correct and in specific explanation by using equations.",I think this report is little bit hard to understand and follow the progress of the author.,"In all, this report is very good on detailed explanation.",(3 out of 5),In your conclusion you talked about examples of projectile motion in sports.,In order to enhance your report I suggest you alter your code to simulate one or more of these examples and talk about each one in a little more detail.,That way you can really dig into the computing project and start to better understand the code and projectiles under the influence of drag.,Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations: The introduction part is complete and correct and the Theory part is correct and it is presented in Microsoft equation editor and it provides all the equation that is needed in this part with description of each equation.,Program is correct and it runs with correct numbers.,"Code is not verified , you have to verified the code by describing what the code about and how can you use it.",The report is complete and it has all the part that is needed in a report and it's well written report but I think you need to write more in the study and result section.,Quality of the report: The quality of the report is good and the ideas are well developed and connected with each other but you need to add more in the study part and explain what you did in the code.,    This Computing program report contains good explanation of the goal for doing the project.,Also the theory is correct and in specific explanation.,One thing that this report can be improved is showing up the implicit graph and explicit graph separately.,The code is verified and the computations are done.,The good point is that this report contains the 3D projectile graph.,Good movie in your study and results.,Don't forget to add the acceleration with the drag equation in your theory part under the newton's second law f=ma.,"For figure 1, try to make it more clear to see the dashed curve (without drag) from the actual curve (with drag) so it's apparent that the drag force has a big effect on the particle.",The Introduction was well stated and very relevant to the topic of investigation in the project.,I would only add some information or explanation about the use of NewtonŠ—Ès Method in the project.,The Theory Section of the report explains with great detail the equations and definitions of the forces that are being studied.,I would add an explanation for the variables used in these.,The Study and Results section have good graphical analysis as well as explanation of the data that they are showing.,I would definitely add some more modifications to the code and explore different outcomes.,"You could either include the graphs on the report, or just explain the modifications you made along with their outcomes.",The Conclusion was also well stated.,The topics of the project were explained again.,The results were explained as well their outcomes.,This report need lots of work to do.,"the report lacks 3 major parts of the report: the conclusion, study, and the plots.",Make sure those problems are addressed and fixed for better grading.,My first observation is that your paper could use more context in all categories.,"Introduction is well started, however I would add more to it to make it a better read and for more depth.",The theory section has the correct formatting for the equations and looks like all the required equations are there.,I would add more context to the theory section and also change the format this section to flow better.,"Obviously remember to fill in the two other sections of Study and Results, and conclusion.","I like your introduction and theory, just make sure you implement them and convert word to pdf.",First upload it as a pdf as directions have instructed.,"As you probably know the report is not finished and from the looks of your code, it seems you just uploaded the m.files that were on Bb and did not add in the required information for it to work.",You have some work to do but what you have for the body of the paper meaning theory and intro is fine.,You don't have anywhere close to a complete report.,I wouldn't do the color coding equation thing it doesn't look professional.,"Hello, A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use: -I would suggest rereading your report and looking through it for typos.",#NAME?,#NAME?,"Record your tables, and anything interesting you see happening.","- Consider the questions on page 4, of the CP2.",There are some interesting questions that are fairly easy to write about in the report.,#NAME?,p.s.,"Everything you wrote seemed to be correct (at least to me), you just need check grammar, and consider the above suggestions.","Solid report, however.","- some spelling errors- switches between present tense and past tense- try and center plots and tables- align the text better so there aren't items separated from each other, such as the figure captions on one page, but their respective images on the next- possibly discuss why implicit is better or worse than explicit","First off Great Report ( all of my critiques are just going to be nit-picky)1.",Technical Accuracy- You did a great job explaining the purpose behind the experiment and how we are going to use matlab to analyze the problem.,I think you should explain some more about the force equation and what the constants mean.,The reports are supposed to be written so that a reader with little knowledge of dynamics/MATLAB can understand.,"(like i said nit-picky) 2.",Interest & Depth- you did a good job comparing the explicit and implicit codes.,i think you could use some more depth on the implicit code though.,ie what if the coefficient of friction changes (water vs air)?,what happens if the mass of the object is changed?,what if there is a cross wind.,( adding wind sounds hard to do in the code but its actually not to bad).,Appearance- your report looks very professional and all of your figures are easy to read and understand.,Get rid of the objective section and add to it to the intro.,Great intro!,May want to label each equation with their own respective equation number.,Go more into detail in study and results about the actual project!,Add a code verification!,Great tables in the study in results,Good job.,You absolute did the introduction part well.,"For your theory part, It make me understand the theory very well and you list the formulas that we need to write down.","In your study and results part, you compare the difference between the original and the new one.",I think it is a good way to learn this project.,Your conclusion part tell us what we learned from this project and I think you did all good for this computer project.,"Theory: Correct, code looks good.",Lacking a code verification though.,"Interest and Insight: Your description was pretty good, maybe add a little bit more to it though.",Didn't really talk about making changes to code to see what would happen.,"Quality: Good report, missing a study and results section though.",I would also add figures of the graphs to add more to the report.,"For your report, you did not actually complete the report.","For the Introduction and Theory, your information is relevant but it is mostly recited directly from Computing Project 1 Notes.","Try going into more than just Trapezoidal Rule, there's more going on for sure with this computing project.","The Introduction needs to have a description of the study and the theory needs to actually be explained for the position, velocity, acceleration equations.","You have no evidence in your Study and Results, definitely include your results if you're code is running properly.","Then try to explain what you're results show, i.e.",MATLAB calculations and graph.,Adding some more images would be beneficial for you.,"Make sure not to forget about the Code Verification, Depth and Significance, and the other categories we are supposed to write about.",You need to update your conclusion once you have actually updated and completed your report.,"You also should have two codes, one for the explicit code and another for the implicit code.",The codes should involve drag and terminal velocity as well.,Don't be afraid to explore and explain the computing project!,"introduction;Your introduction seems good and completed.","Theory;need some workstudy and result you really need to start your this part because its the most important part on the reportalso you need to include the graphs conclusion;has good summarize of the whole report.",Theory is good but at the end tell what you are trying to do.,No study and results.,Conclusion is very well thought out.,Your code looks like it needs some work.,Make sure you have all of your variables defined in your matlab code.,Recheck your equations to see if you typed them in correct.,Make sure you verify that your code works and try to give a detailed explanation of the things your testing.,"Such as more drag or higher initial velocity, etc.",He put his name on the paper instead of Posting ID.,Introduction and theory parts covered with detail.,The graphs verify that the code is working.,"In study and results part, graphs need to be labeled.","But the graphs are not labeled with Fig1, Fig2 etc...",The report is in the pdf format.,Your theory was good.,"However make sure you discuss your findings in study and results, also verify that your code is working correctly.","Hello, A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use: -You have a great introduction, and theory.","You could add some detail to the study and results, along with the conclusion section.",#NAME?,#NAME?,#NAME?,#NAME?,"Record your tables, and anything interesting you see happening.","- Consider the questions on page 4, of the CP2.",There are some interesting questions that are fairly easy to write about in the report.,#NAME?,p.s.,"Everything you wrote seemed to be correct (at least to me), you just consider the above suggestions.",Good report.,"Technical accuracy: Introduction needs more details about the goal's of the project.","Theory is correct, but it is missing the equation derivation.","Program is correct, but the there was no evidence of code verification in the report.","Computations are done, which is good.","Interest and Insight:There was no evidence of a study in the study and result part, although the results ""graphs"" are included.",Try to add info about the study with more details and depth.,No new observations are done.,"Quality of Report: The report is completed.","All parts of the report are done expect the study in the study and results part, and the code verification.","Since the introduction is missing details about the project, try to make the conclusion connected to what you are gonna add in the intro.",Good presentation style.," The introduction of this computing program report is very specific, and the theory of this report is correct.",The author of this report demonstrated graphs of both without drag and after drag.,"However, it is better to show up implicit and explicit graphs in the study and result part.",This report is good to read and easy to following.,Good report though.,"Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations(a) All equations used in this project were properly described within the theory of the report.",(b) Program runs correctly and displays numbers within the ranges of expected values.,(c) Verification of code is clear and examples make sense.,(d) Computations are done correctly and displayed in a way that makes sense.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study(a) The introduction clearly introduces the topic of the assignment and what concept this code is trying to convey.","It is concise and short, but provides all necessary information for an uninformed reader to follow.",(b) Study goes into good detail and describes how the motion of the particle would change.,Effect of drag force is evident in later computations.,(c) More computations could be done to increase insight into the concept.,(d) No direct conclusion is discussed.,"Quality of the report(a) The users English is sufficient, and the read runs very smoothly and effortlessly.",Transitions are easy to distinguish and the topics flow together throughout the entire report.,"(b) Reproduced calculations would turn out the same, and the outlined assignment is described.",(c) No conclusion written.,(d) The report looks somewhat professional.,Inclusion of equations throughout text make it difficult to read.,I would advise writing these out by themselves or separating slightly run text for visual appeal and a smoother read.,"It could be better, but it missing lots of stuff.",There were lots of missing figures.,"However, you're going good on the project.","Theory: Theory is correct, code looks good as well.",Interest and Insight: Did a good job of modeling it after something.,"Quality: I would recommend putting all the equations on there own lines, and not just in the paragraph, it would make it look a lot better.",Make sure to label the figures as well.,Don't forget that conclusion as well.,"Overall, nice report.","To be nitpicky, v^2 is not the speed, v would be the velocity and the norm of v would be the speed.","For equation 3, explain where the c variables arises from the accumulation of the other variables in the drag force equation.",Perhaps explain what the trapezoidal rule is doing and what the vn+1 and xn+1 equations are for.,"To further elaborate, the velocity would be fastest anywhere along the horizontal line at the same level of the muzzle of the cannon (1 meter above the ground).","For instance, it would be at the same magnitude of velocity on the cannon's descent at the same vertical height from the ground as the muzzle it was shot out of.","Also, speed of sound is roughly 340m/s, not 600m/s.",Explain the difference between explicit and implicit versions of the code.,Explain terminal velocity as it relates to this project and attempt to model it using your code.,"Technical accuracy:The theory and program are correct.",There is no evidence for the code verification.,Computations are done.,"Interest and Insight:The introduction needs more details about the goal of this project.",Try to add a brief explanation on the process of this project.,"Study is described well, and the results are labeled properly, but some of the graphs are missing.","There is no evidence for the conclusion, try to make it connected to the introduction when you add it.",There is no evidence for the new observation part.,"Quality of Report:The report is completed, except the code verification part.",Good presentation style of the report.,"Again, the conclusion is missing, but try to make it connected to the introduction after you add details on it, too.",Good job!,The document should be double spaced.,Equations and figures looked great.,"Like you said, there should be more test cases and results provided.","All is well, but more detail on the study and results (however, the creator recognized this).",The graphs are well explained and the theory is well explained.,"The introduction, too, is well explained.",May want to add a title page to make it more professional looking.,Great explanation of the equations in the theory section.,You may want to add much more to the study and results about the actual project and how it is used.,Maybe try and add a real world application in your conclusion.,"Theory is correct (3 pts)Code is not verified.","(0 pts)Computations are not completely done (1 pt)so in the first part (4

read (2 pts) the report is not complete (1 pts)Conclusions connect to study: (2 pts)Presentation style (2 pts)so the total of all parts 14 out of 36You need to add the missing parts",I think that the first paragraph of your introduction is very good.,The first paragraph of your theory however seems like it should be placed in your introduction paragraph.,Explain a little why you can lump the constants in the drag force equation together and can't combine the velocity squared.,Also you need to explain where the m equation comes from and why it needs to be implemented into it.,For example why a force has a magnitude and velocity.,You mention explicit and implicit versions of the code in the theory section.,"However, you never really describe what these are or what the difference between them.","To the reader, they would not really understand these terms without a short definition or explanation of each.",You need to real think your figure 1 description.,"There are always forces acting upon the particle even if there is not drag force acting on it, such as gravity.",You give the graphs that were produced from the matlab code but you don't explain these graphs at all.,To the reader these graphs don't mean anything without an explanation of what they may be looking at.,Your conclusion needs a little rewriting as well.,Theory and study/results could be stronger.,Graphs were on the large side.,Remember code verification.,"After reading your report, overall it looks very professional and is well organized.","In the introduction, I feel that it is a little short and you can expand more on the project itself.","In the theory section, you should define all the variables in the equation so that the reader knows what you are talking about.","In the study and results section, you should label all of your graphs under it such as ""Fig.1 with an explanation"".","Also, expand on what the project is all about and what you did.","In the conclusion section, you can tie in what you did in the project and how it applies to engineering.","In the appendix, the code worked but you are suppose to have an implicit and explicit code.",Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations: The introduction part is complete and correct and the Theory part is correct and it is presented in Microsoft equation editor but you need to add more equations  in this part .,Program is correct and it runs with correct numbers.,"Code is not verified , you have to describe what your code about and explain what you did in the code.The report is complete and it has all the part that is needed in a report and it's well written report but you need to write more in the study part.",Quality of the report: The quality of the report is excellent and the ideas are well developed and connected with each other but you must work more in your report and add some equations in the theory part and complete the study and result part.,"The project is just starting, most of the key objectives of this computing project are missing.",I would suggest reviewing the requirements for computing projects and reading the cp2 objectives.,Good luck!,You have everything you need in the paper but a little more describtion about the equations is needed and the graphs should be alittle more in depth.,Conclustion and intro are good.,Somewhere in your paper try to explain how Newton's Method obtains more accurate results in the implicit version than without it in the explicit version.,"The conclusion seems a little scattered, jumping from thought to thought.",Explain why the implicit version is more efficient than the explicit version.,Dig into the exploratory side of the project and see how different values for the parameters affect the final outcome.,The prompt also asks for an exploration of terminal velocity and how it relates to this project.,See if you can model a terminal velocity situation in your code.,Small detail: try making the pictures of the results smaller so they don't take up so much room.,Overall good start to the report.,I would add more context to each section and move the graphs and figures into the appendix.,"The introduction is a good start, could use more content on what the code actually does.","The theory section has the correct notations for equations, however more context in writing to help describe how all the equations come together.",The study and results section needs a little work.,I would move the graphs to the appendix and have a reference in the text to them.,Needs more context on what the figures are actually showing.,"Conclusion overall is good, maybe clean up the wording a little bit.",First add a title page to make it look more professional.,Remove the numbering for each individual section.,Organize the theory section a little more for aesthetic purposes.,Don't put screenshots of the command window in the project.,May want to shrink the size of the graphs a little bit.,Add a real world application in the conclusion section.,"After reading over the report, overall, it looks great because it is well organized which makes it look very professional.",I feel you should double space the report so it is easier to read.,"In the introduction section, I like how you stated the report without coping it directly from the CP.","In the theory section, you should define the variables stated in the equations so that it is easy to follow for the reader.",I also like how you displayed explicit from implicit in this section of the report.,It looks like your theory section incorporated the study and results section too.,You should break it into two different sections.,"In the conclusion section, you should tie into what the report was all about and also tie into how it is applied to engineering in the real world.",When I ran the code it worked.,"Overall, great report just fix the little things stated above.","Hello, A few suggestions for you, that you may or may not want to use: -I would suggest that you add a bit more to your conclusion.","Add in what you noticed, and took away from the study and results portion.","- Consider the questions on page 4, of the CP2.","There are some interesting questions that are fairly easy to write about in the report (I know you covered a few, but add that in your conclusion as well).",p.s.,"The report had everything correct, and was a wonderful report.",I had to scrounge for ideas and suggestions...,Easily a great report.,"Great introduction, and theory.","Nothing was lacking, except for maybe adding a bit to the conclusion.","Theory is correct (3 pts)Code is not verified.","(0 pts)Computations are not completely done (1 pt)so in the first part (4 pts)Description of study.","(3 pt)Depth and significance (2 pt)New observations (1 pt)Scientific competence.","(2 pt)so the second

out of 36You need to add the missing parts",Extremely thorough report.,Great work.,"The only change I might recommend is when looking at the initial implicit code find a way to graph the projectile with drag and one without drag, for comparison purposes.","For your report, I really like how complete you have your report.","I like your Introduction, but try going into more depth into the Description of the Study.","For your Theory, you have very detailed information which explains everything that you need to know about this Computing Project.","You have some commentary, but mostly graphs in your Study and Results.",Definitely include more commentary in this section on your results since it seems your code is running properly.,"Make sure not to forget about the Code Verification, Depth and Significance, and the other categories we are supposed to write about.",You need to update your Conclusion once you have updated your report.,"You also should have two codes, one for the explicit code and another for the implicit code which it looks like you do.","The codes should involve not only drag, but terminal velocity as well.",Don't be afraid to explore and explain the computing project!,It looks like your code is giving you good data.,Your essay looks like it is mainly graphs in the middle.,"Try to organize your paper better, maybe making graphs smaller but still easy to read.",Also give more explanation of what is going on in your results.,For example you just say the arrival time varies for different velocities.,Actually explain to us what is happening and why it is.,Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations: The introduction part is complete and correct and the Theory part is correct and it is presented in Microsoft equation editor and it provides all the equation that is needed in this part with description of each equation.,Program is correct and it runs with correct numbers.,Code is verified and it gives us a complete description about the code and how it is about computing correctly.,The report is complete and it has all the part that is needed in a report and it's well written report which explains every part in details.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study: The study part of this report is complete and the student describe the topic very well.",Quality of the report: The quality of the report is excellent and the ideas are well developed and connected with each other and it is very organized report.,I like your incorporation of the figures to help explain the theory and code.,I would be sure to include a real world example in your conclusion.,Your drag looks pretty intense in the figure.,Did you alter it?,That's perfect.,It is well explained and organized.,"You not only explored the final velocity using MATLAB, but also verified it by hand.",Great job.,Absolutely outstanding report!,There is not a single thing I would change or edit in this report.,Excellent flow and concise steps that proved and showed the reason for this report.,This report is elegant and the explanation of theory is correct and specific.,The code worked great on Matlab and the data that the author used has explicitly contrast.,So the result is clear and easy to understand.,"Also, this report contains detailed summery on conclusion.",Great job.,This report looked professional and it read well.,"A few hiccups in the writing but that is minor, just re-read the report.",Maybe add some other trials of drag and or wind with drag.,Also add the data that was given when the program ran.,"Other than those few things, good job!",The Introduction was well stated and very relevant to the topic of investigation in the project.,I wouldnŠ—Èt change it.,The Theory Section of the report explains with great detail the equations and definitions of the forces that are being studied.,All variables are explained in order to clear any doubts.,"Also, the code is verified by the graph of Speed vs. Time.","Well explained, and stated too.",The Study and Results section have good graphical analysis as well as explanation of the modifications and their outcomes.,"Each graph, including the Command Window, is explained in detail.",The incorporation of NewtonŠ—Ès Method in the code and project is also well stated and explained.,"I would try a few more modifications and either put the data and graphs in the report, or talk about the outcomes from these.",The Conclusion was also well stated.,The topics of the project were explained again.,The results were explained as well as the incorporation of different densities and their outcomes.,"Overall, a very good report that could use just a little more variation on the Study and Results section.",His report is right formate.,And his code has some errors need to fix.,And he didnt apply the theory.,And his code related to graphs,The report is well written and organized.,"The report describes the study, it has depth and significance and new observations.",The code is verified in the report and the conclusion connects to study.,The presentation style is good and is a good read.,The theory of your report is very detailed and informative.,"Figure 1, the speed vs. time graph and the accompanying text should be in the study and results section of the report, not the theory.","For the study and results, you should show the other graphs that MATLAB output when you run your code and explain them; why the graphs behave the way they do and what you could do to change them.",Obviously your final report needs a conclusion as well.,"Overall the study just needs more depth and a conclusion, but the report is easy to read and interesting.",He put his posting id on the paper instead of name.,Introduction and theory parts covered with detail.,The graphs verify that the code is working and the person labeled the graphs with the proper name.,"graphs are not labeled with Fig1, Fig2 etc...",He did detailed report and explained the formulas.,Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations: The introduction part is complete and correct and the Theory part is correct and it is presented in Microsoft equation editor and it provides all the equation that is needed in this part with description of each equation.,Program is correct and it runs with correct numbers.,Code is verified and it gives us a complete description about the code and how it is about computing correctly.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study: The study part of this report is not complete and the student  should add figures and describe the topic and the result .",Quality of the report: The quality of the report is excellent and the ideas are well developed and connected with each other and it is very organized report.The report need more work.,you should add more in the study and result part and add figures.,Very nice table you got there in your study and results.,Make sure to complete your study and results with graphs and what you have learned from them.,Also try to add more of that and from the introduction onto your conclusion.,The report looks great and the introduction and theory are well presented and explained.,"However, improved formatting as well as neater and cleaner looks would be nice to see.",Study and results shows little explanation but data.,Would be nice to see the data more widely explained in detail.,Your introduction and theory are both very good.,However your study and results is a little bit slim.,I suggest adding some figures and various scenarios into that section so that the reader can visualize the projectiles position as well as better understand what you are studying and discussing in your conclusion.,The theory and introduction are both very detailed and well-written.,The only comment I have for the the study and results is that it needs to go deeper...manipulate the drag equation and discuss why the relationships behave the way they do.,"The way you presented the data with the table was pretty cool, just do that with a few more trials with varying factors to add depth to your report, which will verify your code.",More depth into what the code does in the introduction.,Missing a few equations in the theory section and could also benefit from more context about how the codes interact with each other.,More detail and depth would drastically help this section.,The study and results section needs to be more elaborated on.,Move the figures into the appendix and annotate them in-text.,Go into more detail about about the difference between the two different situations.,Conclusion could use more depth.,    The cover page made this report unique and elegant.,Also the arrangement on the whole structure of this report is clear and neat.,This report is easy to read and understand.,"In addition, the code is verified and the theory of the report is correct.",The improvement can be that showing up the implicit and explicit  result separately.,"Also, showing the original obits without drag and after drag could make the study part better.",The Introduction to the report is missing some more introductory information about whatŠ—Ès to be done.,You can talk about the concept of drag acting on a body moving through a fluid and how itŠ—Ès proportional to the velocity and opposite of the direction of motion.,"The Theory section indeed has the equations used throughout the project, but again, you can elaborate on the use of these and how they might affect the outcome of the trajectory of the particle.","Also, you can explain how NewtonŠ—Ès Method will be used in the code.",The Study and Result have good graphical analysis and an ok explanation.,"I encourage you to further explain these graphs, as well as either demonstrate changes to the code or talk about possibilities of outcomes from changes done to the code.","The Conclusion is missing, but should be pretty straightforward once the editing is done.","Overall, itŠ—Ès a decent report with room for improvements as stated.",The report is easy to read and has a good presentation style.,More explanation could be possibly added in the Theory section.,"How Newton's Method will be needed, and what each of the variables represent for the equations presented in the section.","It is a good report so far, I feel more explaining could be added.",Project is well done!,Looks neat and the formatting is nice.,"The theory and study and results, however, could use some work.","Not enough detail done, and the graphs aren't explained to the fullest extent besides what they are.","Also, don't forget to include code verification and understanding.",Report incomplete.,More detail for sure should be included in the code and the theory should be completed.,The formatting needs serious work as well as the study and results explanations.,Can't critique an incomplete report.,"Code looks great, though.",Add a title page to your report.,Add the theory section and revise and complete the other sections.,The flow of this report was lackluster and needs revising and more details about what you are doing.,"Reformat the figures to a more easy flow and consistency, also include a figure label and brief description of what the figure is.",This report needs a lot more revisions and additions.,"must have better theory, study results and conclusion.","code verificationnew observations.",The report didn't look finish.,Look on BB to follow on what the guidelines are for the reports before submitting your final project.,"Lots of information are missing, when you get those in your project will look good.",Your last figure needs to be fixed.,"The only real critique I have for this report is the lack of the conclusion, which needs to be included in the final draft.","The theory, intro, and study were all very well-written and detailed.","One thing you could do would be to discuss the speed vs. time of the particle/object, which can be outputted by MATLAB and included in your report.","The introduction could have a little more clarity on the project, but overall is a fine report.",This project reflects on a little bit more than just projectile motion.,"This project involves a little bit of dynamics, including motion and energy.","What kind of drag coefficient are we dealing with in this project, like fluid density or such.","However, in your theory  section you said that the drag force relates to the velocity.","It is a little different than that, the drag force actually has its own velocity and opposes the velocity of the particle.",Where did the equation for c come from and how did you know that you could just put all of the constants into this equation and leave out the velocity part.,"You also left out the part that this force of drag is a vector, which means that it has a magnitude, the equation of drag force, and also a direction which is the part you are missing.",You need to describe the direction of this force as opposing the direction of the velocity.,"In your study and results, you have strong descriptions of the 3D trajectory graphs, however, you are missing a couple of graphs including the speed vs time grand the the position vs time graph as well.",You are also missing your conclusion.,The explicit version of your code is missed.,"You report is really good, but you can make it better.",You could write more about what you explored on your code.,I particularly like short reports.,Some people write long reports and do not say anything important.,"Also, you could centralize the figure which you inserted in your report.",Good job.,you did a very good job on the study and results.,you explained and showed what you got and what it means.,I would work on your introduction a little.,maybe start by saying what the problem is and then say how great it really is instead of talking about something the read has no idea about yet.,also you didn't write a conclusion but all that was done was very well explained and written.,"Theory documents the equations implemented wellAdd a caption to your  equationsoverall well written and good report",Your code looks like it works based on the figures and data you have provided in the report.,I think it was good how you explained what you were doing to the code and what effects it had before you gave a table or graph showing the data.,It is easy to read what you were doing and then seeing the outcome.,"Good Job, best one I read so far and I felt like I understood the whole concept a lot better just by reading this.","The code needs to be verified with some type of side calculations though, 17 pages seems a little too long and you could condense some of the graphs onto one page but overall - good job so far!",missing code verification.,"theory could be more objective, but it's great.",study and results and new observations are great too.,"Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computationsVery good2.","Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the studyGreat3.","Quality of the reportVery good, perhaps mention the drag force in the introduction, otherwise good job!",The theory part of your paper could use a little more detail as to what each equation represents.,"I also suggest expanding your theory and results section, you can refer to the CP guidelines to see what other areas of interest you can include.","Try to avoid copying and pasting the actual MATLAB coding into your paragraphs, perhaps take screen shots or attempt to word your logic behind the line of code you are describing.",How did adding an additional force help you understand this concept?,Maybe you could go into more detail on that discovery.,"introduction;Your introduction needs little work and not to be that short Theory;in your theory, you provide some of the needed equations but it needs some  explanation as well as your study and result.",i think you have to work more on your report to be completed,"The report reads ok, Its very short and there is no code verification.",Should probably re-word some sentences in the conclusion.,"Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations(a) All equations used in this project were properly described within the theory of the report.",(b) Program runs correctly and displays numbers within the ranges of expected values.,"(c) Code runs, but is not explicitly verified within the body of the report.",More emphasis could be placed on why the output makes sense for given input values.,(d) The addition of another Force vector in the downwards direction gave further insight to the nature of this problem.,It provided an interesting graph displaying how the particle would behave under this new constant force.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study(a) The introduction is very short, and does not adequately describe the concept implemented in this assignment.","(b) Since there was very little varying of parameters, the study possessed little depth and significance.","The code runs correctly, but what does the output say about the study?",About drag force?,"(c) The additional force vector shows some more insight into the behavior of the particle under varying conditions, but with so few other computations, comparisons are difficult.","(d) Conclusion vaguely covers scientific study, but goes into very little detail about particle dynamics.",More could be added to show a greater understanding of the topic and what it implies for future use.,"Quality of the report(a) The users English is sufficient, and the read runs very smoothly and effortlessly.","Graphs are kind of just thrown together as the outputs, without any real description to what they represent.","(b) The calculations used in the report could be reproduced, and the report covered the major

material.",(d) Report layout could be improved upon.,"Graphs could be ordered and labeled more cleanly, more info added to what the study and results section says.",The implicit version of your code is missed.,I think you could spend more time working on your project to understand it better and explore it a little bit more.,It seems that you do not explored it.,"Also, I think that the

simplify them.,and maybe explain more about the drag force function (what do the variables mean?).,Interest & Depth- what you covered in your study looks good.however I think you could add some more depth to your study like what happens when the drag coefficient is changed?,If the mass of the object were changed how would that affect the study?,"If you had two different objects (each with a different mass), what happens if one has a horizontal velocity and the other doesn't?",do they hit the ground at the same time?,the answer is easy but does your code prove it?,Appearance- Some of

perspective.,He explained the variables in the beginning part of the report and it makes the reader understand what is going on with the calculation.,He did detailed report and explained the formulas.,Document should be double spaced.I would explain each line of your equations and explain where they came from.,"Technical Accuracy- Your report is pretty accurate, i think you need to add some explanation in your theory rather than just putting a list of equations.","Interest & Depth- Looks like you are going into a good amount of depth just don't forget to add the part 3 & 4 to your study as you indicated and you should be fine3.",Appearance- Over all your report looks okay.,i think you should consider putting it into a template so it will look a little more

how they are relevant to the report.,"Overall the report is okay, it needs some more additions and revisions; mostly in the grammatical areas.",The introductory paragraph is hard to follow.,Drag force is not necessarily opposite to gravity.,It is only opposing the direction of the velocity of the front-facing section of the object.,"The trapezoidal rule is a way of estimating an integration, which helps us calculate what we need for all the time steps in this project.",I believe instead of motion you mean to say position.,Explore terminal velocity a little bit more.,What does it mean for an object to be in terminal velocity?,How can you model it in your code?,Try to illustrate real world examples of engineering problems where this model can be useful.,"Theory add in more of the equations used for the MATLAB code and describe themStudy and resultsOn your equations I recommend to center them and add a caption",Good report.,"few things I'd like to point, you did a good job in the theory part, however you did not show any equations that are used the Matlab code.","make sure you add and derive the needed equations, those can be found in the course notes.","It was a good report, but just try to explain more to what you the project was about other than the explicit and implicit versions.",Like what happens if the drag force is big or smaller?,Other than that it was good :),"Good start, however try to take your code further than that by changing the variables and experiment with different situation.","By doing so, you will be able to compare different cases of terminal velocity.",Otherwise good job!,"Descent into and theory, I would just follow the format instructed on blackboard; by that I mean properly show functions and label them correctly along with the figures.",The study and results part is off to a good start but be sure to follow the criteria and requirements for CP2 along with more in depth study.,After more addition to the study and results section then you should add more to the conclusion.,"Your report is off to a good start, just put in more time to finish it completely.","In the introduction section, I feel you can expand more on what the project is all about.",It seems a little short.,"In the theory section, you should define all the variables stated in the equations.","In the study and results section, you should properly label you graphs and give an explanation of what each graph is doing such as ""Fig.1 (explanation)"".","In the conclusion section, you should tie into what we did in the report to how it relates to engineering in the real world.","Also, you should label your appendix.",The code worked.,"Overall good report, go back and fix the things stated above.",Good start but there needs to be more in depth evaluation of the subject and code verification as well.,The report had what looked like good data.,"In the revision, I would add a few variations to the drag coefficient for some different data sets as a comparison, but overall the report is well written.",    This computing report is very professional.,The introduction is very specific and and the explanation is detailed.,"The theory of this CP is correct, and the code is verified.",The study part is the best between these five reports.,And the conclusion is very good summary of the study.,This is by far the best paper Ive critiqued.,"Editing of the paper is professionally done, equations are properly annotated in correct format, and the report is very in depth and shows more than what is required.","Some advice I would have is that since each section is so in depth, be careful not to overlap information that was previously stated in another section.",Also maybe in some areas move the figures into the appendix and annotate them in-text.,Report looks great So far so i'll just give review on ways to improve.,"Intro and theory of complete and correctStudy and results are great but it would be better to include graphs of effects of wind and other forces acting on object (new observations)In general it is a good readgreat description of studyMain suggestion i would give is to arrange your equations in the format described in blackboard notes for cp's.",Also figures should be labeled the way the notes suggest.,"Great start, good luck!","Very good report, should get high marks.",The best report of my 5.,Good job.,Your introduction part tell us what we need to do in this project and what should learn from this project.,"In your theory part, you listed the formulas that we need to use for this project and explained what these formulas is.","However, in your study and results part, not just give us the figure you get from the original code, but also give us what you changed the code and the new figures.",     This computing project report contains good explanation of the goal for doing the project.,"Also, the theory is correct and in specific explanation by using equations.",This report has very detailed writing about the explicit solution and implicit solution.,I think this report is very easy for other to understand and follow the progress of the author.,"In all, this report is very good on detailed explanation.",(1 out of 5),"Good quality show, a bit more explanation would be helpful.",I am would incorporate more experimentation in the conclusion.,I would recommend a real world example as well.,Overall a great report.,Um!!,good intro?,"lol Obviously keep working on the project and follow the guidelines in CP2Good luck!!",Wouldn't it be nice if this is all we had to type up for in a report!,"Obviously there is much still to work on so I will save comments other than to just go by the ""computing project guidlines"" for how to structure your report.",Your project was not finished and completed.,All you had was a an appendix.,Please go to BB and look at what is needed for your reports.,The person did the introduction part and after that put his/her code in tho the appendix part.,"No Theory part of the reportNo study and results part of the reportNo Conclusion part of the report",Your introduction and your appendix are well made.,It looks like you just ran out of time but you seem to know what to do!,"For what you have, it's written well and easily readable.","However, as I'm sure you know, you need a study and conclusion of your report, as well as a verification of your code.",There's not really much else to say than to provide a detailed study and conclusion before you submit your final.,"Missing study and results etc etc, , just need to finish it.","Include a title page, a section on the study and results, as well as a conclusion.",The report that you have so far flows well but is not complete.,Add in those two sections and add more detail on the use of the equations and figures produced by or in matlab.,The figures produced do not look correct so there is a possible bug in your code.,Check with one of  the teachers or aids for the code.,Overall the report is okay but not complete!,"Finish the study and results section as well as verifying that the code works, maybe include a verification with terminal velocity.",Looks like you know what it's all about.,Just remember for your final report in your theory to mention the equations for velocity and position using the trapezoidal rule and also the acceleration using the equation of motion plus your drag force.,Excellent organization of the report.,The figures looked clean and concise.,Solid explanation of Newton's method and how it makes the code more accurate.,Sorry about your car breaking down!,"You say ""it is very interesting..."" many times throughout the report and it doesn't really fit.",Your study section doesn't really flow that well in terms of reading it.,You should include a code verification.,You might want to make your graphs smaller so they don't take over the page and maybe introduce them a little more.,"Theorydocuments the equations implemented wellRecommend centering your equations and adding a captionOverall excellent report","Very well written, even with whatever you have left to include in the study and results section.",I personally don't have any suggestions.,Your report was structured in a very professional manner and very detailed.,"Theory is correct (3 pts)Code is not completely verified.","(1 pts)Computations are not completely done (1 pt)so in the first part (5 pts)Description of study.","(2 pt)Depth and significance (1 pt)New observations (1 pt)Scientific competence.","(1 pt)so the second part is needed to work on.","the report is a good read (2 pts) the report is not complete (1 pts)Conclusions connect to study: (0 pts)Presentation style (2 pts)so the total of all parts 15 out of 36You need to add the missing parts","Technical accuracy and completeness of theory and computations(a) All equations used in this project were properly described within the theory of the report.",(b) Program runs correctly and displays numbers within the ranges of expected values.,(c) Code is explicitly verified for values at terminal velocity.,This provides insight into the problem and resulting values.,(d) Inclusion of wind factor provides further insight and understanding on how this projectile would behave under certain conditions.,"Depth, interest, insight and scientific integrity of the study(a) The introduction clearly introduces the topic of the assignment and what concept this code is trying to convey.","It is concise and short, but provides all necessary information for an uninformed reader to follow.","(b) Since there was very little varying of parameters, though other factors were included in the initial computation (such as wind), the study could have provided more depth and significance.","The code runs correctly, but what does the output say about the study?",About drag force?,How does varying your wind force affect the output?,(c) No new information is given from further computations.,(d) No conclusion given.,"Quality of the report(a) The users English is sufficient, and the read runs very smoothly and effortlessly.",Transitions are easy to distinguish and the topics flow together throughout the entire report.,"(b) reproducing the calculations would not tell me much, with extra factors added into the code would tell me much when replaced with other values and compared to the initial output.",(c) No conclusion.,(d) The report looks professional.,"Equations flow nicely with text, and graphs were placed in a visually appealing manner.",Acceptable somehow even though you missed the conclusion but showed important information through the study.,Great report for what was completed.,Be sure to finish the report!,Good luck,Good introduction.,"Theory is decent, equations are properly annotated and formatted correctly.",I would add more depth into the theory section and tie the equations into the text.,Needs more work in Study and Results as well as the conclusion as notated in your pdf.,I would move the figures into the appendix and annotate them in-text.,You should provide more information through the theorem and study.,"Show how is it explicit and implicit, how newton's method is involved and the trapezoidal method too.",Good start and it seems to began organized too.,Good luck with the final version!,The report is unfinished.,"I would recommend to have the code in the original MATLAB format, it looks cleaner.",Provide a little more detail to the theory and investigation parts.,"In your introduction, you need to give what kind of drag force we are dealing with.",Also what is the difference between the explicit and implicit version in this code.,Your theory looks good with a majority of the equations.,"However, your missing the trapezoidal method using those equations of new velocity and new position.",This submission should be done and complete as if you were turning it into your teacher.,Due to the fact that it is not complete i cannot give a full critique of how you completed your project.,Theory: Theory is all correct.,Code seems to be all there as.,"Good jobInterest and Insight: Description was good, definitely need to add more before you submit the final reportQuality: It started out really good.","If you finish like you started, it will be a really good report.",Don't forget to label your figures!,"The theory behind this is great, but you are missing a results section.",This needs to be added before the final draft is turned in and you will have a much better report.,The Introduction to the project is well stated and even funny.,"You can talk about the parameters you mentions, like for example the concept of drag acting on a body moving through a fluid and how itŠ—Ès proportional to the velocity and opposite of the direction of motion.",The Theory Section of the report explains with great detail the equations and definitions of the forces that are being studied.,All variables are explained in order to clear any doubts.,The report is missing the Study and Result section.,"This is the most important part of the report, get it done.","Talk about changes done to the coding, and explain the outcomes using graphs.",Have a couple different modifications with their proper explanations.,The report is also missing the Conclusion.,CanŠ—Èt reach a conclusion without a study.,Get the previous part taken care of and the Conclusion will be easier to develop.,"The report includes the MATLAB coding, you can use the Š—“PublishŠ— feature in the script file window in order to make it seem nicer.","You have some work ahead of you, but it is totally possible to make this an excellent report with additions and modifications.","Good introduction and theory, I'd like to help with the rest of your project but since its not written then I unfortunately cannot help.",What you have so far looks good and the format is correct.,Good luck with the rest!,"For your report, you have really only completed part the report.","I like your Introduction, but try going into more depth in the Problem Statement and the Description of the Study.","For your Theory, your information is relevant but it seems like just a list that should really should actually flow.","Try explaining the theory behind the computing project in words, for example for the position, velocity, acceleration equations.","You have no evidence in your Study and Results, definitely include your results if you're code is running properly.","Then try to explain what you're results show, i.e.",MATLAB calculations and graph.,Adding some more images would be beneficial for you.,"Make sure not to forget about the Code Verification, Depth and Significance, and the other categories we are supposed to write about.",You need to write a Conclusion once you have updated your report.,"You also should have two codes, one for the explicit code and another for the implicit code.","The codes should involve not only drag, but terminal velocity as well.",Don't be afraid to explore and explain the computing project!,"The patch is just as described, a magnification of athletes of different types of sports.",It works by pressing four different keys to activate four different scenes.,"When the the same key trigger is pressed twice, there is a magnification bubble around the athlete to better see where exactly/what is going on.",The author created a better visual of athletes which reminds me somewhat of a video game where a button zooms/changes perspective (especially used in racing video games when changing from front to back view and zooming closer to the road).,It made me feel as though I was up close and with the athlete themselves.,"I think something that could make it better would be to trigger the magnification the same way, but figure out a way for it to not start back at the beginning.",The patcher is clean and laid out very nicely.,There is a clear easy to use presentation mode.,The keys all work as stated and the buttons on presentation mode work too:) It uses 8 Videos that are modifications of 4 videos.,A double press of a key plays the video again but this time with a magnification bubble so you can see the action more clearly.,The double press was a good idea and I like it a lot.,"You did need to press eight keys to see the videos, just double presses brought the modified videos up.",I see why he said it would have been nice to have the magnification and non magnification pick up at the same frame.,That is a great idea and was the only thing that could have made this project better.,"I liked the videos, they were fun to watch.","Although the patcher was not completed by the author, the general construction of the patcher was easy to understand and was not too complicated in layout.",The videos are triggered through the pressing of keys and it seems as though a zoomed version of the same video is triggered by another key on the patcher.,"Overall, the patcher would have been greatly executed if the author could have finished.",This problem is not so much about execution but rather the lack of time needed to execute the author's idea as he/she imagined.,"If i could improve your patch, I would clean up a few unnecessary elements in the patcher.",The patch is clean and very organized.,It includes a few notes to help the reader navigate through and use the patch.,"It works by linking a series of video clips to key and select objects, which then bang counters than toggle between two videos.","The concept of the patch is very intriguing, I must say.","While the intentions are kind of for naught with the current build, the idea proves to be one that could be pretty useful.","For example, what if I'm watching a video and suddenly see something that I want to zoom in on, but when I press the key again, the video starts over.",This kind of defeats the purpose of the entire patch because essentially the user either has to watch in magnified or non-magnified.,"I know time was an issue for you, so this is obviously something you know would improve the patch if you could.",The patch was well-laid out and easy to follow.,"When a key is pressed, a video is played and when the same key is pressed again, a magnified version of the same video is played.","There are two small technical issues, both having to do with repetition of key hits.","Once one hits the 'p' key to pause, there's not a means of unpausing without just restarting the videos.",This could be solved with a toggle for start/stop.,"Also, the counters don't reset when you move to a different video, so if you return to a video you've only seen the original of after switching to a different one, it jumps to the magnification.",This can be fixed by sending a 0 to all other counters upon opening the first video.,The original intent was to have the magnified videos start at the same frame as the original videos left off.,That could have been really cool.,When I opened the patch the first thing that struck me were the bright colors of the comment boxes.,There were five videos to cycle through and mess with using various effects.,"I know that to some people the intense colors could hurt their eyes, but I liked the color choice, it got my attention.",Some of the effects I couldn't get to work but overall it was fun to mess with.,The layout was neat and easy to understand even with the massive walls of text.,One thing I think that could be changed is the name of the 4th video is wrong.,"I watched most of it and I don't think it's Avicii, haha.","The actual wiring of the patch is hidden, even in edit mode and I couldn't see it so I'm still curious to how this was set up.",Overall they did a great job!,I liked this project.,Although it had a TON of features and some I didn't even really see made a big difference.,"However, the really cool ones were the video q,w,e,r - video effects.",That was something simple yet entertaining.,WOW.,This was a crazy complex patch.,Impressive.,I was able to press 5 different numbers and 4 different letters.,This patch played perfectly and i had no technical errors.,I loved that the patch was so colorful and caught my eye.,It makes you interested in what this patch plays and what more is it capable of doing.,The patch was very well organized.,"Thank you for writing the steps on it, because I wouldn't had known what to do.",It works good.,I honestly don't know how you could improve the project.,Wow!!!,You patch is pretty complex!,"and I just understand why did you name it ""Perspective"" I love the way that you organized preety much everything especially the different mode to show the video.","However there is a little thing in the instruction that should be change if you want to make it better, which is the instruction number 2 :  Hit escape to enter fullscreen.",When the user follow along with this instruction they will get to the full screen mode which is going to block them from the rest of the instructions.,Overall your project is super awesome!,"The patch has a neat, organized presentation in which connections are clear as to where they are coming from and going into.","It is a descending hierarchy, with the main input command, key, at the top going down in rows of the particular select commands, the movie files, and then the playback setup.","I was not able to make the videos play, probably due to the fact of my Mac being bootcamped to run Windows, which is causing problems with playback, even though I have Quicktime installed.","The videos, however, were very interesting' keeping with the musical style of the previous sequencer project.","Rap is not my preferred style of music so my reaction is very neutral, but the video they are taken from is interesting in its premise.","Since the music is the primary element of the individual clips, and we're learning now how to manipulate video with sound and other input, it would be cool to see it geared towards altering the pitch and overall volume as it plays, to make the clips a little more lively and entertaining for the user.","Your patch was very easy to read and to work but the keys ""G"", ""H"", ""J"", ""K"" are all repeats of the keys before which makes the over all concept boring and like you didn't give it much thought.",I really liked the song that you picked but I also wished you picked the keys that you chose with more intention.,If you wanted to do something simple to add keys without repeating the same video I would either split up the song more or connect keys to the stop and start buttons.,"Also, you never made the video full screen which would have been better just for viewing.","Upon opening, the patch was pretty simple and easy to follow.","Technically, the patch worked really well with little to no problems.","The author created a video playback based on one of his favorite songs, and it felt good for the most part.",I would say make the clips more unique as the last 3 are just repeats of the first few.,The patch looks neat and clean.,The toggle button to turn it on is at the top which makes it convenient.,"There is no presentation mode, however the keys to press are clearly labeled and easy to understand.",There are four clips of a song that play alternately by pressing one of 8 keys.,The only suggestion is that the ESC toggle from large to small screen.,I liked the concept of using a repetitive song that plays in different slices of time so you can mix it yourself.,The patch was an 8-video interface with a calm setting.,"Each video had a different environment meant to inspire relaxation, with a relaxing song to correspond with it.",There were 8 different windows (one for each video) as well as 8 different buttons to trigger them.,It actually did relax me!,I very much enjoyed the theme and the cool videos that went with them.,"The only improvement I'd add is to connect all of the videos to one window, that way they could all play through fullscreen and there wouldn't be the problem of two videos playing at once.",Great job!,Woah!,No wonder the created was feeling stressed!,That is a complicated patcher!,"There were 8 Jit windows, one for each video.",what I liked about this patch was that you could play more than one at a time.,A mixer of nature sounds and calming pictures.,Once I got all 8 on though it made me feel uneasy and out of control.,I got confused about how to turn it off and shut it down.,The concept of multiple windows all playing at one time is very nice.,This could have been improved by simplification.,It looks like a lot of time and care went into making this patch and the video selections.,This patch was so cool.,Initially it looked really difficult but than I actually analyzed and figured out its not that bad to do!,"Anyway,  I was very impressed.",The calming videos and sounds it was just so creative.,I liked that you put the caption to make sure the toggles were on and stuff.,Everything worked perfectly.,Esc key was nice and smooth.,This really is a calming patch.,The set up was well organized however I may have added like a pretty light back round just to calm it down a little bit.,"Im not sure, maybe it was me but I couldn't get the videos to play full screen only the balloon did but the other just played in the batch.",I loved the videos and sounds and the patch was well layer out it was kind of big so it didn't completely fit on the screen.,But really nice job.,The patch played videos triggered by touching keys on the home row after pressing the space bar to toggle it.,"Being a fan of the same videos featured in the patch, I enjoyed it quite a bit!",There were a variety of wires spread all over the patch (much like was said in the description) and it was hard to see where exactly they all led to.,"It works very well, though!",I had no problem figuring it all out.,It was a very cool patch overall!,"My only suggestion would be to organize it, although I'm sure with the number of wires there were it would be a difficult task.","This patch has a lot of buttons and a lot of wires, several videos and fortunately some instructions.",The space bar starts and stops the videos and keys 'a' through 'l' play videos.,Counters are used as switches to jump through clips by repeatedly pressing the letter key with which the specific clip is associated.,"I really like these videos, the whole genre of what they represent is so bizarre and interesting, and the jump ahead function is really gratifying.",The patch itself seems confusing and takes some time to really understand how it works but I like the creativity behind getting it to function.,I feel that whoever made this has interesting taste and the ability to do creative problem solving in their development of an idea.,"Again, I couldn't full screen to work properly and that would have been super nice because these videos are so great!","Maybe next time also utilize presentation mode, it would have been cool to just enjoy what this patch does without feeling overwhelmed by being confronted with such a tangle of wires.",The patch looks very complicated with many wires and counters.,It many different connections which give it a bit of a hectic feel.,It works by connecting the each button on the home row to a counter and starting a new video about creating Japanese candy.,The videos worked in order and they was also a fullscreen option.,The cool thing about the videos was that by pressing the next key in the order of the home row you could forward the video.,Maybe for improvement try using the panel object to hid the complicated wires.,You could also encapsulate many of the connections to create sub patches and that would make the patch seem really simple.,"This project was great, I'm still cracking up, it is simple to follow and the product is more than great.","After a while I was even able to time it with the song, and the fact that there is so many parts to it, it's very impressive that it is as clean and aesthetically pleasing to look at as it is.","Very well done, no improvement suggestions.",I really enjoyed this project.,"At first  opening it, it was scary to see sooo many video files, but it worked wonderfully.","When I first open it, I am already excited.","It is a great layout and I like the use of different colors for the various cords, buttons, etc.",Not your average dull grey and whites.,When I first opened the folder my jaw dropped at how many video files were included with the patch!,"Then come to find out it's 20 different clips that are related to Miley Cyrus', Wrecking Ball.",Absolutely stoked.,I had fun pushing various keys trying to make some kind of pattern with the notes that are playing in the song.,It kind of made me feel nostalgic and scared that the song is going to be stuck in my head once again for 2 weeks.,The patch featured many Miley Cyrus-themed videos that are triggered by keys on the home row of the keyboard.,It was laid out in a very neat and organized manner and the colors were very aesthetically pleasing.,It was cool to see!,The content was also very funny.,It was cool hearing that the song played regardless of what video was playing and kind of made it a fun music video creating game.,"I wouldn't give any improvement suggestions, it was cool!",The patch has good visuals.,There are colors representing the start button.,"There big, buttons also help visualize and quickly scan for the keys to press.",The patch kinda looks like water pipes because they are very structured and straight with many turns.,The patch was executed cleanly and the all the videos worked.,"The buttons were clever as the ""b"" key corresponded with the video.","The patch was good and maybe for improvement, they could organize the patch a bit more simpler because there seems to be many subpatches all laid out so try encapsulation.",This patch is really fun.,"I like the incorporation of a game show in max, I would love to see this idea expanded upon!",When in presentation mode the layout is nice and clean.,But even playing not while in presentation mode I still could see what they were trying to do and it still was laid out nicely.,There were lots of comments describing what each thing was doing and I could clearly see how they structured their patch.,Great job!,"First off, the patch was easy to follow upon opening it, the patch worked pretty well upon following the instructions.","The creator here has made a video response akin to the show who wants to be a millionare, and it felt satisfying to use.","I would've loved more questions to be played, but due to the file size restriction on this project, it's understandable",This patch was HUGE on my screen.,"I think this is mostly a Max feature that's pretty annoying on screens that are smaller than the one the patch was created on, but I had to zoom out twice to see everything included in your patch.","Anyway, other than the size, the patch was fairly easy to navigate and use.","I liked that the trigger letters were given, because when lazy I kind of just like to get straight to the point.",My one suggestion would be refine your video choices.,"While it was clear comedy was your intention - the clips weren't all from films and they weren't all ""classic""(this may be subjective), which can be considered misleading because of your description.","However, if that weren't a factor, I think this is a solid project, and the only thing I noticed was that you have an extra ""read"" button(near the start/stop buttons) that doesn't serve much of a purpose in this particular project.","This patch didn't really sway me in feeling one was or another, though I did get a chuckle from a few of the videos.","Even though you are a beginner with max I could tell that you still pushed yourself, which is great and is definitely how you will continue to elaborate on future work.",The design and functionality is very clean and straightforward included eight keys that engage the user with the video footage.,"I like that you had fun with it, I definitely got a good laugh out of the clips.",Visually it is a very strong piece as it is well organized and not intimating for the user to interact with.,Possible adding another layer of effects within the videos could have taken it to the next level.,"Overall, good work!",The patch is pretty simple.,It looks very much like the example from class.,"It would be useful to have instructions such as ""click here"" for the toggle to make sure the qmetro object starts, and ""press 'esc' to initiate fullscreen mode.""","Knowing how to make the patch work properly, it was able to perform as the assignment requested.","The concept of comedy clips was well done, but it didn't feel super cohesive to me.",It didn't make me feel any particular way.,When I first opened your patcher I turned on presentation mode and noticed your message in big letters.,It caught my attention and made me want to test out your patcher.,"I couldn't get your patcher to work until I turned on your metro,after that everything worked as you described.",you could have rigged it to fire with a key stroke,Very simple and straight forward.,It plays eight different clips (looping) corresponding to different keys on the keyboard.,"The buttons are clearly labeled, so the user knows which buttons will do something.","Before clicking any buttons to play the clip, the qmetro need to be toggled, so the video can be played.",There is also a button to return frames from the video if the qmetro is toggled off.,"There are some additional bits on the side which can be controlled with sliders: rate, time, frame, volume.",It works well.,It is very minimal.,The clips were pretty iconic.,Pretty simple and fun to watch.,The mechanics of it are not particularly interesting since it only plays videos.,"If there were additional things that the keys did, it would be more fun to play with.",This patcher had numerous videos that were all trigger by pressing a certain key.,"With the toggle to the patch switched on, you could then press any key you like to play the videos.",I liked the patch because it was neat and very easy to follow.,There was also ease of use due to the notes that the created added into the patch which made things more understandable.,"This patch could be made even better with values that could alter the videos, such as volume or fast forwarding but overall a very nice job.","Overall, the patch looks really nice, and clean.","However the video that you picked seems random to me because I barely see the connection between each video, and also the name ""Humor.""","I think this project can be better if you use ""Loadbang"" to start putting everything in fullscreen, and pick the group of videos that kinda tell the story.",The way that which the patch is described is very easy to under what it's trying to accomplish.,It is a simple eight video player that changes the video when a set of keys are pressed.,The way that which this patch works is similar to that of the patch that which we were introduced to.,"There is a key object that is attached to various select objects that select the certain ASCII codes that hook up to each individual video, which are activated by a metro object, a toggle, and both a Jitter QuickTime movie object and a Jitter Window object that allows the video to play in a separate window from the patch.","In order to let the video part show itself to the user, the user must ensure that the toggle is on to show the video or else just the audio would play.",There is also a subpatch that allows the user to enter fullscreen mode and exit out of fullscreen mode by clicking the ESC key.,"While using this patch, I thought it was very interesting to see what videos were going to play.","While there was some videos that corresponded to one another, there was some videos that I thought were a strange addition.",I also liked that there is a warning about turning the toggle on so that I was able to watch the videos right away.,"Also, I liked how both the toggle and the stop message were both a bright red color so that it would draw more attention to it.",One suggestion that I would make in order to improve on this patch is to possibly have higher definition videos that are possibly shorter.,Some of the videos that which I saw were really rough and somewhat pixelated when I tried to watch them.,I really liked your patch.,I ran into a problem originally when I opened up the patch and no video played.,I was able to quickly make the patch operate afterward by adding your video files to the patch folder.,I really liked your layout as well as your content.,"I switched over to the Mac side, so everything works fine.","Like the basic structure of the patch, it is organized in a descending, pillar like manner with the playback controls and setup at the bottom.",The specific letters are placed in comment boxes next to their bang messages.,The patch works just like it was requested of us to do; it plays specific video files when the corresponding keyboard button is pressed and can also be viewed in fullscreen.,"The videos are quite random, there being Cyanide and Happiness short animations and I'm guessing clips of the author playing League of Legends and messing around on a subway train.","They're alright, but do not elicit emotions or feelings from myself.",I suggest taking different video files that have more commentary or energy to them.,I like the way the patch is organized and labeled with instructions.,I wasn't able to watch all of the videos because I have a lack of time.,But all functions work and serve their purpose.,The first impression of this patch upon opening is that it is very organized and set up well.,The number keys activate the videos which is a testament to this patch's functionality.,The videos were also very cool and I enjoyed exploring this patch.,This patch is gorgeous.,Easy to follow and the design in presentation mode was a good touch.,"I was initially confused about how the frame rate worked in relation to the mouse, but upon playing with it some it became quite clear.","The video was all interesting, and I'm intrigued about the artist's work.","Fantastic, top to bottom, really.","I would've liked to see it have some more comments as I'm not super sure what each of the switch objects are doing, but that may just be a failure on my end.",Well done.,Very interesting patch.,Not really sure what the theme is but it is very well organized.,I like how each button triggers a different video.,I think the one thing that needs improvement is ur volume adjuster.,It doesn't run as smooth as I would like but everything else is really good.,The patch is very clean and organized.,It's a pretty direct hit-key-open-video thing.,"For uniformity's sake, I'd have liked something on z, but otherwise, it's okay.",Tied together well thematically.,"I had to manually start the metro, which while okay I would have preferred to have that be a keypress too.",Patch contains a large selection of clips linked to letter keys which play back clips from harry potter.,Each clip is of a character saying a word that begins with the corresponding letter key.,The full screen function works but will not play back videos.,The metronome needs to be turned otherwise everything functions as one would expect.,A lot of time was obviously taken to generate video content and conceptually was extremely successful and consequently gratifying and fun to play with.,I wish the full screen worked properly and that some notes were included that gave instructions about the order in which to do things.,The work is a simple max patch that takes the user through the alphabet with a theme of harry potter.,"The patch works using a jit object, qmetro, and video files.",I thought it would be nice to have a more clean presentation.,They used clips from the Harry Potter series that corresponded with the letters of the alphabet.,The patch is straight forward and doesn't hide anything.,The functions show 3 different key groups hooked up to a video player.,The only suggestion that I would add would be to utilize the patchers within patchers.,This is a great way to hide the complexity of the wiring and to make the patch look customized and fun.,"I do like the videos picked and it overall does what it is supposed to, great job.","The layout and concept are cool, although the description gets kind of wordy and confusing.","However, I thought part of the assignment as David presented it in class was that the videos must be played fullscreen.",The patch mostly worked as intended.,"The keys ""PLEASHUT"" did not shut things off as described.",Having more than one file play at a time felt a little too busy.,"Maybe with each key press in ""KINGOFWRD"" at least the sound from each previous video could be turned off.","Right of the bat, the patch was well laid out and neatly designed.","It seems like he put a lot of effort into designing the overall layout of the patch, not to mention the effort he put into making the patch.",I like that there were added videos and that it was almost like a game.,The patch was fun to use and relatively easy!,Only thing I can say is maybe add a little more colors into the patch.,This piece was definitely the most thought provoking of all the patches I reviewed.,I experienced an overall feeling of sheer disgust and frustration over these horrendous historical occurrences and the parallels between events leading from as far back as WWII to recent Isamic terrorist videos released from ISIS.,"I think the specific choice of the footage was very clever in capture the user and conveying the underlining message; Power, greed, corruption, global devastation, etc.",The design and layout was extremely creative and outside the box with the use of the tarot card reading to trigger sequence of the video footage.,"This far exceeds my skill set with max, therefore, I have no additional improvements to suggest.","Overall, great piece!",Looks like a sweet patch but unfortunately I could not get it working :(,The patch is simple and neatly organized.,I can easily see what goes to what and how it is supposed to work.,"Everything worked perfectly, with each letter in the word ""dinosaur"" playing a different video clip and the ""!""",stopping the playback.,"As for the concept, dinosaurs were interesting.",The only thing I would suggest is to find a better cut off point for the clips.,I understand that you don't want them to be too long but the cut off points were kind of awkward for some of them.,The sequencer was really well done.,I had no problems in full or patch mode.,I liked the way the videos all worked together.,"The patch worked by reading in key presses and sending bangs to a read messages for the letters of ""dinosaur!"".","Each read message triggered a different short clip, with the exclamation point stopping the clips.","The clip of ""Not the Momma"" had my friends and I rolling on the floor since we still make reference to that show.",Now if only KeSha's Dinosaur would play when you pressed the exclamation point...,This patcher had numerous videos that were all trigger by pressing a certain key that all had one common interest; dinosaurs.,"With the toggle to the patch switched on, you could then press any key you like to play the videos.","This patch was fun because it actually had a theme, and I am sure no one else in the class used videos all about dinosaurs therefore it is quite unique.","This patch could be made even better with values that could alter the videos, such as volume or fast forwarding.","The lay out was simple, clean, and very colorful.","Various messages around each button tell the user which key to press to get each video, and the videos were quite enjoyable.","And while it wasn't annoying or in the way, there was a popup video window that came up when I loaded the patch and I couldn't get rid of it.","Otherwise, it was a neat patch and the videos were very fun to watch, especially the ""epic win"" video.",The approach was really nice.,I liked that there was a definitive theme (action packed vehicle stunts) and you made it clear what the patch was doing within the patch.,The author created a selection of samples of different stunts.,It was interesting to use.,I would say spend a little bit more time on the presentation.,"If I understand correctly, the patch didn't actually open in presentation mode, but rather, it opened with a setting that deleted all the connection wires.",I didn't know that was possible.,Simple patch and awesome videos.,"I liked the concept and that you hid the ""wires.",and because those are hidden I would have made the clips bigger and in the center rather than in the corner.,Nice work.,"After the reading the description of this patch, I knew that the theme of this video key patch was going to be that of motorcycles.","When I first loaded the patch, I liked how I was able to see all the different colored buttons that represented each key that I needed to press.","Along with the colors, each button is labelled with their corresponding key as well.",Another addition that I thought was really convenient was the addition of a start and stop key that would start and stop videos when the user would need them.,The way that which this patch works is similar to that of the patch that which we were introduced to.,"There is a key object that is attached to various select objects that select the certain ASCII codes that hook up to each individual video, which are activated by a metro object, a toggle, and both a Jitter QuickTime movie object and a Jitter Window object that allows the video to play in a separate window from the patch.","In order to let the video part show itself to the user, the user must ensure that the toggle is on to show the video or else just the audio would play.",There is also a subpatch that allows the user to enter fullscreen mode and exit out of fullscreen mode by clicking the ESC key.,There are also two keys that both stop and start the video and audio from playing.,I really enjoyed going over this patch.,The colors and labels definitely help relay information to the user on what keys need to be pressed and the videos were high definition so that they didn't look pixelated when they were played in fullscreen mode.,My only suggestion would be to write a warning about turning the toggle on.,"I forgot a couple times to turn it on while I was going over this patch and I'm pretty sure that if others saw this patch, they would probably do the same.",Wow...Your HIRED!,This is the most incredible patch!,First it opens in presentation mode!,It is completely animated.,The user interface is clear and you get to control the animations of the Totem Pole.,It is beautiful and has many advanced effects!,Once I looked under the presentation mode I saw how it was made and was even more impressed.,"The only thing I would do differently, is not give it all away up front.","Once I got the chance to control the totem, my abilities to do so were lack luster compared to the way that the patch opens all by itself.",The most amazing patch ever!,I just opened your patch and I felt like I clicked an advertisement on some website that I wasn't supposed to open.,"Awesome work honestly, I feel like you might've just did the most precise work I've ever seen.","Everything looks professionally done, Pat.","It immediately came up right when I clicked on the patch, and everything works perfectly fine when it comes to how it's done technically.","You created a weird, totem pole-ish symbolic figure that allows each part of it to do it's own things.","I can't even offer a suggestion honestly, you did a lot of work for this.",I critiqued the first one of this last time!,"I have to say I like the way this one works better than the previous one, considering it is not on continuous loop.",The patch is presented nicely with colorful text and colorful artwork (the totem pole).,The work consists of a totem pole where each specific part makes a sound depending on which key is pressed.,The author created a simple and unique design of an interactive sound making and animated totem pole.,It made me excited to actually be able to control the sound this time.,"I don't really have anything to suggest, I was going to say to make it so more than one sound played but I practically spazzed on the keyboard and all the sounds played together rather unharmoniously that it sort of slowed down the animation.",whoops.,Very cool!,I enjoyed watching all the blues guitarists.,If you used sub patch though the presentation would be alot better and alot less cluttered.,Also one cool idea would be a volume adjuster or maybe a video affect.,"Overall though this was a pretty good patch, very easy to use.",Your patch was very simple and easy to work.,I really like how it was labeled with the artists name and the keys weren't anything random like other stuff I've seen so far.,I also really liked your video's It was interesting which artists you liked the most and it was fun to watch.,"The only think I wish would change is the length of the videos, I wish I could see more or know what song they were playing so i could look it back up.",I know the videos couldn't really be any longer though cause of the size of the file.,Very simple and straight forward.,It plays six different clips (looping) corresponding to different keys on the keyboard as well as a pause and play key.,"The buttons are clearly labeled, so the user knows which buttons will do something.","Before clicking any buttons to play the clip, the qmetro need to be toggled, so the video can be played.",It works well.,It is very minimal.,Very user friendly and easy to understand.,"The clips were nice, simple and fun to watch.",The mechanics of it are not particularly interesting since it only plays videos and pauses/starts the videos.,"If there were additional things that the keys did, it would be more fun to play with.","The patch looks nice, and clean, however the video that you picked can be more creative and have more variety.","I think this project can be better if you can have a purpose for the entire video that you selected, also use ""Loadbang"" to start putting everything in fullscreen, turn on metronome.",Great work!,I really enjoy the presentation of the various guitar artists you selected to show for the keys.,This patch is very well organized and I have a clear understanding of how it will work at first glance of it.,I would have understood it better if you colored the start and stop buttons differently than the rest of the buttons.,"Since I don't have the greatest vision and am a lazy reader at times, I pressed the Q key expecting something to work right off the bat.",Now I see I should have read your description first.,"Anyhow, it's very historical and entertaining.",Good work!,The patch was very well organized.,It works good.,I honestly don't know how you could improve the project.,Except probably make it more visually impressive to look at.,"But overall, you did a good job.",The patch looks like the one designed in class.,"Overall very neatly done, a little clustered in some areas but it gets hard to organize a patch after a while.","The technical aspect was pretty much exactly like the one in the video, but it was nicely done.",All the keys worked and so did the videos.,The music made the patch fun and enjoyable!,I might have added in some colors to brighten up the patch.,Overall great job!,Good music!,Patch was clean and simple.,I didn't encounter any issues with the patch I loved how the music worked together.,Great patch!,This patch looks like it is organized well and I can see how this patch works.,"The patch is also very functional, as the corresponding videos came up with no problem upon pressing the designated keys.",The videos also caught my attention as they were very contrasting.,Overall a great looking and working patch!,It looks really nice and organized.,The colors of the objects are also a really nice touch which makes it more interesting.,"The patch works by clicking the big blue toggle box, then the rest of the controls are used by the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h. The first thing to do is load one of the many videos the creator has supplied and then you can change the color, make it go in slow-mo, change the volume from on and off.",Overall it feels good and works really well.,The setup is really straightforward and not confusing.,The only thing I would possibly change is the keys chosen.,"a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h aren't very conveniently placed on a keyboard, so maybe next time you could pick a row of keys.","For example, use z, x, c, v, b, n, m and ,.",That way the keys are right next to each other and less difficult to find on the keyboard.,This patch is awesome.,"Originally I was confused how to operate it because you had to load each sample individually, but I then realized I could pretty much open up every file in my HD so you made a pretty effective media player.",I also thought it was creative how you made the buttons more appealing by creating a color scheme and adding layers.,"The patch is very colorful, and there is a list of instructions on what each key does.","Very easy to use, and the user can upload a video from the folder to play around with different colors and speed.",It was fun to play around with each key to change various things while the video was playing.,I can't think of anything that might be improved since it was well made.,This project doesn't fit the criteria at all.,"The key presses are assigned to perform tasks within the patch, not play videos by each key press.","Additionally, the video content is not from YouTube.","The patch works by pressing 'B' to open a dialog box and select what video you would like to play, then having seven other various controls, none of which do what the assignment asks.",This patch could be improved by setting up the keys to play each of the 8 videos included.,"At first, the patch didn't feel organized upon opening it.","But I was quite amazed how he was able to get both the video and the music to work at the same time, complete with instructions on how to work it all.","Here, he combines a video of a philosophical lecture with an art animation/music video, and thanks to the added fader tool, it makes me feel calm and that my mind is being tuned in to the lecture and the music.","I will say that the file was over 100 mb, so a smaller clip size would've been nice, but overall, it's not so bad.",Everything looks clean in the patch and is easy to work with but there are only two videos.,The fader that you included is cool and the play/pause buttons are a nice touch.,I think you could have weaved in some more videos and cut these two videos down a bit!,I really like the concept of your philosophical lecture patch.,"It didn't really make me feel anything, but it did grab my attention.","It works very good, very easy to understand, and thank you for labeling it.",I'd probably just make the patch look cleaner and more organized.,"The patcher was built very nice and was not too difficult to understand, unlike the other patches I've critiqued.",Assigned keys can trigger the display the particular video what seems to related to each other.,"The user can press alpha keys to trigger different stages of the animation, passing freely between the sparse, illuminated chambers at the beginning and the dark, morphing, and occupied later stages.","From reading the description, I was very intrigued by the concept.","From opening the patch, it looked very simple and I was able to figure out which keys and what to use.","The only issue would be some of the video's quality, which is really hard to find sometimes when on YouTube.","But overall, the patch worked and sounded great.",This patcher had numerous videos that could physically be rearranged.,I like how this patch was very much involved in the different things that could be done as the audience.,"The only thing I would suggest improving on is making the patch a little more friendlier on the eyes and neater, and probably have more comments explaining things so that new users are not left in the dark.", The concept was to play a song in stages and show the many people and places the song has been played.,This was great.,This patch uses a feature I have not seen before.,"The turn off loop, too bad I didn't know about it when I made my patch.",I really liked that the video stopped because it made me want to press the next key to continue the song.,This patch was enjoyable to use.,The patch is fairly complex in design but is not too confusing to figure out.,The alpha keys assigned can trigger the video files to begin playing on the monitor object within the patch.,"Overall, the patch is enjoyable through the video selection.","If I could change anything about the patch to improve, I would simplify the order of the patcher objects to give a more organized appearance.","Otherwise, good execution for the project!",This is a fun patch!,I like the way you set it up; easy instructions and clean.,I would have moved the toggle box to a different area or increased its size to make it more noticeable.,So the idea is to view different endings and cutscenes form tekken?,Interesting idea and I think you did a good job of getting in a lot of videos.,The videos play well too; good job on compression :),"The work is easy to follow and looks similar to the example from class, the esc key allows you to go fullscreen which is nice.","As for the videos, there are plenty to choose from and each one is interesting, I like the concept and it was present very well.","The only thing I'd suggest is maybe cutting the scenes a bit shorter, I can understand why the patch was over 100mb though.",when I first opened your patch I saw that you had lots of buttons and videos loaded up to play.,I started hitting keys and different cartoons played for each key that had a video connected to it.,The patcher functions as it is supposed to.,"The one thing I noticed  was that I had to turn on the metro to get it to work, You could have connected it to the key object at the top of your patcher and the any key stroke would have started your metro.",I liked the videos and how the patcher worked otherwise.,It looks simple and organized with a good structure that is easy to follow.,There are nice big instructions on how to use the patch which I always seem top appreciate because it makes the user not have to figure it out.,"Once I started using it, I was instantly entertained.",The creator has done a great job creating different videos that are mixed with songs.,It was really entertaining.,I enjoyed it a lot.,"Overall, I thought it was a very well made patch and I dont really have much advice to give.",It works very well and is also very user friendly.,Vroom Vroom!,Simple patch that works perfectly.,"It is organized, labeled and functions properly.","The patch was clean, colorful, and very well laid out.",There was also a little description for the user to understand how the patch works.,"The videos in the patch made me laugh because of who it was, and the various things that were being thrown at him.","Each key did something different, and something different was thrown at him.","There was also an ""accident"" video depending on which key was hit, and was called the ""wrong"" key if you got that video.",Made me laugh.,I really can't think of anything that might be added since it was a very well done patch.,Maybe use sub patch so that everything is less cluttered.,Also maybe use a sequence of keys so its easier to flow from video to video.,The repeats got pretty frustrating.,"The patch worked by reading key presses and either playing a certain video if it was a good key, or an ""accident"" video if it was the wrong key.","I was a fan of the colored buttons, and most of the clips were pretty humorous.","For some of the videos though, I was a little uncertain of what was being thrown or the clip was too short so it appeared glitchy.","(The video for k stood out most) Just to clean up the patch a little bit, you could use a single select for the good keys instead of several selects.","DescriptionThis patch is an interactive pet simulator- pressing the buttons allows you to perform various activities with your virtual pet chicken.","Technical analysisWhen a key is pressed, the action causes one of several available videos to play.",Each button corresponds to a different activity.,"Conceptual analysisPoints for creativity and hilariousness!",The author shows how a diverse skill set is integral to the creation of a well rounded user experience.,"SuggestionWhy not take it a little further?","A couple counter objects and gate, and you could have a fully fledged game.","For example,""you can only ride the chicken after unlocking it by waking up and feeding the chicken"" would add a layer of depth to this game.","I really enjoyed this work, it took the interactive aspect to a whole new level that I haven't seen in other patches.","The patch is very simple to read, the color coding helps, and it does exactly what it needs to.","The video's themselves are super creative and had me laughing a ton, I enjoyed the key prompts that were put up on the screen so you can pick what to choose next.","Overall I don't have any suggestions, the patch was perfect for the assignment criteria.",I think your concept is really cool.,I love the way that you created something meaningful rather than just a video play  I believe that the video that you made can be improve by using visual effect software like Adobe After Effect.,"The patch that you created is simple but powerful, however it would be better if you start the video with the chicken picture instead of using black screen.","Just looking at the patch, it is very colorful and seems pretty exciting and the comments help the user know what's going on.","Specific keys send a bang to certain videos that will play once you press them, it's pretty basic, not very different from what we did in class.",Conceptually this is hilarious!,I'm impressed with the amount of work they put into the videos to make them specifically for this class.,It's also a very unique way of having the user interact with the patch rather than just being an observer.,"The only suggestions I have are to maybe make it so that if the user presses the escape key the dock will go away as well, so the screen is completely clear and also to make the in-patch window larger.",This is awesome!,Its very comical and well done.,The patch looks clean and nice and everything seems to work perfectly!,Very amusing how it works.,You created an interactive environment for the viewers to control and its very interesting!,Great work!,"First off Alice and wonderland is an amazing Disney movie, a very trippy one that is.","The patch works the way it supposed to, start and stop keys both works including the ESC key as well.","However all the clips are very similar in this patch were you trying to create a ""who are you""introduction?",great patch everything looks clean and a good theme going on there.,This patch is overall well made and I especially like how your samples interact with one another.,I found that each clip with its own music when played in sequence with the other clips almost began to create some dissonant music.,Plus this was paired with the video footage.,"I opened the patch and was pleased to see how simple it was, and with the use of presentation mode, even more so.","It took me a bit to figure out exactly how to work it, but once I did I enjoyed finding each letter and making it work.",The idea behind the Alice in Wonderland scene was very creative.,"I don't have any suggestions for the patch, it was all very smooth, and I especially likes being able to go in to presentation mode, as stated before.",Very simple and straight forward.,It plays eight different clips (looping) corresponding to different keys on the keyboard.,"The buttons are clearly labeled, so the user knows which buttons will do something.","Before clicking any buttons to play the clip, the qmetro does NOT need to be toggled, so the video can be played.",There is a load bang.,It works well.,It is very minimal and user friendly.,I did not know about the load bang.,That was very helpful.,The clips simple.,The mechanics of it are not particularly interesting since it only plays videos.,But I did think it was very cool that you use load bang.,I did not know that existed.,Upon opening the patch it looked very nicely put together.,"However, when I pressed the corresponding buttons I couldn't get the video to start working.","I could hear the audio however, so I was unsure whether I had presssed the wrong button.","Also, I noticed there was no start button so initally I was just randomly pressing buttons trying to figure out which one would make the video start.",But then I found out that render frames would start the video.,Also not all the videos were of Jimmy Kimmel so maybe for improvement you could match the patch with the concept of your project.,"The patch is pretty basic, there isn't anything very special in the way they organized it; however, I do like the key-guide to the left.",This patch works the same way as we learned in class.,"Specific keys send a bang to videos as well as, start, stop, and rendering the frames and that plays in the window.",I think the idea behind the video is not that exciting and since all of the intros are basically the same it got a little dull after a while but having a theme was a nice way of unifying the work.,"My suggestion is to give an instruction that tells the user to turn on the toggle, because I stumbled for a moment before I remember to do that and also to make the in-patch window a little larger.",The work is various clips of different musical artists performing both on Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon's shows starting with the introduction first.,"It works by pressing five different keys to activate the clips but there are extra keys to press that allow for the clips to stop, resume, and render the footage which is a nice addition instead of closing out of fullscreen mode to simply stop the clip.",The author created a series of well known songs performed which was nice to watch.,"It did not really change how I felt, I think it was more for entertainment purposes.","When I played a couple of the videos, the playback was kind of spastic, and when I went to render the clip it didn't seem to do much so maybe looking at and adjusting the video fps could help.","The patch read key presses and sent bangs to buttons, on to either a toggle to get the current frame, or jit.qt.movie messages.","The movies were all themed around musical guests on Jimmy Kimmel's show, but I felt as though playing more of the act than the first 10 - 20 secs would have made for a stronger execution of the theme.",For some reason on my computer Max struggled with the Iggy Azalea clip (topped at ~8fps) but had no trouble with the other 4 (average ~30fps).,"As far as patching goes, you could accomplish the play/pause function using a single key if you hooked the select object to a toggle and from there to a message of ""rate $1"".","The toggle would then send a value of either 0 or 1 every time you pressed the key, eliminating the need for unique start/stop keys.","Additionally you do not need to have different sel objects for each key, you can add those all to a single sel with each key listed.",This patch is very clean and organized and well done.,You used a basic project to do but it works well and it looks great.,Very funny videos and It was fun to watch.,I kind of like how you didn't go all out and try some huge thing and use all of the keys like everyone else.,great job,"DescriptionThis patch plays a video when the asdfghjk keys are pressed.","Technical analysisThe key object waits for a key press which triggers a read message with the video file name to be loaded into the jit window.","Conceptual analysisOverall, this patch utilizes a simplistic design to deliver a ""low brow chuckle"".","It's really easy to see how it works, the labels make the author's intent clear: laugh.","SuggestionMy only suggestion would be to move the video window higher in the patch, on a small screen it is difficult to see the buttons and the video at the same time.","Other than that, everything looks very good.",This patch looks clean and has the basic setup for a video key patch.,"It works too, and I found that the videos that were triggered were interesting.",Overall though this patch gets the job done and does it right.,"When you go into presentation mode, it's very pleasing to the eye, and very clear in what you're supposed to do.",You just hit a key to play a certain video.,"The videos were all pretty funny, especially the last one with Sir Ben Kingsley swearing like a sailor.","It was nicely done, and very well constructed, and it works how the creator wanted to.",I really can't think of anything that might need to be improved on.,The first thing I noticed when I opened your patcher was the Halloween theme and how you were able to make it look Halloween like.,The videos were fun to watch.,"I had to turn on your metro, you could have rigged it to the key object to turn on with any key stroke.","Well, you certainly nailed your intended theme!","The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great watch, so I enjoyed seeing this.","However, the videos you chose were really long and I found myself getting kind of bored and tired of waiting for them to end.","I know this wasn't really taught to us, but I think setting it up so the videos don't play back from the beginning every time the key is pressed would really improve the work.","Visually, the patch is very fun to look at.",It was a wise and creative move to recolor the objects - it really adds to the dynamic and makes the halloween theme decidedly apparent.,A suggestion would be to include more videos.,"The assignment called for at least 8 keys, and you only used three.","This patch is designed to play different parts/musical numbers from the movie ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" upon pressing three different keys.","Technically, it works very similarly to the example patch from class.","Conceptually, the patch is evocative of the spirit of Halloween, but is otherwise too simple to be really engaging.","The author might improve this work by including more clips mapped to more keys, or by sticking to a more cohesive and specific theme.","DescriptionThis patch plays a couple pieces from Tim Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" when the b , d , and l keys are pressed.","Technical ananysisThe key object waits for a key press, if b, d, or l are pressed, then a corresponding video is loaded into the jit player.","Conceptual analysisThe author makes a good use of the ability to customize the look of the patch.","Coloring the background black, and the other objects yellow and orange makes the whole patch feel like ""halloween"".","I especially enjoyed to SuggestionFor queuing the metro automatically, you can use the loadbang object, that way the user doesn't have to do it themselves.","Also, don't be afraid to really play with the patches that Tinapple gives us in class- I noticed that the button attached to the jit.qt.movie object that shows how you can display each frame with a bang, didn't really add to the experience of this patch.","At first glance I can't see the video window without scrolling to the bottom of the patch, it may be better if you make that one of the first visible things.","Also, consider using the [loadbang] object to open the metro toggle and the start button.","I like the creative effort you put into resizing the buttons and aligning the patch cords, it makes it look nice.","You might want to try adding a [panel] object to hide some of those things, though.","I was surprised to see so many clips in such a small file size, I like that you used short lengths of footage.","It saved on the download time, this is something I disregarded completely.",Good work!,The patch plays several short video clips upon pressing different keys.,"Technically, it is an expanded version of the patch from class.","Conceptually, it's very simple, and seemingly designed more for fun than for any other artistic purpose; it's function is pretty similar to that of a soundboard.","The author might improve this work by cranking up the volume on some of these clips, as the source material seems to be a bit quiet.",This patch is quite colorful--the bang messages have many layers of different colors--and conceived in the prescribed demo structure.,"The program works by taking the input of the user, in this case pressing a letter on the keyboard, and seeing as it triggers a video clip to play through the patch; the user also has the capability of watching the clip in fullscreen mode and can leave it with a press of the Escape key.","Not to be biased, but Clint Eastwood is one of my all-time favorite actors, so the viewing of his many memorable, insanely famous quotes was quite entertaining.","If you could implement all the video manipulating commands we were just taught to control speed, volume, and maybe even pitch, that would be a great enhancement.",I enjoyed the cartoons in the patch.,I appreciated that I had to find out the keys for myself.,"What the author of the patch did was quite simple, making video clips play with certain keys.","As far as suggestions go, perhaps better cuts of the clips for looping purposes.","After reading the description for this patch, I thought that it was going to be interesting that this patch was going to be a game in order to find out the correct order of the entire overall video.",The way that which this patch works is similar to that of the patch that which we were introduced to.,"There is a key object that is attached to various select objects that select the certain ASCII codes that hook up to each individual video, which are activated by a metro object, a toggle, and both a Jitter QuickTime movie object and a Jitter Window object that allows the video to play in a separate window from the patch.","In order to let the video part show itself to the user, the user must ensure that the toggle is on to show the video or else just the audio would play.",There is also a subpatch that allows the user to enter fullscreen mode and exit out of fullscreen mode by clicking the ESC key.,"Also, the spacebar stops the video from looping.","Once again, I had fun trying to figure out what the order was, the question marks that masked what the letter for the word was very creative and I thought that it was pretty cool that if I pressed the wrong keys that the letters that I already had up would reset.",It made me very cautious as to which key to press.,I also liked how the instructions and even the size of the toggle were large so that the user would automatically know what to do.,"My only suggestion would be to add a button that starts the loop back up again, like how the space bar stops the loop.",It was very inconvenient that I would have to press the start message to start it back up again instead of just pressing a key.,This was a really cool patch.,I thought it was cool that you made a game out of it.,"It works very good, press a key and you get the video to play.",The patch was very well organized and had a lot of style.,"Nothing I would suggest to make this better, except for maybe trying to scale down the project so you don't have to keep scrolling up.","The patch is well laid out, has a couple quick instructions, a little splash of color, and a ""game"" aspect to it.","After you turn on the toggle, you begin pressing buttons to determine what letters comprise the word.","When a correct key is pressed, the question marks turn into the proper letter.","However, if your next guess is unsuccessful, all question marks re-appear.",It would be nice if correct keystrokes remained.,It was a fun little game nonetheless.,I like what you going with this how it is a puzzle and the user has to guess what keys to press to play the video but damn it is annoying to do so.,What is this short movie or clip?,is this something you created or got from Adult Swim or something?,All I see is a bunch of screaming and yelling from can characters which gets repetitive and annoying.,I do like the guessing the keys and when you do press on the right one i shows up which is cool.,Overall I like the layout and design but not guess part and if you were going to make it like this please have some sort of entertaining videos so the user can enjoy once they do get the right keys.,But that is just my opinion.,I like how the intro video automatically played in fullscreen.,"The clips were pretty funny, the best, of course, being Rebecca Black.",It was pretty basic in that certain keys triggered certain clips.,My only suggestion would be to include more clips.,So far this is the most complicated patch i've seen.,It looks like there are two separate videos that will play at a time one that is triggered upon opening the patch and the others which are triggered by keys.,"It works the same way as the others, however, I think the initial video triggers the metronome for the second window.","Also, multiple keys will trigger the same video.",Conceptually I was extremely confused and maybe a little freaked out at first.,There's something disturbing about hearing children sing the Barney song while the Twilight Zone theme is playing.,It was a little confusing trying to figure out how to get out of full screen but i have a feeling that was what the user was going for.,"If that wasn't the intention, fixing that is my only suggestion.","After reading the description of the patch, I thought the fact that the patch was going to be interesting since the patch was going to start off with the Twilight Zone opening.","The way that which this patch works is similar but somewhat different, due to the fact that once the patch is loaded, the opening of the Twilight Zone would play in fullscreen.",This video starts due to the loadbang that was mentioned in the description of this patch.,"There is an entirely different video player in order to let this one play, instead of being connected to the other various clips.","Overall, there is a key object that is attached to various select objects that select the certain groups of ASCII codes that hook up to each individual video, which are activated by a metro object, a toggle, and both a Jitter QuickTime movie object and a Jitter Window object that allows the video to play in a separate window from the patch.","In order to let the video part show itself to the user, the user must ensure that the toggle is on to show the video or else just the audio would play.",There is also a subpatch that allows the user to enter fullscreen mode and exit out of fullscreen mode by clicking the ESC key.,"When I went over this patch, I actually thought that it fun to see all of the scariest videos that were in store for me.",The video choices were perfect in making me laugh and making me want to exit them as soon as I could.,"My only suggestion would be was that when I did go over your patch, I had some issues with the fullscreen mode completely taking over my computer at random intervals when I wasn't looking at the patch.","Having multiple ways to get out of this with the number keys did help, but it was an issue that I had overall.",Your over all idea was good but I couldn't view your patch because it went into full screen and wouldn't come out.,Also some of your videos wouldn't play so that was also a problem with your patch.,If you would have just watched the video cast on how to do the project again then you would have figured out all the links so you could toggle the video in and out and connect all the keys correctly.,"The patch opened automatically into presentation mode, and looked very simple.","There was a command to press a button to start, then messages came up in the max window for any unsuccessful attempts at getting the right letters typed in.","There was also a message saying you could type ""yes"" and check the max window for a hint.","The concept is fun, but this was nowhere near what was requested for the assignment.","I think this could have been improved by doing something similar, but fitting the requirements of the assignment.","The patch starts out in presentation mode with a large video window, a start button/toggle, and a prompt indicating the means through which the user can obtain the button combination to stop the videos from playing and looping.",It's an interesting concept that I have not yet seen in my other critiques.,"Going out of presentation mode shows the structure of the patch, which is actually very simple and straightforward.","The video is the MV for Destiny Child's famous song, ""Say My Name,"" which greatly motivated me in trying all different combinations before submitting and typing in the instructions for the hint; not that the song is bad, though.","It's a novel approach to creating an interactive system, one that presents a goal or purpose rather than just being what it is.","I suggest playing with the manipulation approaches to add an extra element wherein the video speed, volume, etc.",changes with the wrong button presses.,"Well, I really liked this patch because my name is Megan!","However, this patch was really nicely done.",I really enjoyed how it was interactive and made the user feel like they were talking to the patch.,"On technical level, it was really well done.",The creator made a really fun patch.,Gave me a good chuckle.,"Only thing I might have added into the patch would be an additional clip for ""say my name.""","Like maybe the breaking bad, ""say my name"" or other clips like that.",Great Job!,"The layout is very simple and easy to use, not showing the actual cords and connections.",It displays a looping video of Say My Name and will not stop until the correct sequence is typed (genius).,The author created a somewhat annoying but clever patch with a sneaky description that was the actual hint.,I thought it was a little bit weird to include the name in the description but thought nothing of it until the hint appeared.,It made me laugh because it was cleverly made to stop by the trigger of the author's name (Megan).,"I think it would be neat to have multiple songs with clever titles that would make a user have to really think about how to stop the video, but do it in stages and each new video would get progressively more obnoxious.","It looks like you ran into the same problem I did, the keys where attached to only the audio playing.",One work around is attaching the toggle to a button.,I liked the variety of music you had going.,Your full screen feature worked.,This patch was certainly amusing because you chose to focus it around such a dramatic artist such as kanye.,I like how the keys that trigger video spell out his name.,The only problem I had would be that I could not get the fullscreen effect to work.,looks simple and very spread out which helped me easily follow what went where and how it worked.,The patch was very straightforward and easy to use.,It was easy to use and had no issues.,The only suggestions I can make are to maybe make it a little bit more user friendly.,It actually took me a few seconds to find out why videos weren't playing until I saw the toggle box under a patch cable.,small things like that would be good to avoid.,"Other than that, great job!",The patch was organized and well put together and it worked like it was supposed to.,"But when I pressed the first letter, I was assaulted by a string of curses and it wasn't something I wanted or appreciated hearing.",My only suggestion is to take into consideration the people who will be watching the video clips.,As a user this patch just made me uncomfortable.,The patcher looks really detailed and well set up.,The patch itself worked like a charm.,"All buttons did as advertised, esc key worked, and I liked that he had some caption there.",It was helpful.,I liked the basketball theme.,It was unique and I enjoyed the videos.,Great presentation.,I like the way you hooked up your metro toggle to the space bar giving me the ability to view frame by frame.,I liked the music and videos.,Your patcher works as it is supposed to.,Your patch was very clean and worked great!,You chose great hoopmixtape videos and you used them well.,No problems with the patch at all.,Very well done!,You only used the home row keys but there is nothing wrong with that!,great work,I really liked the theme of the video.,I feel like it could be used on an ESPN website or something.,"That being said, I was a little confused with the description you provided.","In the patch, it was unclear which basketball players were making a name for themselves and those who were not.",The overall feel of the patch was very easy to navigate.,"After reading the description to your patch, I knew that I was going to watching various clips of a concert that would correspond to each key.",The way that which this patch works is similar to that of the patch that which we were introduced to.,"There is a key object that is attached to various select objects that select the certain ASCII codes that hook up to each individual video, which are activated by a metro object, a toggle, and both a Jitter QuickTime movie object and a Jitter patcher window that would play the video inside of the patch itself.","In order to let the video part show itself to the user, the user must ensure that the toggle is on to show the video or else just the audio would play.","There are also various messages attach to the Jitter QuickTime movie that help stop, start, and clear the video.",I thought that it was interesting that the video itself played in the patch and there was no separate window or subpatch that allowed the videos to play in fullscreen mode.,"The messages did help with the video, yet, I feel as though the read and clear messages are not necessary to let this patch run.",My initial impression of the patch is that it is a little messy.,"It's nothing terribly unruly, and this opinion may just stem from my tendency to like things as streamlined and easy to follow as possible - do don't worry too much about it, you can probably ignore it.","Upon further inspection, I noticed that the patch doesn't have a fullscreen option, which I assumed was part of the assignment criteria.","I think fullscreen would have really benefitted the overall experience when using this patch because the material was a concert with flashing lights and such, which would have looked pretty cool in a larger window than provided.",Another suggestion I have is to use keys that are either easy to remember or that are in order on the keyboard - possibly from left to right.,"With your patch, the videos appeared to be in order and continuous together, so using a row of keys probably would make it easier to use.","Looking back at your description, this might not be the case, but I'm not familiar with his music, so my mistake.",I really enjoyed this patch because the music selection is awesome!,Alpha keys are assigned to buttons that will trigger a specific video.,The design of the patch is not complex and is easy to control.,I believe the patch is perfectly fine the way it is.,There doesn't seem to be anything that hinders the performance of the patch.,Great job!,"With this patch, no longer will I have to go to concerts.",All I need now are those braclets and some swagger.,"This is a cool concept, and the live sets actually are refreshing.",Most people wouldn't think of doing something like that.,"The concept is simple, but it is effectively used by you.","Pretty much everything works technical wise besides the ""clear"" button.",I am not sure what that is supposed to do as it doesn't clear anything I can see visually.,"Also, I wish you could've included a button to make it full screen so I can enjoy these house sets at my house.",This is still a good patch though.,So the theme is like montage of movie trailers?,Because all these movies do not have anything in common.,It must of took a lot of time finding these clips because they are all from different movies.,The patch is simple but you are missing the stop and play keys which is important because I cannot stop this while I am critiquing your patch!,"Your ""I"" key does not play any file it must be a dud?",You could of changed to screen size to a larger one when it is in full screen because most of these clips are obviously in bigger resolution sizes.,I like what you are going for but should of tried to keep the theme the same instead of a montage of random trailers.,The only thing that was bugging me was that there are no stop and play keys!,The layout of the patch is simple enough to play the clips which was good.,Upon opening the patch the first thing one would notice are the two rows of giant bang messages with their corresponding letters commented inside.,The rest of the patch structure is set up just like the typical model.,What the user can do is play a movie trailer by pressing one of the identified buttons and then begin a new one by pressing another; this is a very fun idea as it allows users to cycle around different trailers to create their own ridiculous trailers.,I had quite a bit of fun messing around with different letter combinations to create some goofy scenes.,"I suggest testing out, if there are, commands that can stop and record the places of movie clips so that it does not restart every time its keyboard button is pressed.",The concept in itself was very interesting.,"The patch looked well and worked well, except one of the keys (I) wasn't playing.","Great concept, and the patch looked simple enough when opened.","However, none of the videos played after turning the toggle on.",I like the way your patcher looks.,nicely laid out.,I noticed that there weren't any video files in your zip folder when I opened it.,"As I suppected, no files, no video.",Opened patch to find eight large buttons linked to videos that did not play back and a large jitter window inside the patch.,"The full screen function worked but since there was nothing loaded for me to watch I was left going back through the process of opening it, checking to see where the video files might be and finally realizing that the original zip only included the patch but no folder with the video clips in it.",Considering the point of this project was to view movie clips it was definitely a letdown not being able to view any.,I felt bad for whoever created this patch because at least there was a title 'cool guys don't look at explosions' which implies there was a conceptual them that may have added some weight to the project.,"Please try to be mindful of including all the relevant files with your zip, its a shame to know hard work was done but fell though because a last minute lack of attention.",Your patch was very easy to work and to read.,I am confused why you don't have a stop button which was really annoying when I didn't want to watch the videos any more.,The content of the videos was cool but all the people talking was really annoying and I would rather just watch scenes from the video games.,The letters you chose to render the videos was also random and I wish they had more intention next time.,The work is about Super Smash Bros (a video game) where a bunch of people go crazy about the characters and the fights.,"The patch is easy to use, flip on the qmetro and press different keys to see reactions to the video game.",The author created a compilation of what I think is the weirdest thing to spazz out about but I guess everyone has something.,"It made me feel stunned that people actually were super excited for this, especially the character Megaman (even though he is awesome), it's crazy to think people sit and wait for trailers such as this.","It was pretty humorous to watch but I think it would have been funnier to have shorter clips, like cut to the part where they announce megaman and then have the keys be the people react with the 2 second ""wahh"" ""oh shhhhh*t"" stuff.","The design is really simple, you cannot see how the patch works at first glance because everything is hidden.",It gives the patch a very easy to understand and simplistic look.,I'm actually not sure how to look inside the patch because it's pretty well hidden but I think it works basically the same as the others with keys triggering videos to play.,Conceptually I loved the  themes and I loved how one clip would play if you didn't press the right key.,"However, I couldn't see the videos!",So that would be my suggestion for improvement.,All I heard were sounds and no videos popped up.,I like how simple it is.,Only a few buttons makes it super easy to understand.,"I noticed the ""uh huh honey"" clip was used for a few different clips and it was already looping within each so that made it a little much.",This patch is my favorite lol.,UH HUH HONEY!,hilarious that you designated that to multiple keys.,Love the way you have the patch setup; very easy to follow.,All the videos are compressed perfectly and run smooth.,Not much I would suggest to improve this patch except maybe incorporate fullscreen?,But then again the videos are so short it probably wouldn't be worth it.,The zip file is only 10.3MB which is awesome!,"When first looking at this patch it is very aesthetically pleasing and simple to use with two buttons, start and stop and some instructions.",The patch worked well with a lot of keys connecting to a lot of different video clips.,The only thing that I didn't like was that every other key press played this one short video clip and it was kind of annoying to see and hear over and over again.,My suggestion would be to only use as many keys as you have videos then just specify which keys to use so that you don't have a bunch of keys linked to the same video clip.,"The patch looks nice, and clean, however the video that you picked can be more creative and have more variety, also some video got a delay at the beginning.","I think this project can be better if you use ""Loadbang"" to start putting everything in fullscreen, and pick the group of videos that kinda tell a story.",This patch is very clean and organized and well done.,You used a basic project to do but it works well and it looks great.,Very funny videos and It was fun to watch.,I kind of like how you didn't go all out and try some huge thing and use all of the keys like everyone else.,great job,This patcher had numerous videos that were all trigger by pressing a certain key.,"I liked the patch because it was neat and very easy to follow, and it also had a common theme which is a nice aspect to a project like this.",There was also ease of use due to the notes that the created added into the patch which made things more understandable.,"This patch could be made even better with values that could alter the videos, such as volume or fast forwarding but overall a very nice job.",I like the clips  and that the patch was really just a big button and that you have it so it spells a certain phrase.,When I first started typing i was expecting for one clip to kind of smoothly transition into the next so they'd all be connected that way.,but that could be an idea for next time.,Nice job,"First of all, who is that girl on ""L""?",She's cute.,"I also noticed that there is a Justin Bieber doppleganger on the ""I"" letter.","The patch itself though is pretty cool, I forgot to press the 'Esc' key and heard the songs and thought I was going to see the Dance Dance Revolution game.",The idea itself became clearer once i pressed it.,"I like this patch a lot, it's fun and intricate.","You used various videos, which I found funny but cool at the same time.","There were different speeds and tempos for the videos, which I liked.",This is a really good concept that is used effectively and does justice.,"Upon opening the patch, I got a similar vibe to a critique I did on the last max project, probably due tot eh simple overlay.",Butthe patch does work pretty good and it does have instructions so you know how to work it.,The patch's purpose was to make the key's play different songs and it really made me want to rock.,"I will say for the instructions mayve give instructions on typing the individual keys rather than the whole words, it made me feel lost on that regard.","But overall, I liked it.","The patch plays eleven videos, using alpha keys that spell out a memorable phrase.","Technically, it's an expanded version of the example patch from class.","Conceptually, I think it's meant to entertain and to excite, as each video highlights bold dancing technique.","The patch might have been made better using a number of similar videos, or videos which seem to support a common style or theme.",The patch was very nicely done because it had pretty colors and didn't look like an ordinary patch because of the easy to look at interface.,There were two big buttons to start the video reading process and the actual video.,It was very fun and easy going similar to the video which was an Old Spice commercial.,Maybe for improvement put less comments on the interface since there were too many places to look at.,Combine all the comments into a list or procedure for easy viewing and quick understanding.,This was a great patch I think.,User used a graphic and assumed I knew how to look behind it.,I didn't know how so I could only use for face value.,The patch had instructions however I became confused when the B button would start or stop another window an enter fullscreen.,I found myself with one behind the other.,I will give this a good score simply because I am ignorant of how to use it.,"When I opened the patch, it was a little all over the place but it worked just fine.","From what I could see in the patch, the creator used a lot of framing instead of clips, which is why I think the file size was so big.",The patch worked very smoothly for me.,I will admit it was fun hit the keys repetitively to make the player ram into each other.,I would have recommended making small clips of the main video and maybe using a presentation for the patch.,Overall nice job!,The video jumps to different frames of the video via key press.,The patch was messy and could've been arranged much better.,"Due to the way the patch is structured, the video will just continue playing until the end of the clip, and I am uncertain if that was the intention of the piece.",The patch had a cool NHL theme (which is pretty rare to find in this major) and was very neat and organized.,"Instead of the way most people had their patches where they played different video clips, this patch had only one long clip and the different keys triggered what frame the video started on.","It also featured an autostart, which I have yet to see in any of my critiques thus far!",I really enjoyed this refreshing patch as well as watching some crazy hockey hits.,Good job!,The patch appears to be set up properly.,"It looked a little too crazy, maybe it could be a little more tamed.",The patch worked perfectly.,Each key of the S-L played a different hockey video.,"It was really cool, it was a smooth process and the overall quality was wonderful.",I am just one who likes to decorate and pretty up the patch but thats just me because its still an awesome program.,A quality.,Very nice patch.,Having to spell out complete words before it would play was cool and something i hadn't seen/thought of.,It simple and works well.,nice job,"Your patch is a baseball themed one, with some unique clips that show.","I like how you include videos of funny or amazing things happening instead of rudimentary stuff, given that I have to spell out each one, which is interesting to me.","Everything works fine technically, i got the menu to disappear and reappear with ease.",Everything else plays perfectly whenever I typed a certain word is.,"I loved the ""ejection"" one too.","It was a creative patch, in total.",I felt visually this piece was very organized and straightforward in terms of functionality.,I also like that you took it a step further and programmed the actually word of the baseball clip you wanted the viewer to use as opposed to just a simple key.,Following the simple commands on the right side of the patch allow you to choose specific words to type in and activate that video clip.,"I have played softball the majority of my life and definitely enjoy baseball, therefore, I really liked the compilation of the baseball action clips you choose.","I know how difficult it is trying to find the right footage to narrow down, so I can understand why the quality of the footage may not have been exactly what you wanted.",The only improvement I can think of is just finder higher quality footage.,"DescriptionThis patch allows the user to preview eight MTV Hot Videos with the 1-8 keys on the keyboard.","Technical analysisWhen the user presses a key, it loads a corresponding video into the jit video player- pressing the space bar sends the stop message.","Conceptual analysisYes!",This author expertly organizes the patch into a very user friendly and well designed experience.,"I can't tell you how much scrolling was necessary for other projects because they left the ""vertical"" nature of Max intact.","The author clearly understands how to consider not only their audience, but also how their audience will be able to view the piece, and creates a very pleasing way to watch cool videos.","SuggestionThere is nothing wrong with the patch, but I think the author is able to take this piece even further, aesthetically.","For example, you could use the fpic object to include a picture of the album cover that the songs are from, and arrange it similar to cover flow on iTunes.","For this format, the possibilities are almost endless.",I like how this patch is organized and they layout.,The theme is obviously about music samples from top hit bands and singers.,Its good that you did not input the entire music video which would of been very long.,The patch however did not have a play key but does have a stop key which is odd?,Also there is no full screen at all which is a must because that is one of the requirement for this assignment.,At least the preview screen is big enough for a clear picture.,Overall good patch but missing one of the key element which is the full screen and the play key.,Make sure to include important keys in there next time.,"Patch opens in presentation mode with black background, jitter window, clear instructions and 8 music videos clips that can be selected using the numeric keys.",Space bar is used to stop playback.,"Black background with white lettering makes it easy to read and aesthetically pleasing, videos are short but just enough to get an idea of the song and the music selection is fun while the visuals are interesting.","This is a strong piece and well thought out, my main criticism is that I couldn't get the pop up window to go full screen.","Also, it may have been cool to have the space bar be able to resume playback as well as stopping it.",Your patch was very funny.,"My favorite clip was the ""fishy time"" one.",I also liked your layout and content.,I thought it was great how you developed your idea beyond videos switching and into a game.,This patch has a lot more attention to detail for patch appearance and look.,The patch also functions properly as the videos are triggered when certain keys are pressed.,The game-approach to this patch definitly made it a little more worth while to check out the whole patch rather than testing the same old patch over and over.,Great patch!,I like how you used the panel wall to hide all the patch cords and such from the user.,This is something I need to do more frequently when building patches.,Maybe next time you can use a [loadbang] object so the toggles and start buttons load on their own.,"I enjoyed the clips you used, they were appropriate lengths.",I think you have a great presentation and you completed the project well.,Good work!,"Of note, I think all of these videos are somewhat creepy, it's difficult for me to decipher exactly which one you are talking about.","The first thing that struck me about this patch was the simple layout and cleanness of the design, you aren't distracted by how the patch is made.","There isn't anything fancy being done here, and the idea of making this patch into a game is great.",The videos are all entertaining and fun to watch.,By hiding the rest of the patch with just a panel is a great way to hide the technical stuff but still giving the user a way to see it without having to search.,"Overall I really liked this patch, great job!","When I downloaded your patch, I noticed it only had one video.","I wasn't sure what was going to happen but once I played it, I knew.","Even though you only had 1 anime video, it was still done technically sound and nicely.",The only thing I could've wished for is more videos with this project.,"It could've included some other anime videos or more for this specific show but instead, it only has one which leaves me feeling empty.","I am not sure if you were hurrying, but it just needed a little more value with it.",This patch looks identical to the one that was presented to us in class.,I didn't feel like pressing every key on the keyboard to decide what key is ASCII 103 so I just pushed the button to get the video to start.,In the future you might want to specify what key will trigger video playback.,But at least the basic idea was followed.,"I'd like to see more videos in the future and since you have the messages for rate and such, maybe make keys that will trigger those to vary.",This patch was very nicely done.,It had a very simple patch without much complicated wires or connections.,"The video also worked when I pressed the ""b"" button and the full screen option also worked.",The patch looked spread out and simple but the video was so intense so I didn't think it matched the concept.,"However, it was good path.",Maybe an improvement could be to use panel object and make the patch a bit more colorful or presentation mode?,"DescriptionThis patch plays a clip from an anime when the ""g"" key is pressed.","Technical analysisThe key object listens for a key press, and when the ""g"" key is pressed, begins playing a video clip.","Conceptual analysisThis patch is very simple, there is not a lot of concept behind this execution, unless I'm completely missing the significance of the anime clip, or something.","SuggestionThis patch is a good jumping off point for this project.",One of the suggestions I made numerous times in this crit is to use the loadbang object on the toggle for the qmetro so that the user doesn't need to do it manually.,"Don't be afraid to really dig into the patches that Tinapple gives us- I noticed that some of the objects that he included for demonstration purposes (like the rate, time and frame messages) weren't utilized in the patch and could be omitted.","Also, please let the user know, with a comment or message of some kind, what needs to be done to use the patch.","I had to hunt for the key with the value ""103"", and that took away from the experience.",The patcher was well built and was easy to understand.,It made me feel entertained through the use of fighting anime video clips.,"The alpha keys triggered a specific anime cut scene, and the design was fairly organized.","I recommend tidying up the design, though.",There are a few objects you could simplify by connecting to other objects.,"Other than that, the project was a success!","The patch reads key presses and sent bangs to buttons, then on to frame messages, and finally to a jit.qt.movie.",This patch is unique in that it is using a single movie file and the keys move to selected spots in the file.,The author definitely spent some time figuring out the timing for each delay to avoid the movie running over into the next letter.,"Also, that pic in the background is great.",The patch looks great.,I love the picture in the background.,I don't really understand your concept though.,I've never seen the movie Vampire Kiss though I do agree that it can be exasperating and time consuming to work in Max.,"Still, everything worked smoothly.",The only thing i would suggest it fine tuning the cut off points for the clips.,"like I said, I've never seen the movie so I don't know if the clips could have been separated any better but sometimes you really couldn't tell what he was shouting.",The only way to know was to pay attention to what key you were pressing.,Other than that great job.,This patch is hilarious.,Definitely a cool concept I enjoyed going through the entire alphabet.,Really cool how you got the N-cage background pic.,You gotta show me how to do that!,"When opening the patch looked almost identical to the one used in the lecture and for the most part, the patch worked well but there were problems upon the playback settings.","The patch was made to play a simple video, namely the AMV that the author chose to use, and it was something to jam to.","I think what would help it to put down read, and then the name of the movie so that we don't have to manually open it all the time.",But it was pretty good nonetheless.,for Key 5 it says press to decrease play rate when it actually speeds it up.,Not sure what key 4 does.,You prolly should have closed and opened it up again to check if it all works before you submitted.,It was an interesting patch though.,Sub Patch would help with organization swell.,I couldn't get the patch to play.,I wish I could find out what video you had chosen.,"The patch only had one video, but it did respond to keys.","It does somewhat seem like the author of the patch chose just to use an example David used in lecture for the jit.qt.movie object, attaching key strokes to the parameters of one video.",I would perhaps suggest using more than one video.,This was a nice and simply patcher.,It was created so that I could stop and start the video with number keys making the patch mouseless.,I enjoyed the videos.,The patched was clean and worked well.,"The patch has a nice layout and hides which button plays which video, making it a surprise.",The videos are all funny and entertaining.,"The only suggestion I have would be to hide all of the wiring instead of just the videokeys, and maybe decorate it in some way.",Overall it works well and is easy to understand.,"The patch was laid out nicely, and was very well constructed.","You can see where everything was connected, and there was a little description to give the user an idea of what key to press to get a certain video played.","The videos were either amusing or very funny, and it made hitting the next key fun since you didn't know what was going to pop up next.","Overall, it was very well made, and the only thing I can think of to improve on is maybe using a back drop to hide all the ""behind-the-scenes"".","Other than that, it's a fun patch to play around with.",This patch is very clean and organized and well done.,You used a basic project to do but it works well and it looks great.,Very funny videos and It was fun to watch.,I kind of like how you didn't go all out and try some huge thing and use all of the keys like everyone else.,my only suggestion was it was hard to know what keys pushed what.,"maybe if you labeled them something as simple as ""k"" or something.",but well done.,"I hadn't seen quite of a few of the videos included in this patch, so I found it to be refreshing and really amusing to cycle through.",I like that you chose a topic with a more personal connection.,"I can imagine you showing this to your friends and having a bunch of fun with it, which is really cool.",The patch itself was fairly simplistic and organized pretty well.,"One thing I might suggest would be to condense the patch as much as you can so it doesn't take up a lot of area on the workspace - if created on a large display, smaller displays will have a lot of stuff cut off.","This was a problem for me when trying to view everything within the patch, placing everything in the top-lefthand corner is usually a good rule, I've noticed.","Other than that visual aspect, everything else was done nicely.",The use of sub-patches for each video definitely allowed you to make things a lot more streamlined in appearance.,"I did notice there were three key objects used, one(maybe two) would have done the job.",Good work!,That is quite a funny theme.,The work takes a user through a comedic youtube video using different inputs on the keyboard.,The author made a very entertaining sketch.,It would be cool if the videos were pieced together.,So maybe a video clip would begin as soon as its predecessor ends.,This of course was not required for the assignment.,Patch was well designed and easy to follow.,"Video clips were hilarious, but I feel they could have been cut a little cleaner.",It's a pretty basic press-to-play.,Would've been nice to not have had to manually start the metro though.,"The patch was pretty straight forward, assigning keys to different video clips.","I really enjoyed the clips, they were pretty funny.","I would suggest cutting the clips more to the rhythm so they loop more seamlessly, making the overall body of clips run together more smoothly if one wants to change the videos on time with the song.",Simple patch based off the example in class.,Functions properly.,Could have been labeled.,"The patch is designed to play three videos with a similar theme upon pressing nine keys, with three of each mapped to one video.","Technically, it's similar to the example patch made in class, but it uses more keys and the ""p esc-fullscreen"" subpatcher is connected to the wrong object.","Conceptually, the patch is designed to make the user laugh by pairing a parody video with two sincere videos which seem to be connected to the inspiration behind the parody.","The patch would be a lot better if the creator had properly used the ""p esc-fullscreen"" subpatcher, as I was unable to enter fullscreen mode while using this patch.","First, I would like to say I enjoyed how you made this project personal.",I did notice the esc full screen did not work.,But that was a tricky one to figure out.,One way I would have improved this assignment is through using a button to activate the start & the toggle.,I too did not want 8 different videos in mine and had a hard time meeting the limit and making the project simple.,But I did like the content of the videos.,This patch is great in that it offers much more control over the video including a way to fast forward or rewind or play the video at different speeds.,Everything worked perfectly although it was a lot of buttons to remember and I had to quit out of fullscreen mode to check what the keys were again.,"The videos themselves were fun with lots of bright colors and upbeat music, they were really long though.",I know they were music videos but I don't think most people will take the time to watch them all the way through.,My suggestion would be to take a clip of your favorite part from each song and use just that instead,"The simplicity in the patch, as stated worked in favor of it.","Everything worked and sounded fine, and the patch was easy to understand.","Of course, the video's quality wasn't that great, but that's due to YouTube in itself.",Looks complicated but neat.,I like the layout because it is easy to follow.,The patch works very well and had no issues.,I liked it a lot and was well thought out.,The videos were also incredibly entertaining.,The only suggestion I could make is to flip the top and the bottom of the patch.,By that I mean put the preview window at the top along with the directions.,"That way they are the first things you see, rather than the other things that the user doesnt really need to see to use the patch.","Other than that, great job!",I really liked your layout.,Also the videos were interesting and I liked how they went together.,In terms of your patch I thought It was very well made and it was simple and worked well.,"I think that for next time since your content is extremely colorful, it would be awesome if your patch matched the scenes from the video.",Basic Jitter window with the addition of two trigger keys; one linked to a video that plays inside the patch and the other connected to a movie that plays in a pop up window.,"Both videos were clips are from video games and can play at the same time, one inside the patch and the other in the pop up window.",There were no instructions as to what order to do things and it took me a minute to work out what was what.,The metronomes for both patches had to be turned on to view videos.,I was expecting to be able to switch between videos in the pop up and think that could have been of benefit to this piece.,Some notes or instructions are always welcome.,The layout was at least tidy but I did feel that this piece could have used some extra attention to make it stand out just a little more.,I really liked your lecture patch.,"It didn't really make me feel anything though, but it did grab my attention.","It works very good, very easy to understand.","I'd probably just make the patch look cleaner and more organized, and use some type of graphics to make it stand out.","Also it was basic, so maybe some more files next time.","But still, it worked, so good job.",Had a little difficulty maneuvering around the patch.,Could have been labeled.,"Although the patch does function, I believe there were supposed to be eight keys assigned.",The patch worked well and looked well.,"However, there were only two keys that triggered the videos.","But overall, it was aesthetically pleasing and worked.",The visual appearance of the patch is clean and well organized to make the user experience effortless.,There are eight designated buttons that activate the scare scam videos with the full screen option.,It thought this was one of the most entertaining patches that I reviewed.,The approach you choose to pick comical quotes definitely worked.,If you wanted to add another dimension alternating the videos by speed or some other effect could take it to the next level.,"Very comical though, good job!","The patch reads key presses and sent bangs to buttons, and from there to read messages into a jit.qt.movie.","The videos were some of my favorites in all of the patches I looked at, especially #6.","In the future if you would like your patch to open in presentation mode by default, look under view->Patcher Inspector (or Shift + Cmd + i).","The green toggle was a helpful way for me to quickly find where I should be going to get everything started, it's something I haven't seen in other patches.",Overall a great job.,This one was pretty entertaining.,You did the basic assignment and chose some funny scare cam clips.,"My only suggestion would be to edit the clips a bit more closely so you can't tell they are all cut from the same video, one clip after another.",Other than that I liked the patch.,The little kid screaming as he's opening the door is probably my favorite.,"The patch was a great movie player triggered by video keys that used 1-8, and oddly enough was the only patch that used those keys!","When put into presentation mode, it looked like a mini movie theater and made it very fun to watch and helped put the viewer ""in the mood"" for what they were about to witness (which just happened to be scare vines).",They all worked very well!,"And due to how short the video clips were, the folder was a mere 2 megabytes, which was great.","The only thing I'd suggest is maybe add color, but honestly that's not much of a big deal.",It was very good!,The patch was super nice.,"It was organized really well, I really liked how the presentation mode looked.","Technically it worked great, everything ran smoothly.",The patch was extremely fun to watch and play over again!,Only thing I can think to make better is auto fullscreen.,Great job!,Pretty simple approach to the assignment; everything looks good in the patch.,Unfortunately I can't seem to get the dbz video to play when I strike the H key.,Compression looks good for the twinkies video though!,I would suggest getting more videos in as you are only at 16MB right now.,You could assign some more keys to more videos or even make some phrases that would initiate specific dragon ball Z events!,Like Kamehameha :),The patch could have been a little more cleaned up but it appears to have all the right technical functions.,Neither of the buttons worked for me and I am on a mac so that may explain it.,I had to manually hit both buttons with my mouse but only the first button played not the 'H'.,The clips were funny but I could not get it on ESC.,I believe this patch has real potential but it is not meant for macs.,There are a lot of keys and element missing in this patch.,It looked like you just threw everything together in the last minute.,There are only two keys on the patch and only one works.,and I could only played two videos; the minion and DBZ clips?,and from your description it worked well on the windows and not mac which clearly shows it too.,This patch did not load up everything.,Make sure that if you are going to work with windows that it works well with mac also because we Mac users in this class.,The patch did not load up all the requirements needed so I cannot critique much but please make sure it does work next time with both OS if you are creating it on windows.,This patch was very easy to read and to work.,I was able to see the minions clip but not the Muhammad one.,"Also, the assignment was to make 8 keys that played different videos and because you didn't have that I didn't find your clip very interesting.",I think the minion video is cute but because you didn't have more videos and your patch didn't toggle in and out of full screen I don't think it was very interesting.,Very simple and straight forward.,It plays eighteen different clips (looping) corresponding to different keys on the keyboard.,"The buttons are not labeled, so the user has to hunt to find what buttons do things.",//edit: (I later found the note at the top saying what keys it is.),"Before clicking any buttons to play the clip, the qmetro does NOT need to be toggled, so the video can be played.",There is a load bang.,It works well.,It is very minimal and user friendly.,I did not know about the load bang.,That was very helpful.,"The clips are very funny, so yes Ryan, I do think this is funny.",The mechanics of it are not particularly interesting since it only plays videos.,"But, I did think it was very cool that you use load bang.",I did not know that existed.,My first thought when I opened this patch is how impressive it was.,There definitely was some time put into this piece and the intricacies of the piece are demonstrated through the visual components of the piece in terms of design and conceptual analysis.,"The level of work demonstrated in this piece far exceeds my skill level in max, therefore, I really do not have any suggestions on improvements.",This was by far the best piece I viewed in terms of conceptuality and technical design/functionality.,"I also found myself laughing through the clips, great selection and timing on videos.",Great work!,"A little scary, but amusing!",Everything functions and the patch is organized.,I just felt everything could have been labeled better towards instructions of operating the patch.,At first glance it looked good and well organized.,"When I started using it, I noticed instantly that there was a lot of Ryan Gosling, but that's besides the point.","Overall, the patch worked very well and was very straightforward.",It worked very well and I had no problems with it.,Great Job!,The team is trying to achieve a modern short story.,"In that, I mean formats that are common in today's communications.",The Research and Inspiration section of the proposal is the strongest and most thought through section.,"It shows the background they have based their premise on and where they want to take their work, citing references for both.",This section also gives a valid argument for the choice of a short story format for the assignment.,The outline needs some work.,This section does not sound interesting or intriguing at all.,"The sections on each side, the summary and research and inspiration, make this work different.",The outline however makes it sound like so many short stories already on the market.,The team will have a challenge making a short story format entice and pull in the reader yet be different and modern at the same time.,A short story has limited time and space to make all this work.,"Per Edgar Allan Poe's theory of singularity, a work should be readable in 30 minutes to 2 hours at the most.","With this thought in mind, the team has a challenge in front of them.",The team aims to achieve a reader based outcome story for their project.,"The greatest strength of this proposal is the outline, it takes you quickly and easily through the concept.","The summary is also done well by giving a basis, ""a fan-fiction story,"" and an explanation while the outline builds on this.",The research and inspiration needs work.,"It is confusing and nothing but quotes, barely explaining why the works are used.","The confusion comes from the use of ""Jaws"" instead of what I believe should be Ludovician.","Another gap that needs filling is a work cited list, there is none.","The challenge I see with the execution will be all the links, videos and pictures.","Making sure the links work properly and if using videos and pictures from other sources, making sure there is no copyright and citing them properly.",This project attempts to change the history of one person in a format unstated.,The proposal is thorough and well thought out with great detail and research.,This proposal was written by one person about one person.,The division of labor indicates a group and if this is so then this proposal does not meet the guidelines of the assignment.,There is also no work cited listed.,There is a lot of time to cover in this proposal and even using the group it would be a monumental task but by oneself I do not see it being completed in time.,"This group will achieve a new and exciting format of the book, they hope.","This proposal is well written as a whole, thoroughly researched and well planned.",The sections move smoothly from one to the next building on the idea stated in the summary.,The only thing I see missing is a work cited list.,TIme is going to be an issue with these gentlemen.,With what they are describing there will be a lot of links between the three storylines that need to be verified and perfected.,A choose-you-own-adventure type of story.,"The reader can choose to read all, some, or one of the narratives.",Lots of detail.,"Almost too much, but the point/idea gets across well.",The research/inspiration section for the fathers' POV does not list research materials outside of the author's personal experiences.,It also does not tell us what format/type of narrative will be used.,Only the section about the daughter tells us how the story will be a future book.,No works referenced section.,"Writing, editing, and compiling three different stories, each at least 2k words, then putting all of them together in Twine by the deadline.","A non-linear progression of the main character time traveling to ""fix"" his live.","Thorough outline of the story, good examples of research/inspiration.",Division of labour needs to be thought through.,It sounds like the other members of the group either were not consulted or were unavailable for collaboration prior to the submission deadline.,No works referenced section.,Communicating with the other group members and collaborating on a project they were not initially part of.,Engage the reader in the story using a quiz-like approach.,This sounds so fun.,I like choose your own adventure stories and love the quizzes on BuzzFeed and it sounds like this is the best of both.,Use of second person POV adds to the uniqueness.,"Fantastic arguments in the inspiration/research section, very clean.",The Summary and the first section of the Outline are repetitive.,"Building 8 scenarios for each section of the story, creating macros, etc, might be time consuming.",The reader will be able to see into the lives of two men who have different home lives.,"We will be able to see their similarities, differences, and how each wants what the other has.","I like the convergent/divergent storyline idea, where the characters intersect and break apart again, giving the reader a broader view of the world being created in the story.","Good use of non-traditional/digital inspirations, especially since this is a ""future"" book.","Works referenced (in MLA format) section missing, some grammar and punctuation errors make the proposal confusing at times.","While I love the idea for the potential for endless parallel stories (the barista, co-workers, etc) it could get bogged down if too many secondary characters get their own stories.",The group seems to be putting together a story that the reader decides and narrates himself.,"It seems like the group has an awesome ""idea"" and they know exactly how they are going to tackle writing their rough draft of the assignment.","I loved how they already know the different characters that the readers will choose from and that their final project has a purpose:  to answer the question ""What kind of nerd are you?""","It seems as though quite a bit of work has been done already, even in putting together the proposal.",I'm eager to read this group's final project!,"I think that this group has a great ""idea"", but I see it being difficult to carry out.","It seems that the purpose is for the reader to become the narrator, which I can't imagine tackling.",It seems like a ton of work and I just hope that this group knows the amount of work that they've signed themselves up for.,"Other than that, it seems like a solid proposal and that the workload is divvied up fairly.","Like I said above, I just hope that this group has enough time to get the project done.",It seems like they chose a quite an intense way to tell their story and that they have a similarly intense workload ahead.,I just hope that they have enough time to accomplish their narrative and do it well!,It seems as though this group will be writing a fictional story of two men who live parallel to one another and fantasize about the life choices of the other.,It seems like a great idea that can easily hit the 2000 word count requirement!,It seems like the basic storyline has been decided and this group knows exactly how they're going to tell their story.,"I love their story idea and feel like they'll be able to blow through this assignment fairly quickly while still having to finish ""The Raw Shark Texts"" this week.",They were smart in choosing their topic and feel like they will actually be able to enjoy writing this paper!,It doesn't seem like this group needs much critique.,"They were thoughtful in putting together their proposal, which will make writing their story simple.",They put in the work on the front end so they will be able write freely this week and will easily be able to put together a story that hits the 2000 word count requirement.,"If anything, I think that their biggest struggle will be that two different group me members are writing the two stories of the two men separately.","It would probably turn out more perfectly if one group member wrote the story of both men so the writing style stayed the same and the stories made sense ""together"".",I think that the fact that they've decided to complete the assignment separately will give them the most trouble.,"As stated above, I feel like the fact that two different people writing the two stories of the two men will give them the most trouble.","I feel like they should either write the stories together (like via FaceTime or Skype) so they can brainstorm and work through it together, or that only one group member should write the story lines of both men and then the other group members work through the rough draft and make changes.",I feel that the stories will make more sense and flow so much better if only one group member actually writes the rough drafts of them.,"No matter what way you end up doing this, I wish you guys luck and am eager to read your final assignment!","It seems as though this group is aiming to writing a fan fiction piece based on a required text for the class ""The Raw Shark Texts"" through the eyes of Eric Sanderson's girlfriend Clio Ames.",The reader of the project will chose Clio's path through the story by making decisions for her by having a choice of links throughout the final project.,It seems as though this group has a solid plan of action and has divided the work fairly amongst the group members.,"I feel like after reading the other groups' proposals, this one seems the least creative to me.",The proposal isn't as thorough as the rest of the groups' proposals and I have a feeling that it will be hard for this group to hit the 2000 word count requirement.,I feel like this group didn't put in as much time on the front end of this assignment as the other groups and will struggle through the assignment this week as a result.,"I also think that it will be a struggle to ""write the paper together"" as it seems they plan on doing.",This group has their work cut out for them this week and I only wish them luck!,"As stated above, I worry that this group will have a hard time with their project this week.","I feel like because they've decided to just ""write the story together"", it won't flow nicely and the different group members' writing styles will clash.",I feel like their grade will suffer in the end because they've chosen to complete the project in this fashion.,"It seems as though this group is writing a story that the reader will navigate through, that the reader will chose the outcome of the story himself.","It seems as though this group sufficiently thought through this assignment, that they've divided the work fairly amongst the group members and they've decided on the readers' story options within their text.",This will make writing their final assignment much so much easier than if they hadn't already done this!,I feel like it may be a challenge for this group to hit the 2000 word count requirement.,"They only have a basic outline of their story, whereas some of the other groups have been much more detailed in how their stories will develop.","Like I said above, I feel like this group needs to come up with more detailed outline before they begin to write their portion of the assignment separately.",It will only help them to all stay on track and for their final assignment submission to flow smoothly.,I feel like they will be able to write the assignment so much more quickly and smoothly if they do this first.,"The outcome will consist of unifying two strangers with one single thought at the end, further implying that two completely different men can have the same worries, regrets, and dissatisfactions within their very different lives.","Hopefully, this outcome will also be both surprising and rewarding to the reader, who will feel that there has been a bigger message within the two stories.","This is a unique idea, and its biggest strength is in its very clear outline.",Having that much detail will make the project much easier to pull off.,"I wouldn't say there are any gaps, but I wonder if Andrew's subplot story-writing is really necessary considering the bulk of the stories will be relatively simple.","Constructing the story sounds like the most difficult part, and hopefully will be done as a team rather than left up to one person.",This is where the outline will need further definition.,"I'm not entirely sure what the outcome is supposed to be, except that this will be a new experimental type of book.","I'm guessing the achievement will lie in entertaining and surprising the reader, and I think that's definitely going to happen if executed well.",The amount of inspiration and research going into the project--and the texts that were chosen--are really great.,Leaping off of these will surely result in something fantastic.,"The outline seems very, very bare.","And while it does indicate a different type of book, perhaps something profoundly minimal, I still wonder if the outline is truly descriptive enough to hold the process together if artist's block comes.","Making this on Twine seems like a big challenge, as it can't just be a point and click thing, like flipping pages on a book.","There needs to be some sort of design, a maze, or course that the book follows.",This project will create a quiz/game environment where the reader is addressed directly and led through a series of questions.,"Depending on their answers, the reader will then learn what actor/book character they are.","The ""interruptible"" aspect of the book and its choices lends to its uniqueness, making it seem less like an online quiz and more like a new sort of personality test.","Because this should still be considered a book, I feel that it's lacking a real outline.","Will the questions involve scenes, dialogue, story structure of any kind?",What exactly makes this a book?,"This of course could be fleshed out in the final project, but as of right now, I don't quite see it.",My answer for 3 kind of fits with this too.,"While the execution will be based more on sight and text, seamless pages, and the like, I do think it might miss the mark for a ""future book"" project.",Through the epistolary format--albeit futuristic via email--the book will tell a story about Adam finally getting the nerve to ask for a bartender's number.,"The experience will hopefully be new, engaging, and fun for the reader.","The basic idea for this is really inventive, and I think it'll be fun to see it all pan out.","Using research about email communication can really make this unique, yet extremely relatable.","I feel like the general outline lacks beginning, middle, and end.","The plot will mostly likely flesh itself out as the story is written, but right now I don't see a real ending to the story in the proposal, or any twists and turns.","I think this could easily become very basic, point and click, turn the page sort of narration.","As long as you keep it interesting, the idea of spying on someone's email can keep a reader engaged, but you run the risk of losing the reader through repetition.",This team wants the reader to experience a convergence of time between two stories.,"They want the reader to read two stories of two men who lead very different lives, yet somehow still manage to have the same experiences.",I think that the team has thoroughly thought their sources through; they have a firm grasp on the texts they want to draw upon and they are looking to achieve something akin to the mentioned texts.,"In addition, these sources are dynamic, and touch on a wide array of information.","Social media as a source is also an interesting thought, and can certainly be utilized in the plot.","Also, two simultaneous stories seems to be an interesting way to draw the reader in to the story itself.",I think that the proposal was very well.,"There was a clear outline demonstrating what exactly the group tends to accomplish, as well as a very detailed list of sources that the team intends to draw from.","Additionally, it appears that the group has worked very well together and that they are in clear agreement of the division of work.","The only problem I see is the story not being able to become something; it seems to me that, after having read the outline, I have already read the story itself.","I feel like the two men need to have more of a connection, or an experience that makes them realize that their lives are intertwined.","It would even be interesting if they somehow switched lives (although that would be a little too complex, I think).","Regardless, I just think that, the two stories need to be more connected than simply showing the similarities in the two men and their lives.","Something needs to be significant in this connection, and the men need to realize what that significance is.","Otherwise, there won't seem to be an importance in the story.",The team wants to write a fanfiction of The Raw Shark Texts.,"This fanfiction will use twine to manipulate the events of the story, as well as the character's choices.",The reader will be in control of these happenings.,"I think that, in relation to twine, this is a great idea.","Using a story that many people can relate to and enjoy, and re-creating it so that the reader may decide the fate of the characters, seems very fitting indeed.","It seems as if, were such a program to exist for any book - say, Harry Potter or The Hunger Games, millions of people would flock to the program in order to re-create their favorite stories to be the way they want them.","This being said, I think that allowing the reader to re-create the love story between Eric and Clio is a strength and using twine is definitely the way to do it.",I think this proposal meets the standards set forth by the instructor.,The only other thing I believe there would be to do would be to write the actual story.,There are only so many ways you can explain that you are going to write a fan-fiction without simply writing it.,"I also think that the team explained in great detail their sources and their reasons behind using the sources, as well as explaining the division of work.",I think the hardest part of putting this story together will be embodying the characters of Clio and Eric.,"As a fanfiction, the story will have to stick to the character's personalities in a sense, to stay true to the original story.","In essence, fanfictions are not new, and have existed for a very long time.","Thus, the only thing that will be setting this fan-fiction apart from regular fan-fictions is twine, or the method in which you are executing the story.","Therefore, I think it is necessary to keep this in mind when creating the story, so that you may use events and technologies in your twine story that will help make this fanfiction jump out as being 'futuristic'.",This group is wanting to achieve a futuristic experience for the reader.,"They are hoping for the reader to be a 'detective' almost, stringing together the clues of the multidimensional ""Voices"".",I think the proposal was strong in that it gave a very strong summary of what the goal / intention for the project.,I also think that the group has a very clear understanding of their sources and the ways in which they want to draw from their sources.,"The reasoning behind the sources was very concrete and well-explained, and it seems as if the sources will be a good source of inspiration to the group.","In addition, I would just like to say that I was amused at the description in the division of work section, and I think it is very respectable that two of the group members worked so hard to construct this project.",The only thing that I believe needs to be more constructed is the outline; right now it is rather vague and I am honestly extremely confused it.,"I understand that this is what is supposed to be, but I would finalize things such as ""Some characters; Some stories; speed is choice of writer.""","I understand that you need these things to be vague and that you can't give away the story, but I think that making fragmented phrases into sentences would really help with allowing the reader to understand the general intention of the story.","I think that if the group members figure out all of the details to their plot, the story will come together nicely.","This type of story is perfect for twine and I think that if everything can be pieced together in a way that makes sense, this will be a great example of a futuristic book.",The group appears to trying to emulate modern communication whilst telling a story.,"The strengths lie in that the group already has a very good idea of what they want to write, how they want to write, and what sorts of inspirations they're looking forwards while writing the story.","The idea of using a ""reply"" button in order to continue the story is particularly brilliant.",I honestly do not see any major flaws in this proposal.,The main challenge will probably be managing to be both expository in nature while not making it seem unnatural for the main characters to be communicating in such a fashion.,"However, I do not see many major foreseeable issues with this group.",It aims to use the publishing program in order to both reminiscence about the past while also contemplating the future.,"The story seems very personal, while also well thought in terms of story arc and character.","The proposal is VERY lopsided in terms of labor, as it more or less requires the entire story to be written by a singular person.","It really ought to be more inclusive, or at least have all the members writing about their personal past school experiences rather than just focusing on just one person's.",I have to wonder if this proposal was written with any group consensus in mind.,"Since the workload hasn't been decided on yet, this can become a serious issue if one member is late on their part (be it the writing, editing, learning how to use the Twine program, etc.)",The group appears to be writing several stories that converge and diverge at various points in order to create a unique reading experience.,"It's great the the inspirations for the project step outside of the box, particularly in regards to social media and film.","As the final project is meant to step beyond the book, as it were, using these influences to create something unique is very smart.","Smaller details--such what the men do for their individual jobs, the specific steps they take to part their facade in place--do seem to be missing, especially in regards to any research that might be necessary to complete this project.","However, it is hardly necessary to have all the details ironed out at this part, so it's simply a minor gap in the grand scheme of things.",The biggest for this group will probably be the coding necessary to tell a multi-linear story in the Twine program.,"The group seems to anticipating this with their workload, however, so hopefully it won't be a challenge at all.","The group appears to be interweaving interactivity, sounds, visuals, and literature in order to tell a griping story about the mind.",The strengths of this group are clearly in their organization and planning.,The proposal is very detailed and all the members seem to have a grasp on what is needed from all them to accomplish this goal.,"It's minor, but the DSM V would much more better for research than the DSM IV, due to some significant changes made between editions.","Other than that, there's little to criticize about this project proposal.",The greatest challenge this group has will undoubtedly be research.,"Mental disorders often overlap and are difficult to write about--not everyone with the same mental disorder experiences the symptoms in the same way, for example.",Best of luck to this group nonetheless.,It seems that the idea behind this project proposal is to allow a reader to follow two characters who work in the same office as they experience certain events that occur during one day in their lives.,The reader will have the option to jump back and forth between the characters and then be confronted with a choice as to whether to sympathize with the married man who longs to be single or to sympathize with the single man who longs to be married.,"For the ending, however, it is not clear in the proposal what common thought the two men will have.","This may, in fact, be left up to the reader to decide.","This story is fairly ambitious, but could come off well if the navigational links are effective.",It seems to satisfy the requirement for Š—“a storyŠ— and the references appear to be relevant.,"Overall, the objectives for content (four major sections) have been satisfied.","In the final version, there should be some detail about the actual linking strategy that will be employed in Twine to be able to pull this off.","There seems to be a large number of probable branch (and perhaps conditional) points in the story, so the authors need to be very careful how they develop the links and the story navigation.","If not careful, there is some potential for the reader to be left stranded, with no convenient way to return to his desired point in the story.","Also, the final should include the full citations for the references.","The most significant challenge will be to make all this work as planned in Twine, particularly if there is a plan to include additional multimedia features such as images, audio, or video).",This project will use the hyper-linking features in Twine to create a story in which readers can choose different pathways in learning more about a book that becomes a model for all other books and essentially changes the way books are written.,"This story is very ambitious, but will be very interesting as long as the numerous links that are proposed are designed effectively and if the navigational links are logical.",It seems to satisfy the requirement for Š—“a storyŠ— and the references are relevant to the goals of the project.,"Overall, the objectives for content (four major sections) have been satisfied.","Considering the numbers of links, decision points that seem to be planned for this project, the final version should provide some additional detail about the various branches readers will be able to take.","As in any non-trivial Twine story, the authors should to be very careful how they develop the links and the story navigation so the reader does not get caught at dead ends.","Also, the final should include the full citations for the references.","The most significant challenge will be to make all this work as intended in Twine, particularly if there is a plan to include additional multimedia features such as images, audio, or video).","The intent is of this project is to re-create part of the story in Š—“The Raw Shark TextsŠ— in Twine by allowing the reader to be Clio Aames, a character very important to Eric Sanderson, the primary protagonist in the book.",The linking and other multi-media capabilities in Twine will also be used to enhance the storyŠ—Ès effectiveness.,The eventual planned outcome of the story will either be escape from the Shark (the Ludovician) or permanent entrapment.,This is a very good idea for a story to be developed in Twine.,"It is quite ambitious, but if the storyline can be developed as outlined in this proposal, and if the audio and video enhancements can be successfully implemented, this story should be a very interesting interactive experience for the reader.","The proposal satisfies the requirement for Š—“a story,Š— the objectives for content (four major sections) have been satisfied, and the references mentioned in the Š—“Research and InspirationŠ— section are appropriate (Š—“Jaws,Š— Š—“Frankenstein,Š— and Š—“The Old Man and the SeaŠ—).","In the final version, there should be some detail about the actual linking strategy that will be employed in Twine to be able to pull this off.","There seems to be a large number of probable branch (and perhaps conditional) points in the story, so the authors need to be very careful how they develop the links and the story navigation.","If not careful, there is some potential for the reader to be left stranded, with no convenient way to return to his desired point in the story.","Also, the final should include the full citations for the references.","The most significant challenge will be to make all this work as planned in Twine, particularly if there is a plan to include additional multimedia features such as images, audio, or video).","The idea fueling this proposed story seems to be the creation of a different kind of story Š—– one that introduces both animate and inanimate Š—“voicesŠ— to the reader, and to use the hyperlinking and some of the graphical features of Twine to develop an interactive scenario that allows for branching and exposure to various natural features of our physical environment.","An actual end-point, or resolution for the reader is not evident in the proposal.","In terms of formatting, this proposal meets the stated objective for content (four major sections), and it is a plus that the references have been fully cited, but other aspects have not yet been entirely thought through, at least as indicated so far (see next critique section).",The story as described and outlined so far is nebulous and needs to be fleshed out and explained more in the Final Proposal.,"It is not yet clear what the various Twine links will do for (or to) the reader, and the Š—…voicesŠ—È that are mentioned should be further clarified.","Also, what is the intended end state for the reader?",Will there be critical choices to be made?,Is there some sort of moral to the story at the end?,There should also be some clarification and discussion about the actual linking strategy to be used in Twine and some additional information about the types of images that may be incorporated.,"(BTW, I know that this group was somehow short changed in that there were only two contributing members -- perhaps this may be rectified for the remaining iterations of the project).","Perhaps the most significant challenges will be to work out all of the planned Twine links so they make sense and to make all of this work in Twine without including untended branches to the story and dead-end links, from which the reader has no place to go.",I love the idea of interlinking the story and having clio possibly fail in the attempt to evade and escape the Ludovician.,You have a nice chunk of inspiration and research to go off of.,I like the idea of taking Raw Shark Text and expanding it into an interactive game so to speak utilizing pieces of pop culture along the way.,I think the biggest strength is the interlinking idea.,The group seems to have a good grasp of how to employ Twine in a way that is interesting and difficult but should offer a lot of opportunity for readability and enjoyment for the readers.,I think that the level of inspiration and research the group has is their strongest aspect as they are taking from man sources and are using very specific points.,The group has more of an interactive game than anything else and it seems to be very well planned.,I think the biggest obstacle is the division of labor.,My chief concern is that the beginning of the story and the middle/end might suffer from a large tonal shift or change in written voice if it is skipping writers a lot.,I would be sure to really collaborate a lot so the voice is meshed between everyone and isn't obviously different writers.,I think the biggest challenge for your group and probably for many groups will be piecing it all together inside of Twine.,"Considering the inter-linking and issues of running int Clio not being able to escape and having to restart, etc.",I think that the Twine installation will be your most cumbersome task.,I would focus on completing the story aspect quickly so you can focus on solidifying and bugs that will be in your twine story on,To create the hypothetical story of the future of a fictitious family.,I really like the idea of the various outcomes this families life can play and it really prompts the reader to go back and see how different every family might have been.,I think the biggest strength for this group is the planning it already has set in motion and the various stories that are to be written.,"By collaborating on the general idea but venturing off into ones own stories you completely make the characters unique with their own voices, perceptions and ideas.",Everyone being inspired by different sources and texts and everyone having a totally unique writing style should create a really well rounded story as a whole in the end.,I think one of the biggest concern you need to have is a lack of consistency in character voices throughout the story.,For instance the Wife/Mother story will have the father.,"But if the Husband/Father is a completely different character in the Wife's story than how he is perceived by the reader in the Husband/Father story, then you run into a continuity issue.",The reader if first reading the Husband/Father story and going back to reading the wife/mother will have a differing opinion about her going in.,She will feel dishonest to him as he already previously met her in the father/husband story.,"I would maybe think about once the rough drafts of each story are finished, have each other read over them and see how you can make the characters seem the same throughout.","The biggest issue for your group that I can see is not in the building of the story into Twine, that aspect will be simplistic with few hyperlinks.",I think the biggest issue for your group will be in creating a consistent narrative across the three stories will keeping each one unique.,I like the huge amount of pop culture utilized in your project.,I think this is a fun idea that prompts the reader to go back again and again trying every option to see all the possibilities.,The biggest strength for this group is probably its pre existing knowledge of all the source material.,Obviously you are all fans of Harry Potter and Dr. Who for instance and have a wealth of knowledge of those stories as a result.,"This will help you complete the task of figuring out what questions the narrator might ask and how to answer them to create an honest assessment of what kind of a nerd would like Harry Potter, etc.",I would make sure that the project does not amount to nothing more than a buzzfeed quiz.,"There are a lot of ""What kind of Wine Drinker Are you?""",type quizzes online and this project needs something bigger to set itself apart from that.,I think the most significant challenge for this team concerns their ability to create something that is still mysterious and interesting to the reader.,It will be a really fun and exciting project if completed with the right amount of passion that I think this group is willing to put into it.,What the person who wrote this proposal is aiming to achieve is the creation of a semi-biographical work of fiction.,It will examine the idea of being able to advise younger versions of oneself with the knowledge gained with age.,I think the concept is a good one and could certainly be turned into quite an interesting story.,The progression of the story and its ultimate effect seem to be fairly thoroughly thought through.,The author appears to be quite certain of his goal.,There are still a lot of blanks to be filled in as to how this story will utilize the technology of the program Twine in its storytelling effort.,Perhaps if the reader does not have to experience the different time jumps in a particular order it would make it even more interesting.,Really playing up reader interactivity should be one of the goals.,"Finally, the author may want to rethink writing a section of the story for every single grade of their schooling.",Maybe sticking to the most significant years or experiences over this time period.,It seems as though it would get a bit laborious reading through seventeen panels of significant length for each grade when the character has only advanced a single year.,"If the panels are shorter this might work, but then the author would have a tougher time ensuring the emotional development of the story.",The author seems to have written this proposal entirely on his own with essentially no initial collaboration or discussion with his group.,His idea is also not really structured in such a way that it allows his other group members to participate in it's creation.,"While this would make a good individual project, it does not seem very well thought out for a group format.",The intended outcome of the project is to create a multilinear story that utilizes the technology of Twine to allow a highly interactive experience for the reader.,The plan to incorporate a multitude of options to jump to various points in the story.,"They have a very interesting idea that seams to be inspired, in part, by the premise of the class.",The subject matter is that of the creation of a future book that changes literature forever.,The seems to have a well thought out plot that is reminiscent of the layer story of Abrams & Dorst's S. Their goal to allow a range of interactive freedom to the reader can create a unique experience where a reader could return to the story multiple times and have a different experience by making different choices.,The biggest gaps I can see come merely with the need to iron out the details of the structure.,How and where will the links be positioned to jump to various parts of the story and what will be the logic for such jumps?,"Even if the reader chooses to jump all over the story, some sort of flow must be maintained or the story will appear as nothing more than a random and chopping string of non-sequential events.","Again, the structure needs to be solidified.","The goal can't just be for the ""largest possible number of intersections between narratives"" if those intersections aren't carefully planned and make sense to the reader.",Allowing the reader freedom to guide their own interaction with the story is a great idea.,"However, if enough care isn't given to the sense of where the jumps and intersections are placed, the story could just become a jumbled mess.",There is no proposal attached to this assignment.,"Therefore, I can not critique the proposal for this group.",There is no proposal attached to this assignment.,"Therefore, I can not critique the proposal for this group.",There is no proposal attached to this assignment.,"Therefore, I can not critique the proposal for this group.",There is no proposal attached to this assignment.,"Therefore, I can not critique the proposal for this group.",This team intends to tell a third person linear fiction story.,"At least on that begins as third person, but experiments with other POVs and tenses as it progresses.",The story is an interesting one that employs elements of sci-fi and fantasy.,"It appears as though it will be laid out in the form of a sort of story game, where the reader can actually impact the outcome of the story by their choice.","This structure is similar to the old ""Find-Your-Fate"" books, where the reader was given a choice of various pages to which they could turn in order to make corresponding decisions in the story.",It should be interesting to see how it comes out.,"The interactivity of the story is part of what will draw the reader in, but it must be done in a way that does not derail the story at every turn.","The story must be able to be followed seamlessly, even through these transitions.","Additionally, switching POV and tense is something that shouldn't just be done at random, or it could confuse the reader.","It should be purposeful and warranted, based upon the events of the story.","Experimenting with multiple forms of storytelling can either add or detract from a story, depending upon how it is done.",It seems as though this team is on the right track.,They just need to do several run throughs and a lot of testing to make sure their structure is solid.,Putting out this kind of effort is useless if the end product is too hard for the reader to navigate.,A highly interactive piece like this needs to be constructed very carefully.,"I believe the purpose of this project is to amuse the reader by comparing them to a specific ""book or TV character"" based on their choices as they progress through the narrative.","The team aims to somewhat mimic the format of the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books, allowing readers to interact with the story by making decisions about how they will proceed.",One strength is the way the team has chosen to use Twine's interactive hyperlinks.,"Readers must decide on plot direction, using a ""responsive format"" which I think will give the endeavor a kind of fun-psychological-quiz experience.",The team seems to have polished their list of character options (e.g.,"Bilbo Baggins, Tony Stark, Hook, etc.",); I think these different genres of characters do speak to different personalities in general.,"I'm curious about what the other ""scenes"" will be.","So far I only know of the ""digging a hole"" bit.","The rest of the story could be considered a gap that needs filling, but I'm confident that the team will work on this.",With different choices different lines of narrative may need to be written in order to support the different possibilities.,"If the team is not careful, this fun work could become very labor-intensive.","This team seems to be creating a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" story.","(Twine does seem to encourage these, doesn't it?)","I believe their intention is to offer readers a choice between two alternate ""Raw Shark Text"" endings.","The outline appears comprehensive: a beginning, middle, and ending are provided.",I see that they've included a basic structure for the placement of their hyperlinks.,"It's a good, clean start to the project.","In my opinion, all fanfiction is copyright infringement.",I would encourage the team to create an original story from their collective raw imagination.,"Maybe consider crossing the gap between their new story and those readers who have never heard of ""Raw Shark Texts"".","I believe the team's division of labor will prove challenging for that whole ""too many cooks in one kitchen"" element.",Several people are doing similar lines of writing .,it might work out well or it might get very confusing.,"I think they'll need to make sure their all on the same page (or ""link"", in this case).","To me, the proposal sounds like it has more in common with conceptual art than fiction, so I believe the team is going to give us something very abstract and original.","It definitely strays from the ""idea of what a 'book' is"", as they say.","I think they will achieve something interesting, and this perhaps is their aim.",The team's structure for their work is clear (even if I don't fully understand the details).,The outline is put together well and their summary is easy enough to understand.,"There is a general worldliness to the features that they offer--grass, icebergs, birds, ""everything"".",The trouble with abstracts in fiction is that if they are not portrayed through concrete details they risk becoming incomprehensible.,"As far as improvement, I would say the risk of writing something no one understands ought to be factored into the team's decisions and their narrative.",The greatest challenge might be in trying to be too universal.,"Can they write about ""everything""?","Similarly, can they reasonably expect their readers to keep adding to their story (""once the common thread is figured out"")?","I would say the goal of this project is to illustrate the old cliche, ""The grass is always greener on the other side.""",I think the plot is very clever and well designed.,There is a cohesiveness to the narrative and a definite purpose to its course.,"More, I think the parallel lives of the two main characters and the thought(s) they'll share at the ending of both stories is well-planned.","The only gaps I see are the stories' details, but these will be filled in as each author does their writing.",Having two different authors writing two different narratives that must coordinate at different points might prove difficult.,At least they're aiming for the same target--the ending--and that might make things easier.,"This team is aiming to portray the lives of three people (father, mother, and daughter) as affected by the decision of whether or not to have a child.",Twine will be used to present the lives of each character as seen from their perspective.,I really like this idea!,"I think using Twine to ""flesh out"" the lives of each character is ingenious.","Because you can't undo your choice on Twine without finishing out the story, it gives us the illusion that once we make a choice, we can't change it (although on a minor scale compared to real-life decisions).",The research/inspiration section is excellent; there are so many different sources being used to add to this story.,I really think this is a strong proposal.,"I don't see any gaps, I just wonder if the interactive format will continue after the reader decides which perspective to choose, or if it will end with that and lead into three traditional short stories.",The one thing I think is important to consider is what happens after your reader makes their decision.,"Will each choice lead them to another series of choices (aside from he secondary choice between POV if they initially pick ""Yes""), or will it lead to separate traditional short pieces of fiction?","I only ask because I think the more interaction there is with the reader, the better, at least in terms of a futuristic interactive book.",This team is creating a story-line with an outcome that will be almost entirely established by the reader.,The reader will go through a series of choices that will determine which fictional character they are.,"I think this proposal plays on a lot of well-known and well-loved characters, which will make it relevant to a lot of its readers.","It sounds like whatever the story line is will be fun and interesting, judging by the final outcome lineups!",The research section is great in explaining how and why you chose the format you chose.,I honestly don't see any gaps.,"Obviously the story will have to be fleshed out a bit in terms of the details - what decisions will the reader be making, what will the actual turns be in the story, etc.",but those are all details to be worked out as it gets written.,There are a lot of possible outcomes - that means a lot of different possible combinations will have to be made into different pages.,"I'm no expert in Twine, so that could be perfectly plausible, I just know on a lot of the Twines I was watching for examples there weren't quite as many possible outcomes.",Just something to consider when actually putting the plan into action!,"This team is aiming to create an original story about a psychoanalyst, with the majority of the plot actually determined by the reader.","I love, LOVE the premise of this story.",It's such an interesting idea in terms of psychology.,"I think psychological disorders are hugely interesting, and adding the twist just makes it even better.","The fact that it's interactive adds to its effect, because it will involve the readers in the fate of the character, giving them the power to bend her psychological well-being.","I really love every part of this, except for the Halloween aspect.",I think the constant dark rain clouds and the dark nature of the story itself will create the mood that the writers are looking for.,"The Halloween setting might be overkill, unless it's somehow adding to the story's plot in a fundamental way.",I love the idea of switching back and forth between 2nd and 3rd person.,"My only question would be, what is the ""cue"" to the reader that they are about to switch tenses?","It is a good idea to have the reader somewhat disoriented to really engage them in the story, but it has to be done really purposefully, otherwise it just creates confusion.","Will the 2nd person be in italics, for example, or will there be some other ""hint"" that it's in 2nd person for a reason, and not just as a slip of tense?",This team is aiming to portray a story between two friends and one's crush.,The story will use interactive formatting to draw readers in and make them feel as if they are a part of the conversation between the friends.,"I think this is such a great idea, and it uses things that are relevant to its readers to further engage them in the story.",Using an e-mail format with the reply feature as a link is really clever.,"The slice of life aspect of the story makes for a great interactive piece, since it doesn't necessarily have to be resolved or include anything too ""deep.""","I think considering that this is supposed to be a straightforward ""slice of life"" piece, it's really all covered in the proposal.",I don't see any gaps that need to be filled.,"I might just suggest making sure the characters are somehow developed in a way that readers will really be invested in them at least somewhat, which can be difficult in e-mail format.",It can definitely be done though - there is a book series I read when I was younger where the plot is made up entirely of texts and e-mails sent between three friends.,"I think the only thing that needs to be considered is how the action of the story is going to be moved forward through the e-mails without it being ""obvious"" - how are we going to get a good description of Trevor and still make it seem like a genuine conversation between two friends?","I'm sure it can be done and done well, it's just something to consider when writing the dialogue itself.","This project is going to give an array of voices to things which we normally don't think of as having a voice, exploring our reality in a unique way by looking at the objects around us from what sounds like a bit of a surrealist perspective.","Despite the varying objects and voices involved, the team wants the reader to be aware of the unifying voice of awareness of the story, which sounds to me maybe a bit like consciousness itself, or maybe the stream of connection from The Raw Shark Texts.","I think the second half of the proposal, of its unifying theme, is powerful and important.","This is a very 'future book'-esque concept, bringing awareness to the awareness it takes to read or interpret all of these different objects.","I'm also blown away by the great array of your influences, wow!","There are really some great works in there, and I see a direct correlation to The Illustrated Man, and I think Poe is such a pivotal and important influence on everything.","You have such a strong foundation, going off of those examples of incredible writing and concepts.","Obviously, as this is an outline only, I think the writing of the actual objects needs to be strong so this doesn't end up sounding a bit like a children's book.","Just because of the outline format, the rocks and other inanimate objects having brief voices does sound a bit surreal in a young way.","However, I totally realize that this is brief with intention and design, because this project is just for a proposal and not the actual work itself.","Your influences sound like this will be nothing like a children's book, so I think that will sort itself out as you work.","The main challenge I see here is this is a great project idea, but it sounds very labor intensive, especially making all the different voices speak in Twine in different boards.","I write a blog and I am sometimes blown away by the amount of time I've spent with just formatting and coding a single page of text, and then proofreading it.",You guys definitely have your work cut out for you!,"I have a similar situation in my group, as one member isn't participating as of yet.","Hopefully if you can get all three members on board and chugging out text and inputting into Twine in a sort of pre-arranged format, you'll be able to create what you want.","My advice for this challenge would be to focus on one object, maybe, and perfect that, and gauge how long that takes before deciding how many more objects you'll be able to complete for the entire story.","This class is so accelerated, I really think time is of the essence for all of us.","But I love this idea, and this seems like a very solid project!","This team is aiming to create a chilling suspense story, and present a gripping twist at the end.",Sounds like a book I'd pick up (or click to online)...,"This is an incredibly thought out proposal, specifically the story itself.","I think the concept itself is the strength, as the plot is a very inventive story.","The plot will keep the reader moving through the book, as there is suspense there.","This plot also relates to a big theme in our society today, not only through the influences that this group mentioned, but also in mystery fiction as detectives merge with the evil that they hunt, police become brutal like the bad guys that they kill, etc.","The theme here is relevant and with a twist, promises to be quite interesting.","Pivoting off of the proposal's strength, I think the storyline itself is going to be a bit difficult to build up to a quality level in a few weeks time.","I certainly have faith in the group to do it, but there is so much that needs to be filled out as this could be a lengthy novel or television show, that it will be quite a crunch.","I wonder if the concept of monsters and the concept of mental illness may be too much to present at one time, and it may be easier to simply present other people's mental illness/memories and get away from the suggestion of anything supernatural.","I think it would be awesome to incorporate the metaphor of monsters in there, if you are able, but I think it may become very complicated.","As my last response stated, I see the main problem here developing such a complicated plot in a quick time.","I'm not sure that as a reader, I would find music that helpful unless it is presented in a rhythmic way like we saw with the YH Chang videos, as I think music when reading a novel or longer work is pretty distracting.","That is just my opinion, however--I tend to be a pretty traditional reader.",I think the challenge here will be making such a complicated plot come across clearly in such a short time period.,"My suggestion to complete this challenge would be focusing more on the story, as it is so strong, and less on the photos and music.","I realize that this is not a very future of the book-ish suggestion, however.","As with the first group I peer reviewed, I'm really excited for your project as it sounds very cool.","This team is aiming to illustrate the effects our choices have on us through three different narratives, from three different perspectives, of different outcomes of a pivotal argument in a couple's life--should they have child or not?","By exploring this question from several angles using different storytelling methods (point-of-view, perspective, and the technology available on Twine) this team will illustrate how our choices change our futures.","The strength here, it seems to me, is the clear divide of the storyline between the three of you.",This seems like a great way to do a group project.,I also like how two of the story arcs are drawing from such personal and unique experiences--I think each author's perspective will bring a lot to the story here.,"I was actually thinking of Adam Johnson's ""Trauma Plate"" as the story was being described before Jeremy mentioned it in his section, so I think your influences and idea are very clear and well thought out.","As with any story where the narrative shifts, I think the hardest thing to do hear will be to maintain a unifying connection throughout the work.",I think this will also be made more difficult because each piece is being written individually.,"You mentioned Cloud Atlas as an influence, and I think bringing all the stories together in some way, even if they are wildly different, whether it be through a theme or just an echo of experience, would really pull this piece together.","I think this team has done a great job of dividing their creation workload very clearly, which will really help them achieve their goals quickly.","Sort of going off of what I said above, I think coordinating the same sort of user experience between each person's narrative on Twine, as three individuals are uploading their work individually, might slow things down, but this might be unnecessary as the stories are entirely different.","This team will create an interactive narrative in which the final scenes reveal something about the reader themselves, through the options they have chosen.","The aspect that is most polished seems to be the research relating to the interactive narrative, and the concept of the interactive narrative itself.","Although this sounds quite complicated to pull off, I think the Twine format in general seems to be built exactly for this style of Choose Your Own Adventure Game and so I think this type of story will really blossom in Twine, as you'll be able to incorporate so many features you wouldn't in a hardcover book.",Definitely very future book-esque.,"The gap I noticed, a bit of a pun here, is the story of the mysterious characters filling the hole.","As this is just an outline, obviously I didn't expect the whole story here but it will be interesting to see how this is executed, with the many different options and the mystery involved.","I think that games in general tend to lose the literary aspect of reading and books, and I think that the story itself, of the men and the hole, needs to not be forgotten amongst the many neat formatting options available on Twine.","There isn't much action presented here, just the mystery surrounding their identity, so I'm not sure if this is due to the outline format or it needs to be built up more.","I think this team will has chosen the most complicated Twine layout, with many multiple options and their quiz structure, out of all the projects I've reviewed.","This is great, of course, but I think this means this could be a bit of a daunting project to keep straight and format online.","As time is of the essence here, I think keeping all the multiple options and layers straight for the multiple choices will be the greatest challenge.","However, I have confidence that Twine was created for just this type of challenge, and this team will rock it.",I'm excited to see the final project.,"From what I read, the team is aiming to achieve Clio Aames perspective.",In the end it all determines if Clio the reader made the right decisions.,I can see the proposal strengths are telling what story they will use which was Raw Shark Text.,They explain the novel will be told in through twines link feature and it will be a multilinear fan-fiction.,Explain more on how the sites will shape the narrative.,"Probably the most difficult challenge this team will face will providing more detail of the story being told in Clio view points,","I like the idea of the project, after reading the proposal I see the team is aiming towards compare and contrast paper between the two men.",I think the strengths in the proposal are converting the men in the end to desiring each other lives in the end which shows the multilinear function of the story.,I would say comparing each of the men's lives and showing the desire for each other lives shows that the men are not appreciating what they have.,"I think this proposal needs some improvement in explain in more detail the differences in the men's lives, I think it needs more information as to why the lives of each men's are appealing to each other, I think it loses the readers attention when the two men are just being compared to one another.",Also I don't see where the barista life is relevant to the lives of the two men.,You don't explain in the end what the barista is thinking.,I think the team will experience a significance challenge in merging the life of a Barista to be compared.,I think this will be the most significance challenge in achieving their goal of multilinear work of fiction.,I think the outcome of this final project will be to use the twine feature of an email link to get to the next portion of the story.,The team is aiming to achieve that the reader is able to get through the story through the email link.,I think the proposal strength in relation to the assignment is being able to accomplish an understanding of the story through the twine feature.,I think that the emails being sent in a linear timeline are the most polished and thought through.,I think that the proposal needs improvement in the characters explaining more about them will give the reader a better understanding.,I think the team will face the most significant challenge when using the twine feature of the email link.,"This project will approach an epistolary story in a modern setting, using technology to more accurately represent the back-and-forth of email exchanges.",The primary strength of this proposal is that it is clean and achievable.,"The use of Twine is well thought-out, and the events of the story itself is nearly complete.","Moving forward, they should have very few major hurdles to completion.",The proposal itself is sound.,The only improvements would be in finding better ways to utilize Twine beyond simply adding .gifs.,I would also like to see some theme within the story itself that is related to the course.,"What makes THIS story part of our class, beyond the way it is being written?",
