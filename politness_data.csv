Sentence,Label
I think if you expanded on what you wanted your music playing device would do or even look/ sound like it would have stretched your thinking a bit more.
If I was your partner Id suggest adding visuals to make it more of an installation.
I am not much of a sound girl so I would like to come up with some visuals to add to your abstract music piece.
"Do the different sounds have to by programmed to keys or can we think of a more interesting way to ""play""."
Or are the sounds you play the important part of your project?
Is it strictly abstract or can there be a way for the user to express themselves having more control??
"All three of the questions were answered, but, in my opinion, were a little vague."
"The answers stated pretty much what they wanted to do, but I didn't read very much thought being put into these answers."
"All questions are answered clearly, just not in a very detailed manner."
"Using the ideas laid out with creating music using RGB values, I think we could make something that also looks at everyday objects and people to create music in an experimental manner."
"On the first and third questions they had a pretty solid idea, but question two they failed to put really any effort or real thought into."
The first idea could be fleshed out better in terms of how the physical presentation would look like as well as why their idea is important and what the goal of it is.
A very simple midi keyboard program for a computer.
Another ipod?
A program that reads color and turns it into music.
"A program that uses the keyboard controller they proposed in the first idea, but instead of just playing & recording music, the keys would also play colors that the creator would match up to certain notes or sounds according to their perception of emotion."
"In all of the projects, he or she discusses the use of lasers."
"Though the projects are very similar in their use of lasers, they are also fairly different ideas."
The student made a good effort to expand upon their ideas and give details.
"They want one project using lasers as a form of data transfer, laser interactive project and another basic max/patch laser project."
Using a laser to initiate sounds while playing a game.
Passing data via laser doesn’t seem plausible to me.
"There are definitely three separate ideas proposed, but all based around similar technology: lasers."
"All seem like pretty solid ideas; one being to make a simple environment where laser are pointed at targets to create musical tones, another using laser signals to beam data between devices, and the last using lasers for a target practice type game."
The first and third ideas seem most plausible.
"Combining the two, we could make certain noises when different targets are hit."
"Expanding on just the third idea, we could make a few different environments for the target simulator."
"Maybe something as simple as the silhouette targets police use in a shooting range, or as complex as a city street/alley/etc."
I feel the student elaborated enough to get o good idea of what they are aiming for.
The first idea is to create some kind of musical instrument incorporating lasers.
The second idea is to use lasers to send information to different devices they also stated that some of the technology may need to be further developed.
The last idea is some sort of shooting game with lasers and a projector.
I think that the video game idea using lasers is possible to accomplish this semester.
But maybe using a wii remote would work better than using the kinect since there may not be too much motion.
The first one the student wants to make is a music system which controlled by some unique instruments.
The second one is to build anthropopathic robot soldiers.
The third one is to build a virtual reality glove.
The glove project is the most interesting project.
"It is hard to track person's hand moving, I know."
But you can develop the idea further.
"For example, if you can use the glove to remote manipulate some objects."
"Or even an idea, but I think the introduction video will be awesome."
"Overall, I believe this person put a decent amount of thought into the ideas."
Each idea is written vividly and thoroughly.
The first idea is basically to create a device that generates midi sounds with an arduino and some buttons/knobs.
"The second idea is basically creating remote control soldiers for the use of the army, essentially making military deaths a thing of the past."
The third idea is to create a glove that works with the oculus rift to track hand movements to be translated into the virtual world within the oculus rift.
"If I were to collaborate with this student, I would try and find a good blend between using the oculus rift and glove ideas, with the robot army idea."
"They both are necessary for eachother, so I think that makes complete sense."
"These projects - a simple midi controller, soldier drones, and a video game glove - have all been proposed many times."
"We see these types of things all the time in movies, and occasionally in real life."
"It doesn't seem like the thinking was stretched very much, but that previous ideas were re-used."
"Honestly, anything I can think of has already been done."
"My initial thought was to combine 1 & 3, to make a glove that works like a midi controller."
"However, that was basically done recently by Imogen Heap."
Another idea would be to combine the soldier drone suit and the game controller.
"Just having a full-body controller for VR systems, but that would take more than a semester."
"This student made a sincere effort in proposing the ideas, as each one feels thought out to the extent that they can be in such a short amount of time."
"The first idea was to make a midi controller, which seems to require hardware that is simple to make and some programming that this student is not confident in doing."
"The second idea was to make unmanned robots that function similarly to human beings, allowing soldiers to control one as if it was their own body without the risk of death."
"The third idea was a glove for virtual reality that can mimic the actions of the player, allowing the player to interact with the virtual world similarly to the real world, potentially with haptic feedback."
"The virtual reality glove would require a lot of fine-tuning in order to make it complete, and although I don't have much experience with working on hardware, I would be able to work on the software end of the project."
"Rather than trying to replicate the exact feelings of the player moving their hand, I would shift towards a more game-oriented end goal by programming the glove to sense the user's reason for using their hand then acting accordingly (for example, a grasping hand motion would be registered as the user trying to grab something, which would then cause the user's avatar in the virtual world to grab something)."
"This is more game-focused than the original idea, though it would be the same project overall."
The answers displayed here show that a lot of thought was put into these questions.
"Everything was answered clearly and concisely, with lots of detail and creativity."
I'd love to work with the arduino live music control.
"One thing we could add would be programable visuals with the live music, in order to enhance the live experience."
"This could be with projection mapping, color recognition, or even animations."
They definitely made a sincere effort in writing this assignment.
They do propose three things.
The first being idea being to create a video or a website.
The second idea was to create an app that would keep people informed of basically what is going on in the world and how they could help.
The third being an app that allowed people attending a concert to be able to listen to it through their personal device which would also allow them to adjust the EQ settings of the audio.
I like the idea of having an app that allows you to interact with a concert you are attending.
I also like the idea of having sort of one central app that allows you to research and donate to causes around the world.
I think that would be the best bet.
"The ideas feel somewhat proposed as they are, though I'm left with many questions as to how something would be made or how complicated it would be."
The first idea talks about skills more than what can be accomplished.
"It seems that this student is not entirely aware of what they can do with their skillset, specifically due to lack of programming knowledge."
The second idea is understandable yet I'm not sure as to how this would take a large amount of money and time.
"It feels like setting up an incredibly large and intricate information system, then giving that information to the user in a simplified format."
The third idea is clear though the student does not write about how something like that is feasible; I feel that it's less of a technical project on the student's end and would mostly require interacting with and convincing the performers and producers at the concert to let them hook up things for the app to work.
"I'd shift this student's third idea away from live concerts and more towards an app that could simulate what an actual concert might be like given some music, wherever they may be."
"It would consist of the same features and would focus more on the app's software than interacting with music that is currently playing, allowing users to play a song and change various settings to make it sound as if it was being played live."
I would feel that it would be more feasible and more about the technical efforts than interacting with musicians themselves.
"I would say that ideas 2 and 3 are definitely more focused with and objective, however though I am impressed with idea 1, it explains more of what your skills are rather than an actual particular project such as ""make a video that does X"" or ""compose a song around X ideas""."
"I got confused at the beginning of 1 because you state that you could build a website but then later make note that you do not have much programming experience, so I am assuming this would be done by some other means like a template website designer and not actually using HTML and CSS."
"Seeing as how this student is very arts based with design, video, and music, I feel we could work well together as I do myself have many artistic qualities (I am also a musician) but I also have some programming experience to work on the more technical level."
"I think it would be possible to work on some iteration, if not the complete idea, of the third proposed project."
We could probably achieve a basic prototype form through the use of Max MSP I would assume.
We could blend their experience of live sound and my capacity to finagle Max.
Overall I felt that the student made a good effort to explain their ideas.
An unspecified rough app or computer program.
A series of sensors in bikes and/ or cars that alert drivers/ cyclists to potential collisions.
An app that the city/ police can use to see where cyclist have had accidents or poor experiences so that changes can be made to prevent future accidents.
"Rolling with this idea, the student and I could make an app that would allow people to rate and share experiences of certain routes or part of a city for use by cyclists."
"Users would record their experiences, along with a positive or negative rating, and link them to a certain area on a map of the city."
"Overall ratings for different areas would show up over time, giving both locals and visitors a map of safe biking routes and notable places to avoid."
This student is looking to create a prototype of an interface that is beneficial to those who like to ride their bicycles on the road and care about their safety.
"I think they did clearly propose their motivations and thoughts, being concerned with improving public cycling collisions and allowing some sort of warning system."
"I am a cyclist myself and have designed my own apps on photoshop, so this actually is interesting to me."
Maybe in the app include some of the traffic going on in areas and color coding the safety with the roads.
I believe that some solid effort was put into this by the student.
The ideas were well thought out and put lots of variables into consideration with cycling.
Cycling is a largely used mode of transportation so these ideas will most likely be successful.
I like the idea of simplifying things like routes and safety in cycling.
"I think we could think up ways on how we could branch out with these ideas or even conjure up some more,"
"You have a great goal, to make cycling safer."
If only you wrote down a few more ways to achieve this.
A way to report dangers threw an app or something is a great idea.
It would give cyclist a voice and push the city to make changes.
What other ways can this be done?
If I was your partner I think Id like to focus on researching the ways large cities are doing this.
Id like to propose a way to physically make cycling safer threw lights that interact with cars and the roadways.
If we could come up with a way to make communication easier for a cyclist while they ride I think that would achieve some part of your goal.
If we could update a rider of upcoming dangers as they ride that would be helpful.
This student definitely went in depth and was really detailed about what they would do in these situations.
"I honestly believe they could get a lot done in a week from the first question, do something really awesome and a lot of good from the second question, and continue their project on and make it better in the third answer."
"I could definitely collaborate in making a video or board game with them, creating sketches or doing animation, and I think that would be a lot of fun, especially if it is combined with the other two ideas, into an interactive game, maybe for physical therapy or something."
"I wouldn't be able to do much with the VR part, but I could definitely help with design."
"The first, week-long project would simply be an outline for a longer-term project."
The second idea is to develop some form of cerebral interface for virtual reality games.
The third idea is to create an AI that learns from it's mistakes.
I could help to develop the visual representations for this world the AI will explore or meld with.
But that's about all I'd have to offer to this project.
"1) A quick board/video game
2) NCVR - Virtual Reality that is truly immersive (utilizing all senses)
3) Creating an AI

It seems like they really put some thought into it, as it all seems to build upon each other."
"However, the semester idea seems perhaps too ambitious."
"It might be interesting to do sort of an augmented reality space - a physical landscape used in a ""game"" in which a user completes tasks/challenges with the aid of things like visual displays (a la Google Glass) and actuator gloves."
He/she has ideas about the game design are related human body and nervous system.
His/her plans and ideas are related each other.
"Also, he/she has rough design concept and I think he/she has potential energy to develop and realize the system."
"That is not perfect yet, but it would be great project under his/her plans during this collaboration project."
"Also, his/her NCVR project is not far away from today."
I can imagine his/her project would be foundation stone for future project about the NCVR and AI.
"If he/she meet and collaborate with designers such as a visual, sound, and media installation person, this project would be great interactive gaming system."
This project is quite impressive for me.
"I can tell that this student is very passionate about virtual reality, as am I."
This NCVR sounds like an excellent idea (albeit a little risky) but it would definitely be the next step in VR.
"Visuals have been covered by systems such as the Oculus Rift, but that's as far as it goes (to my knowledge)."
"By the look of it, I think we could make a really good VR game together."
"The ideas and goals are all there, we would just need to work for a long time to reach those goals."
Game are a huge part of my life so I could think of lots of ideas on how this project could take off.
Yes they made a effort with their three ideas being.
To build a moto-Bike of some sort similar to a moped.
To create a water powered system to create energy.
To make an interactive environment  with lasers and such.
I thing a projection based art project would be cool we could make some sort of projection mapping setup that allowed the laser graffiti to be made on a number of different objects.
I think they thought about what they wanted to do.
It was what seemed to be as much elaboration as needed for this type of assignment.
It seemed like everything was more or less just an idea and there was nothing that had really been thought of.
This student mentioned wanting to do some kind of game and I wanted to do games and incorporate fitness and gaming.
So with an arcade game we could find a way to make something that got the body moving.
He also wanted to do something with generating power but with water.
Well we could make a game that generated power based on body movement.
That would be really fun.
Put a motor on the bike.
Find some thing can save water or other resources.
Using laser technology into projection mapping.
I am very interesting in the third idea.
I am also like projecting mapping and interactive project.
"Base on your idea, I would like to do some ""gun"" game."
"The gun could have the laser in it, so when you ""shoot"" the wall, the wall will has a ""real"" black hole."
"On the projection mapping wall, we can create some visual effects that has strong connection with the gun."
I love the idea of cars running on water.
The change to the environment it would make would be spectacular.
"Also, the laser gun and light graffiti both sound really fun and artistic."
"We could probably make (with a bit of programming knowledge) an awesome game where, as it has been said, draw lines with lasers on a giant projected light wall."
The fundamentals seem pretty basic for something that could turn out to be really cool.
They actually seem to emit a sense of having a clear idea on their heads that may just be much easier to describe with pictures rather than words.
"i can see their vision, but not much of the whole concept yet."
"Okay:

I picture this proposition of creating some sort of ""photon graffiti"" that would SOMEHOW work by vandalizing anything you want in an extremely removable way."
Maybe something that could last for a few hours only or who knows.
"Maybe I am thinking way too outside the box, let's try again:

A projector that is kept on for scribbling anything on your wall for reminders and what not, using ""light pens"", and not worry about having a corkboard or whiteboard for everything you wanna plan."
Go caveman on it and scribble freely in the room without making an actual mess.
"These sci-fi movies sometimes have these fancy holograms to make a visual explanation of their plans and we could develop something similar, except much more versatile and less impossible like holograms that pop out of thin air."
"Although they made attempts and I think their ideas were in the right direction because the person wanted to tackle larger problems; however, they didn't propose workable ideas."
I would take idea number 2 because at least we both would be interested in some kind of reform in education funding.
We could work on an artpiece that would show how our government allocates money.
"Since we would be tackling politics, having the funds of billions of dollars would allow us to say whatever is necessary, regardless of what corporations/people are offended."
"I mean, they didn't really propose anything for the first idea."
"Technically, they answered the actual question to the fullest, because it asked ""what could you yourself accomplish in a week?"""
"They said that with one week to do something, they could get the planning phase done, and start to draw up concepts to actually get a finished product."
There was no idea stated.
"For the second, they gave more of an idea of creating a way to make higher education accessible to all those who wish to further their learning, but beyond that there was nothing."
"The same goes for the third idea, there was not a specific idea to state, but rather that it would be better to work in a group to get stuff done."
"Literally, it's almost impossible to get something done with this students ideas, because there is nothing to go off of."
The only thing to go off of would be that we would be coming together for one cause.
I do not believe that this student took much time and getting this homework assignment or really tried.
"There isn't much to be able to think about here, and although buying convertibles for everyone sounds like a good idea, it doesn't have anything to do with our major or creating something from nothing."
There is nothing I can collaborate with another student on because they didn't write enough idea down for something to be created in a partnership.
"Idea 1: It is not really a full idea, but rather a general 'first steps to a larger project'  outline."
"Idea 2: The idea is to assemble a team that can work to find a way to make a college education free for everyone, or to buy everyone a sports car should this team prove unsuccessful."
"Idea3: This is not really a full idea either, but it builds on the idea of assembling a team presented in Idea 2."
"While the specifics of the process this student would like use when starting to work on something are fleshed-out a bit, the specifics of what this student would like to do are only expressed in the Second idea concerning free college education."
So it is a little vague.
"My ideas involved animation, and this students ideas involved collaboration/team-building and taking on a major issue (College costs)."
"So a joint project might take the form of an exploration of some major problem or concern, and an animation that enhances some aspect of our efforts or our reporting."
"It might be used to explain the problem, to explain a proposed solution, to explore the issue further, or report on the successes or failures of our efforts."
"In many things, including animation, a team usually make it easier."
"Ideas 1 and 3 do not have a definitive project idea and are more so how far along one could develop the stages of making an idea in that time, whereas 2 the idea is to find a way to make education free to individuals."
"In idea one the student states that they could outline and blueprint some rough ideas of what a final project may do, and plan the next stages to get there."
In idea 3 the student states that they would recruit a team of individuals to develop a more cohesive project.
I feel personally that I could help with the first idea of planning things and putting them into motion.
One thing I could do would be possibly build some rough prototypical components of some ideas they have to gauge how it might function in a real life application.
"I believe that the student made a sincere effort into their answers for ideas 1 and 2, and to a lesser extent idea 3."
"Idea 2 could have used some more clarification as I am not wholly sure what these group games are, while idea three could use some expanding upon."
"Their one week idea was to create a mini-game that tested the end users reaction time and post their ""score"" on an internet serve, thus allowing players to rank their times.If they were given no time or money limit they would want to construct a world fitness center that both explores the concept of group games that promote healthy fitness as well as having machines/other equipment that help the users stay fit."
They are willing to offer prize incentives for working overtime.
For their semester goal they wish they wish to be more involved in their gaming company and create several more games for a college student audience that help them with their class studies.
"For your semester project goal, I think you might be onto something."
"Many freshmen come into college shocked at how different it is in comparison to high school, and thus, take a while to get settled down into their new world."
"Maybe you could construct a game that helps freshmen college student ""learn the ropes"" if it were to how to survive your college experience."
"Maybe tailor made to ASU instead of a general  college survival guide, you could make games that illustrate how to use Blackboard or Ctitviz, maybe include a 3D map of the school in a racing game that subconsciously teaches you how to get around the school campus."
This student did a great job at stretching their thinking.
"There are three ideas present, each with their own unique twist on them due to the limitations of either time or money."
"The first idea is a game, not sure what platform, that calculates reaction time of the user."
"It would be awesome to have further discussion on what this could be used for; personally, I see this mini-game being used for competition entertainment between friends."
The second idea is a group of games used to encourage a healthy and fit lifestyle by using a reward benefactor to motivate people.
The third idea touches briefly on the student's passion to expand their gaming company.
"In the past I have worked on classical compositions, musicals, and even post production for short films."
"In this case, I would love to use my skills in sound design, musical composition, and as a musician to integrate sound and audio into the experience of games."
I would love to find a way to use sound in a way that it has never been used for in games to create a dynamic interactive experience in games.
"On a much more simple note, I would also like to create the theme music for this person's games."
As far as the description of the idea goes it does hit some points.
I like the idea of the game for fitness.
I'm a little confused about it being an video games or an physical game like sports?
I like how it would incorporate on the physical aspect of fitness like using gym equipments for the workout.
The incentive on accumulating points is also a great idea.
I picture this idea as in the Wii Fit game but not augmented reality?
An example on this would be helpful for a visual example.
I would like to work on this project because my idea is about fitness as well.
If we can incorporate on kind of campaign about well-fitness and create an event or program that utilize this game I believe this project will be incredible project to work on.
If people see there are incentives on exercising and also being fit because the ultimate goal is about fitness and seeing that it is fun to work out they would participate on the event/game.
"Idea 1: a simple game that measures reaction time to different situations, and shows these times against the times of others."
"Idea 2: A collection of games that promote exercise and fitness, some of which incorporate gym equipment, all of which are part of a larger businesslike organization."
Idea 3: Expanding an already established gaming company that focuses on college course material.
This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them.
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve gaming (specifically concerning fitness and foundation building for classes)."
So a joint project would probably take the form of a video game.
"I have done 3D art for video games, and any game that incorporated character animation (as so many do) would align with my main interest in animation."
The ideas here are fairly well-thought-out.
"None of these ideas are very detailed, but at this point, they have enough information that can see the thought put into the ideas."
I like the idea for the graphic design that would get the world excited about helping make earth a better place to be.
"I have a similar idea that I think could go along this, adding social media capabilities, and getting as many people involved as possible."
"The first and third ideas - using hand-painted images for a wedding, etc."
"book, and educational games - have been done many times over."
"The second idea - changing the look of a building based on internal or external activity - seems like it could be done easily enough, and I don't know that it's been done before."
I think I would want to scale down the second idea.
"Instead of changing the outside of a building, we could make a projection that alters image based on interaction of viewers in front of a sensor such as a kinect."
There is a coherent project idea in each answer.
A set of hand painted images than could be formatted into booklets for special occasions.
An interactive building facade on a skyscraper that changed base don the people in it or by it that highlighted them in some way.
A business that creates games that are both educational and entertaining.
Working on a small game or proof of concept that taught geologic principles through exploration of underground tunnels and caves would be a potential idea.
"The idea for this is to have students discover different types of rock and geological processes while actually down in the depths of the earth, showing why this information si interesting firsthand."
"I think the student has interesting ideas regarding the exploratory questions of this assignment, but needs to be more specific about their ideas in question 2 and 3."
"How would the display make the skyscraper building ""less standard""?"
What are the games that can be played outside of the classroom?
"His/her three ideas are to create a wedding book of painted stock images, an interactive display of digital arts at the side of a skyscraper, and an educational video games based on a business idea."
The three ideas can be combined into one.
I am thinking of displaying the wedding book's pictures at the side of the Skyscraper where people passing by can interact with the pictures with their hand movements as though they are playing video games.
"The first idea was a scanable storybook program, that simplifies and makes creating photo albums easy and simple."
"The second was to create a building that would react to people in, around, and people looking at the building, interacting visually with all of them."
"The third idea is video game education program, working inside schools and possibly outside."
"The ideas were sincere but the last idea really could have been explained a bit more, all ideas are good."
"Especially the building idea, it really makes me wish that existed in a large scale."
"Well working within the education game, you could possible extend the controller of the program into physical space."
Using arduino to create physical controllers would be simple and could create a new realm for the game to be played in.
"There are three good ideas present, however not all answers have deeply thought out ideas."
I love the ideas but I wish the student would have expanded on their ideas.
The first idea is to create a first person shooter game.
I like the idea of creating a map/level that can be added to a first person shooter game.
"It would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content."
The second idea is to build a gaming team to create video games that raise discussion on important topics/issues in the world.
These games will also keep the traditional aspect of what a game is.
The third idea would be to create an exploration game.
"As I said before, it would be awesome to have a game that allowed the game community and its aspiring developers be the creation factor of the maps, levels, and content."
I would love to collaborate and work as the creative/business side of the video game design process.
It would be great to work as a team to deliver content to existing games or even new games that promote community driven creation within games.
"This would give power to the game community, almost like an ultimate sandbox."
"Idea one is to design a game, non-functional, but with the architecture in place."
Idea two is to essentially make their own video game development company and eventually build the best game possible.
"Lastly, idea 3 is to make a small exploration driven game, examples are stated but I have no experience with any of them to know what they may be."
"I do not have any experience with game design whatsoever, and very limited experience with building 3D models only in Rhino for prototypes, I do not believe that could be taken into Unity or anything like that as far as I know."
"What I can do however is lots of audio based things so I feel I could definitely help this person in making a game by being a sound engineer, capture foley-esque sound effects to implement in the game, and I could even write some accompanying music."
"I think this could make for a great experience, having a visual expert and audio expert on the same team, I do not know how to program these songs in any game engine however, I could only make them."
You know what you want to do so the stretching your thinking can be done in the context of your video game.
"since we are talking about making the world a better place does the game teach the user, inform them, anything other then just entertaining them?"
i could help with what goes on in the game.
The story line or goal in the game.
A first person shooter game.
He would like to do many games to gain experiences.
Then he will use his experience to do a big game which has important topics to the society.
3.A small exploration driving game.
"As the author mentions, he is a game level designer."
So I am interesting in his game level design.
It would be fun to explore the key of each level in order to reach the next level.
But I have no idea about how to do that.
Hope to see your game!
"I think that you have a few good ideas about what you want to do, however I am a little unclear on both of them."
1) For the pistol device that you mentioned in idea 2: Why is it a designed to be pistol like?
"If you are worried about negligent or improper behavior in a community, why would you shape your device to look like a deadly weapon?"
"Additionally, could you elaborate a little more on what you meant by patrol device?"
What makes it more or less specialized than a smart phone?
2) For the mobile app: I too find it interesting to manipulate a mobile device to track social and personal habits.
What kind of error proofing will you need to do in order to make sure the mobile app doesn't go off during every quiet situation?
Also what kind of habits are you specifically attempting to track?
The range of personal and social habits is a pretty broad range.
I would choose to help work on their mobile device application.
Although I would try to specialize the app in one particular area like sound and the measurement of decibels.
From there I could branch out into using gps tracking data in order to link connections between the decibel readings and the location of the device.
This could be used to help find good study locations and develop better studying habits.
I think that the student displayed a nicely planned out set of steps that would allow the project to flourished.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would extend the app to maybe act more like a artificial intelligence machine to interact with its users."
The answer in the first idea is pretty vague.
The writer seems more interested in putting down steps for developing an idea rather than actually conceptualizing a project.
"The second question is more thoroughly thought out and visualized, though there are some privacy and safety questions arising from the idea of a private autonomous, or at least mobile, surveillance system."
"The third idea is the most feasible, though I would fins it kind of irritating if my phone kept making personal comments about my habits and randomly playing music suddenly when it gets quiet."
"If the student is serious about creating an app, then maybe we could create a storytelling app with a significant visual element, like a web comic but with some interactivity."
Maybe a choose your own adventure with dynamic visuals and some animation.
They seemed to make a sincere effort and propose three things.
The first being to just simply plan ahead as much as possible.
The second was to create a non profit company organization that hires law enforcement that uses patrol devices.
The third is to showcase a demo of the idea with a mobile app.
"I like the idea of using patrol devices, but this can be risky since I'm sure they will not be cheap and you have to worry about people messing with or breaking or stealing them."
I also like the idea of creating an app as sort of a personal side kick.
I think these ideas are pretty well thought out and practical.
The doorknob thing sounds kinda fun.
Each of these ideas take the concepts and skills we're developing in DC and applying them in imaginative ways.
I'd love to draw storyboards for this person's Great Wall idea.
The idea of displaying cultural history in a visually dynamic way is intriguing to me.
"I think this student really thought through what they could do with the time and resources with a project, and came up with some really interesting ideas."
"I'm not sure if the first one is something I would work on with this student, just because I like to create things that are used and help people."
"Although it's a cool idea, I'm not sure that music or sounds playing when you open the door or touch the handle are something that I would find interesting enough to help on."
"However, I would definitely be able to help with the other two ideas."
"I think the mapping is a great idea, especially in a very cultural way."
You would be able to discover things with the mapping that you wouldn't normally be able to unless you took a trip all the way there which takes time and money.
"I would also be able to work on the last one, also possibly working on a fun animation PSA to spread across the country and the world and hopefully be able to get more individuals involved in saving the Earth's resources."
"Only two ideas were provided, but I did feel the classmate gave adequate descriptions of their ideas."
1.A project that involves touch and sound.
"When individuals touched a door handle, this action would trigger different sounds."
2.Large scale projection mapping.
The project might involve projecting related historical videos on large historical monuments.
The point of this project would be to give tourist the opportunity to learn about history when visiting historical sites.
3.Classmate would like to work on a project that helps people.
The projection mapping project is of the most interest to me.
I believe this project would be best accomplished by developing a large scale projector.
I like the idea of helping to teach the general public about history in a new and exciting way.
"There is definitely some vague writing on the third idea - saying ""I don't know,"" but maybe doing some game - but the other two ideas - interactive touch sensors to trigger sound, and projection mapping onto landmarks - are less vague, but not all that original."
"There are plenty of videos on YouTube with people projection mapping onto various buildings, and plenty of things (including childrens' toys) use touch sensors to make noises."
"Were I to work with this student, I would prefer to do something with the projection mapping."
"Obviously in the classroom/showcase setting we wouldn't be able to project onto anything like the great wall, but we could use the same idea on a smaller scale."
Idea 1 is a selection of art combined into a single project/piece.
Idea 2 is to create new methods of motors to create sustainable energy.
Idea 3 is animated show that is breaking the mold of classic sci-fi.
"The first couple ideas could use a bit more explaining, but the third idea really has some cool aspects to it."
"The animated series could perhaps have a social side to it, adding an app that connects you to the story or character backgrounds and more information behind the scenes."
Allowing for people who are following the series to better connect with the show.
"The three ideas were creating concept art or a single image, developing a energy motor that can run on simple forces, and lastly creating a animated series that won't be like the generic ideas that are on today."
The last idea sounds like something that I would watch to be honest.
Also maybe expand on what kind of programs you use for your designing process.
I would blend the first idea about the concept art and the sci-fi animated series.
I like the idea of the sub-plot of the post-apocolyptic world without a generic lead character.
"I feel I would be able to provide some ideas for story of single episodes and also with the design of the concept art and image design, because that is some of my focus is on digital image editing."
I think he/she seem like a visualist or animator and want to make project is related with visual things.
"However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make."
It was little hard to imagine what project would be.
"However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project."
"Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time."
"I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester."
I think the student could use more time hashing out these installations.
The first is just some sort of projection mapping but doesn't state if it would be interactive or just constant.
The second is for a social network app but doesn't state any specific options or utilities that would distinguish itself from other already in place.
The final idea is more thought out and is focused on humanistic traits and displaying them on a projection.
They don't state what traits or behaviors would be studied but it sounds interesting.
I would try and help this person focus on specific traits or behaviors like people laughing or smiling.
Then I would try to help figure out what we would project on to and how we would capture the specific media.
"The student talks about his/her strengths and areas of interest, which makes it easier to brainstorm what he can do."
The idea for the second question is a bit ambiguous and confusing in terms of goals and focuses.
Is the goal to solve problems with social network or bring awareness to general world issues?
"His three ideas are coming up with ideas for a project, building an app, and an installation that captures human features."
"This person's ideas can lead to one project that is an app which may be used to feature in videos different people around the world, raising the awareness of culture and different societies."
"This student could have gone into a little more detail no how they wish to go about their ideas (what programs they would use), but over all it seems like they took this assignment with sincerity."
"Their first idea however was their least expanded upon thought, and as such should have been thought harder upon."
"I understand their ideas and their direction quite well, so to me they have clearly proposed their points."
"Their ideas: 

One Week: With their love of creating installations they want to create a projection mapped scene unto existing architecture."
Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create an application or social network that is designed to help solve global problems expediently and with relative ease.
"Realistic Semester: An installation that explores human behavior and our physical attributes, as demonstrated by using photography or video through the process of projection mapping."
"Expanding upon your third idea, maybe you could intermix installation, projection mapping, and a phone application."
The phone application could simply ask them to photograph what they look most about their own body and what they dislike most about it before they enter the installation.
When they arrive their phone will be pinged and two new images will be displayed into the giant pile of photos being projection mapped.
"This pile of photos will show everyone's likes and dislikes in their own body, their confidence and their unease, but in the end the general effect would be that all these separate attributes make up what it means to be human."
"So, all of the ideas were extremely vague."
For the week limit I'm not even sure where they would go with it besides doing some research.
"I'm interested to hear more about what they would do to make something that helps with depression, because I think that would be a fun and helpful project to make."
"Again, the public interaction project was also vague and I'm not really sure what else you would need to make people interact with each other in a large area."
"I would also like to hear more about how you would make people feel sound like, would it just be the heavy sounds like bass?"
Or would it be all kinds of notes?
If we were branching out on one of the projects I would probably go off of the machine to help with depression.
I think we'd need to do a lot of research on what there already is out there to help with depression and then see what works and what does not.
"I also think this machine would be a branch off point for helping with it, because if a person were to become dependent on the machine it would not be what we'd be going for."
The ideas here are quite vague.
"They are good ideas, but I think more detail and thought needs to be put forth, in order to really conceptualize what you would want to do."
"The idea in which you would get people to interact in public spaces is a good one, and I would think that we could add visual and audio elements in order to unify people of multiple cultures and backgrounds."
"This could be achieved through the use of music, or even something that can look at a person's face and find someone with similar facial features on the other side of the world."
"They had a very small starting point, as in something they want to address, but not much planning as to how to accomplish it."
Their 3rd idea interests me because I'm interested in creating art spaces that allows the viewer to have an experience.
I don't think that this person has a solid idea yet to achieve a physically sound space though.
I proposed a piece about finding your inner peace/purpose and a key component to it was incorporating sound and lights.
"These are all directions that the student would like to take, but none of them actually mention a project idea."
No project idea available.
"An instillation that allows people to interact and meet each other more easily in a public setting, potentially for the purpose of combatting depression."
"""Something that makes people feel physically sound"""
An instillation that forces people who don't know each other into conversation or close proximity to participate would be applicable.
"One of the issues with depression is connecting with other people, but another is fear, so the instillation would have to be comfortable, inviting, exciting, but needs to also put people together and looking at each other."
"This could be a good starting point for a project for the X-Space next to the design building, a seating solution of some sort."
"There were not really given any detailed ideas, or showed a process to stretch their thinking on the ideas."
The answers were vague and did not show any thought on HOW they would go about curing depression or how to make people physically feel sound.
"In the first idea, it seemed though they avoided answering the question and just showed that they would accept a project for their limits, but what project?"
"As for the cure depression, why not make it be both serious and lighter like use comedy or humor technique to try to cure depression."
"Also expand more on the idea of how to make people physically feel sound, like is it just going to be turning the bass of on speakers or something else entirely?"
Some of the ideas were not clear enough to find a common ground but I would choose the create a interactive system that can help the public interact with others in the same public space.
Something with projection and interactive game environment.
I agree with the severity of drunk driving and the punishment and fines of DUI's so the idea is an interesting idea.
Drunk driving should never be allowed due to the safety of other drivers and the person that is under the influence.
A product that recgonize a person's alcohol level in real time is a good idea.
"However the product your talking about is a breathalyzer, it uses to test out a person's alcohol level."
I believe if you can come up with an app perhaps that has the same function but a different method of testing that would be pretty amazing.
I  like the idea of this product.
I also like the idea of turning A mountain to a display/projector that displays lights and videos.
If you can get enough man power and fundings that would be a great project to work on.
It also represent ASU for it creativity and the teachings that ASU provides for its students.
I like the idea of a product that tests the alcohol level.
The only downside to testing this would be involved in heavily drinking which can be enjoyable but not safe at the same time?
If we can create like a phone application that somewhere tests this it would be a great project to work on.
They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas.
The first would be to go over different plans to try and find the best and most effective one.
The second is to create a device that would allow you to view your blood alcohol level so you can know when to stop.
The third would be to turn a mountain into a giant HD TV.
I really like the idea of having some way for a person to check their blood alcohol levels.
It would be a good idea if it was an accessory for like an iphone that you just pop on to your phone.
"It would also be cool if there was an app associated with it that gave you some tips to pace yourself and once it shows you your blood alcohol level and its quite high, it could calculate how long you should wait until you should have another drink so to not go over the limit."
"I felt that these ideas were clear, and enough detail was provided."
"Idea 1: Classmate believes that they could adequately get through the planning stage of a project, and perhaps further if working in a group."
"Idea 2: Create a device that can measure blood alcohol level in real time, and alert a person when they are too drunk to drive."
Idea 3: Turn a mountain or large piece of architecture into a high definition television.
I think creating a device that measures blood alcohol levels is a great idea.
"I think that if this device were hooked up to the ignition of the car, and physically prevented individuals who were over the limit from driving, that would be even better."
"Out of the ideas this classmate provided, this project would be the one that I would most like to work on."
"One of the ideas was to make a drunk driving device that tells you when your drunk, I believe this already exist but I bet their version would be better anyways."
The other Idea was to turn A mountain into an HD TV which would be awesome and I feel like other schools/cities would follow along If its done successfully.
The 1st question didn't even ask for a project just if we could get some stuff done in a week so this student made a super sincere effort and expressed their ideas fully.
If they could build the HD TV on A mountain and we could use my idea of the mobile mouse case to control it.
Making them famous and giving my product free advertisement in a way would be the greatest collaboration in ASU history.
"This person shows clear thoughts of what she can or would do, especially when she bring in an example like the firefly mirrors in question 2."
"However, the idea in question 2 is vague regarding how the supposed sensors would change a similarly supposed mirror room."
"Her three ideas are a projection mapping of some simple and cheap materials, an interactive installation that deals with mirrors, and collages of human freckles displayed using projection mapping."
"I like the idea of using mirrors in an installation piece and the projection mapping of human freckles, so I would combine these two and work on creating a mirror maze that uses projection mapping to reflect freckles onto people as they walk in the maze."
This student gave a sincere effort in expressing their ideas.
One of the idea was to do some project mapping with freckles and the other project worked with mirrors and lights.
This person really like project mapping and the MAX program.
I feel like we could somehow mix the mirror project with my mobile mouse case to make some type of mirror control device.
Honestly not to sure how we could combine our ideas.
Okay i can sense this person may be interested to work with face-tracking technology.
There is a lot about freckles and mirrors going on here there is a bit of sublime desire to work with the theme of intrapersonal interpretative arts.
"I am not sure if I would think of something interesting to do with the freckles in an audiovisual and/or interactive aspect, to be completely honest."
It depends entirely on the kind of impact you wish to create.
"Say, if it's to spread the message of freckles being beautiful, there may be a way to capture others' freckles with a webcam and maybe using FaceRig: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXylVvwvY94 ; using a registered 3D capture of the freckled person."
"Again, it all depends with the intention of this project's director."
The student made a sincere effort into the project.
"There are three distinct project ideas, two involving projection mapping and another related to peoples freckles.."
Projection map freckles onto a face!
The bubble idea is great.
I wish you gave some more possibilities other then a response to motion just to practice stretching out your thinking.
Now I want to make an installation with bubbles!
"Id suggest using e-textiles in an installation piece as opposed to creating a dress, even though the dress idea would be awesome but in one semester that is a big job."
"We could do a dress for a doll or a mini dress, I think id be more comfortable with that scale for a project."
"But back to the installation with e-textiles, What about a rug, wall paper, curtains, a wig??"
Maybe we can throw some bubbles in there too somehow!
"1) Bubble installation, though it makes no mention of what kind."
"2) No clear idea
3) Was this that dress wearable with the motors?"
"Because if that can get running, that would be awfully neat."
"It seems like they've focused in on making a past project work, and didn't put much thought into the other ideas."
"Frankly, I would love to put together some sort of installation with bubbles."
"It might be interesting to have a machine pumping out bubbles, take video, run it through a max patch (maybe frame differencing?)"
and have the movement of the bubbles synthesize music or colors being projected.
That could be way cool.
"The three ideas are creating a installation involving bubbles based on motion, hiring more people to come up with ideas and choose the best to work with, and lastly creating a dress."
They were all expanded on and they made an effort to explore ideas and gave it a sincere effort.
" I love the idea of the bubbles based on motion, I do love playing with bubbles when I can but this is very interesting because I would love to hear more ideas that you can do with this."
I can't think of any ideas to further the bubbles process but it would be something interesting to explore more.
I also want to hear more about this dress and what you did last semester.
I have actually been on Adafruit myself and worked with EL Wire before when I made a Tron Outfit for a highschool dance.
I was apple to replicate a Daft Punk helmet that lit up and also create a sloppy but functional Tron outfit that lit up and was wearable.
So I would love to hear more about what you are trying to do with this dress and where you would like to go with it.
"I think for the most part the student took the time to really think about the answers, especially pulling from their own experiences."
"I do, however, think that they could have thought about it specifically a little more."
"Although, yes, everyone love bubbles, and it would be a great toy for young kids to have motion-sensored bubbles but I'm not sure it's something that was thought of with a  lot of effort."
"I also don't think that getting money from Bill Gates was thought of, if the money is just going to go to other people to think of ideas."
"Unfortunately, I don't have much interest in working with these ideas unless we expanded on the bubbles idea, or if there was a better explanation for the third answer with more of a digital culture aspect, that we could work together."
"1) Temptation box, ultimately punishing the user and giving no reward."
2) Giant robots!
"3) Humanoid robot

It doesn't seem very fleshed out."
"I've always wanted to build a ""Hall of Presidents""-esque automaton of myself."
It might be interesting to combine this person's robotics skills with my narcissism.
Idea 1: A clear dispenser containing something desirable (maybe even irresistible) that warns people not to use it.
"When used, it shocks the user and plays broken, giving them nothing but a pain in the hand."
Idea 2: A robotic sculpture whose size would compare to their depictions in anime.
"Idea 3: A motion controlled robot, designed to compete in a Japanese competition."
This student has clearly-proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them.
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's idea's involve robots."
"So a joint project could maybe take the form of a robot that is controlled by a virtual control rig, like those used to animation virtual 3d characters in video games and animated films, allowing animators to use familiar controls to design complex motion in a real robot."
"So for idea one, I'm getting that this person would like to mess with people."
It would be interesting to see what people do with a big DO NOT TOUCH button that implies you get a reward if you do touch it.
I think if you went a littler further with the idea you'd probably be able to get some recordings of the people doing it and/or have something else happing if the person does not touch the button.
Idea two/Idea three seems to be what you're set on.
"It would be really neat to see a giant robot but with time/money being an issue a smaller scale one seems do-able, and you already know who you'd like to work with which is awesome!"
"So robots are really neat and I feel like if you're already making a bipedal humanoid robot in the 5 feet range, I feel like there is more work you can put into it to help people out."
"Instead of making it just so that the robot will compete with other robots, it might be cool to also make it so that when it's not in season it can help people who are disabled or something similar."
"Idea 1 is a social experiment that involves pushing a button to get something, but instead you receive a electric shock."
Idea 2 is big robotic sculpture like in anime.
Idea 3 is walking robot that could be used in a Robo competition.
The scope of the last idea is so cool!
I love the idea of the bipedal robo.
I'm not sure what I could propose towards that idea but perhaps having some arduin sensors running that can calculate where faults or weaknesses are.
I love the stretch of thinking between the three ideas.
"For those of us that do not understand anything about robotics and it's terms, I would suggest to expand on your thoughts and ideas."
"The first idea is to have a mourned box visible to people walking by that says ""do not press button""."
At first it seems to have a function such as to produce an item to someone but in reality it just shocks the user.
"The second idea is to create a massive multi story robotic sculpture., I understand the use of sculptures but I would love to hear more ideas on the use of this sculpture."
The third idea is to build a robot with the function to compete in a robotics competition in Japan.
I would love to collaborate on the idea of building a multi-story robotic sculpture.
I would like to incorporate my skills in sound design to find creative ways to have these sculptures interact and produce a certain atmosphere in an area.
The ideas proposed here are more of variations on one idea than three distinct ideas.
The main idea presented here is a depiction of tragedies in human society through audio and video to hope to inspire a change.
I think that if we worked together we could take the message and content and move it to a more personal platform.
"Like a mobile app based instillation, something that takes the experience to a more personal level."
I liked your ideas they seem like a strong place to start.
However are you trying to construct a video project based around American society or around the human society as a whole?
"Either way, I seriously doubt that you will run into problems finding enough video to develop a compilation of tragedies in society."
It sounds like a strait forward plan I look forward to seeing the final result if you end up doing this project.
I think that I would help in finding the video coverage of human tragedy.
My question then would be: how far into history are you planning on covering?
"Also, do you plan on using sound clips from the videos that you find?"
Or are you planning on using voice overs to address the individual events and to maintain consistency throughout the video?
No they did not make an effort to stretch our thinking.
They had the following ideas  - 1.
A grouping of songs that represent tragic events.
A video that does the same thing.
A video with songs that shows American growth.
It looks like they really want to make a video about America.
Maybe if they made the video interactive in some way I would like to help work on it.
So they have an idea but it was not developed or if it was they did not go into significant detail.
Well they seemed to be very interested in video work so it would be great to do a trailer for my game and have the advertisement and product done in one class.
"The ideas are extremely basic, featuring a theme for a project yet no detail on how it would work."
"Each of the ideas talks about making a song or video of American society, seemingly as a growing and tragic community, and doesn't explain how or what will be used to show this opinion."
"The second idea explains what the student's end goal would be, yet nothing about why its important or how it would occur."
"A simple interactive video game would work similarly to a video for showing how American society has changed, with more of a focus on the player feeling the changes through their actions rather than through watching a video."
"This could be tragedies as well, as the game could feature a changing world with both themes."
I really liked the simple ideas of making a painting and hip hop song.
I think that their simplistic and creative natures can be achieved within the confines of the this course.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest producing a video compilation of paintings with corresponding songs."
"Idea one is to make a song or a painting, though then vaguely stated is the ability to do anything."
Idea 2 is developing a better electric car for mass production.
Lastly idea 3 is to develop a Max patch which provides utility to individuals.
"I feel that with idea 3 I could definitely help build a functional Max patch, I would say that's where most of my programming talents lie."
"That would be the immediate application I could provide, however with the billion dollars I would love to work on project number 2."
Previously I've entered an idea into the Edson challenge regarding electric vehicles which I knew wouldn't get anywhere do to it just being a concept.
I like researching and thinking about electric cars and myself am a car guy so it would be awesome to become a co-automaker.
These ideas are extremely general and it is really hard to discern what the thought process is.
"It honestly feels very rushed and that they didn't take the assignment very seriously, or just didn't know what they purpose of the assignment was."
The ideas are very simple to say the least.
1. hip hop song?
digital art?
"Electric car .....
3."
???????
this could be anything
Its really hard to tell what this person can actually do or has interest in because the answers are so robotic.
I would say a program that reads hip hop music and animates something would be the closest answer I could give you.
Yes they worked to stretch our thinking.
their three ideas are - 1.
Turn a song into a painting.
2.  make a good alternative vehicle.
Make a MAX Patch.
I think creating a sweet MAX patch would be fun and useful I would totally work on that.
"The student included a painting of a genre, more efficient electric car, and some sort of max patch."
Not clearly specific but at least they have some sort of idea they see themselves working on..
"I like hip hop too so that sounds interesting, I'd like to get more of a clearer idea of what they were thinking."
The first idea is a simple projection mapping that is motion controlled.
The second idea is to develop interactive home software.
The third idea is to create a chandelier that is then mapped on 3dimensionally.
Combined we could develop a type of projection for household appliances that allows you to turn in and interact with certain ones involving gestures.
"I could provide the visual representation, and more ideas."
"The later two responses had project ideas, the first did not."
Unspecified project involving projection mapping.
"App that acts as a universal remote for a users home, turning on many different appliances just through being there or looking a certain way."
A projection mapped chandelier?
Creating an app that worked as a TV remote would be a good starting point to the whole house controller.
I think he/she has great skills to install interactive media and projection mapping.
"Also, he/her three ideas are clear and related with each other."
These are about the interactive media system that would be realized in present time or in the future.
I think his/her second idea about the Bluetooth stuff is already existed in some luxury apartments or houses.
"However, it would be great project if he/she develop own systems."
I can imagine how his/her project would be fantastic.
"I think it would be better to connect two project, Bluetooth things in the house and imaginations of 3d chandeliers."
"Also, if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, visual and media installation, it would be great project during this semester."
This student made an excellent effort in exploring their ideas.
One of the ideas was to make an app that turns on appliances which is great.
The other two ideas dwelt with projection and mapping which is awesome too.
We could definitely work on that app on turning on appliances with your phone and mix it with my mobile mouse case idea and create something that could put money in both our pockets.
I think this person made a sincere effort to generate ideas for a project.
I am completely unfamiliar with projections mapping and it seems like this person is very interested in it.
"Since I do sculpture fabrication, maybe I could make these comically large chandelier's that have an area like a screen from a tv to project onto."
"Like maybe you can juxtapose a very affluent lifestyle on poor things or vice versa and we could create a room to really take you into the lifestyle of someone below poverty level, and someone in the 1%."
In the first idea they mentioned some sort of arduino that measures temperature?
"I am a little confused but sounds interesting, I don't have much knowledge with those controllers."
"Idea 3 sounds complicated, moving fast in  a game through a controller, how?"
"I am learning programming this semester, so maybe I can help program the game?"
If I learn quickly enough..
The ideas seem interesting.
"However, more details would help clarify your intentions of certain projects."
"They sound cool, but I'd like to know more."
"I think with your knowledge of arduinos, we could make some cool concepts regarding tracking and gaming."
"These seem like a person's scribbled notes, and took me a little bit to decipher."
"They didn't think the ideas all the way trough to the presentation, just the general idea of it."
To me its hard to visualize something if they don't describe the physical parts or generally explain how they would get it done and why it differs from the average idea.
"A computer program thermometer
2."
"3D printing research
3."
Virtual joust?
"Using their supposed knowledge of Arduino, I would assist them in using the data they proposed in getting through temperature in their first idea in order to create a program that reacts to the temperature of bodies within the area."
"The more people there are creating more heat in the proposed area (that people would stand in), would affect an animation's speed."
"The colder it gets and as it is left alone, the animation would slow down as if being frozen in time."
I think that the student made some really good suggestions about creating a arduino program that has some sort of interactive aspect.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest that we extend on the idea of making a arduino program that can sense the temperature and gives some sort of results."
"This person gives a pretty clear idea of what he wants to create, but fails to explain the purpose of creating it."
What would set it apart?
Why make something like this?
Sometimes people don't know about a certain movie so how would you then explain your idea to them?
"1. colored light programmed by arduino
2."
"Virtual Reality gaming
3."
Motion Capture rc car
"I would have this student's knowledge of Arduino assist me in getting together a system that plays a colored light when a person presses a button, but then also takes a picture of that person at that same time; thus creating a ""selfie"" filter that is created instantly like a photobooth."
"Another use for it is we could do long exposure photos, and the user could press certain lights to light the picture before drawing with their LED."
"I felt that although these explanations were brief, and could have used a bit more detail,  the ideas were expressed relatively clearly in such few words."
Idea 1: A program that uses an arduino and three buttons.
"When a button is pushed, an assigned color appears."
Idea 2: A program that makes people feel as though they are part of a virtual reality world.
"The program would involve the whole body, and the user would feel as though they left the real world and were transported into the game."
Idea 3: A program that allows a person to drive a car or fly a plane using only hand movements.
I really liked the idea of a video game that submerged the user into a virtual world.
"I think perhaps with a pair of virtual reality glasses, some sort of smart gloves and shoes, and perhaps some sort of outfit that had different sensors sewn into the material, this might be possible."
"This project would however, likely be very involved, and take a great deal of time and resources to accomplish."
I like your idea of building a simple arduino program with a simple sensor system to interact with the user.
"If I was to work with this student, then I would recommend that we create a system that tracks hand movements but instead of a RC car or plane, we would use a simple robot."
"I think the student made an effort with their ideas, although they could use more information as to what tools they would want to try and use."
"For example, in his third idea, it is unclear as to what softwares or hardware would be needed in order to control the car or plane."
"Reiteration of ideas:
Idea 1 - Using arduino, make an interactive system with 3 buttons that change colors."
Idea 2 - Submerge a user into a virtual reality world.
Idea 3 - Control RC car or plane with hand movements.
"I think it would be possible to use their hand movement idea and incorporate it into some kind of game, perhaps made in Unity."
"A possible idea would be to use the Kinect and have the camera track hand movements, and certain hand movements would control the character/plane/car in a simple game."
I think they tried to streak thinking somewhat.
Their 3 ideas are - 1.
An interactive system with arduino.
Make the matrix.
A digital physical system that tracks movement to control an RC device.
I think creating a system to track movement and turn that into to controls of an RC device or like a game or somthing would be fun.
This has alread been done using the kinect or WII so a new cool way to do it would need  to be devised.
"I had a bit of difficulty understanding the third idea, but overall I felt that Tammy explained her ideas well."
"1.In a week, Tammy would brainstorm, collect data, create a virtual and a paper prototype, and gather information from users and experts regarding her project."
2.Tammy would create a therapy program for children with special needs.
"She would use her resources to hire experts in related fields, and try to create the best program possible."
"3.Tammy would create a mechanism that would record neurological feedback, and heart rate, when a user is exposed to certain stimuli."
"
The project of most interest to me would be working to create a therapy program for children with special needs."
"I know little about this field, but I believe the project would require a great deal of research, and the creation of applicable audio and visuals."
Given the intent of the assignment the student satisfied all the needs and was very thorough throughout the entire assignment.
They had very clear purpose in the entire assignment and were very concise.
In the first idea the student stated the steps that they would go through in order to complete a project in a week.
"In the second idea the student was very clear on what they would do with the money in the answer and what they would use the money for, and to create a machine for special needs children."
The last idea was the student wanting to create a project that records brainwaves.
If me and this student were assigned to work on a project I think that both of us would have to come to a compromise since I am not skilled in the area that the student is speaking of doing a project on.
"I believe that the second idea that the student spoke on is a project that we could actually work on together, and we could also combine aspects of the first and third idea together to make a really cool project."
"It seems that this student detailed how their proposed project for the semester would look in a week, a semester, and in an unspecific amount of time with a billion dollars, rather than proposing three different ideas."
"The idea seems to be to make hardware, like a robot, that mimics the way the human body looks and works, with the end goal of using it to study the form of the body."
"The purpose of studying the form is not clear, though with the types of things this student wishes to do, it appears to be useful for general knowledge of the body for anyone that may want to know, whether artistic or health-related."
"This seems rather hardware-focused for the semester, while my skills focus on software."
"I'd be able to make it into more of an active, functional robot, perhaps as a way to simulate how the human body would move and react to various factors."
This student definitely put a lot of thought into all of their project ideas.
"For the first idea, she goes into what she would do for the first week, such as planning, budgeting, getting the proper equipment, and meeting with professionals in the field she wishes her project to be in."
"As for the project itself, I'm not entirely sure what she is aiming to do."
"She wishes to use neural feedback, as well as feedback from a sensor that gets data from heartbeat."
"For the second idea, it sounds like she would use the billion dollars to get a bunch of experts (in their respective fields) to help create a sort of therapy for special needs children."
She would also have a bunch of equipment to show a progression of their healing/recovery.
"To me, it sounds like idea 2 is a further expansion of idea 1, which totally clears some stuff up for me."
"For the third idea, it's what has been going on for the previous two."
Using data from the brain and the heart to get some sort of outcome.
She was unsure of what is realistic for the time given this semester.
"She didn't propose three different items, but rather one idea that has different outcomes based on her time and money."
Since it's one idea this is easy!
"For a semester, to have us actually work on, we would definitely need some scaling back."
"As far as a sort of machine to measure brain waves, I have no idea how to use it, or where to get one."
This poses a big problem for us.
"As far as something for the heart, this might be a little difficult too."
"I'm not sure if you want an actual heart sensor, and what you need it for."
"They do have pulse sensors (http://goo.gl/7kFhfY) that you can use to measure heart rate, and are used by putting the sensor at either your fingertip or your earlobe."
"The people that created the sensor have a newer version of their product, which may be a better source of a pulse."
"With all this, I'm not sure what you would want to accomplish."
"I'm not an expert on psychological aspects, so I'm not sure what would come out of having these strapped to a person, especially just for the heart sensor."
"You can tell when someone maybe is scared or something, but as far as getting that data and making something out of it, I have no idea."
Especially because you want something that helps special needs children get better treatment I guess?
So the first answer didn't really say anything that this student could accomplish.
It was all very vague and I couldn't figure out what the mobilemousecase project was.
If I knew what this student wanted to work on I would be able to gage what we could do together but I'm not sure what their interests are.
No they did not stretch our thinking.
No idea 2. go to Dubai  3.
A mobile mouse case.
"I dont really know what the mobile mouse case is but going to Dubai sounds like fun,  I had a blast last time I was there."
I like the Dubai Vacation for brainstorming.
I feel that you need to have diversity and variety of locations to brainstorm ideas.
If theres ever a trip like that count me in!
As far as the mobile mouse case idea goes I think you should finish the product.
I saw the pitch and the progress in the previous semester and it is an interesting product.
The only idea that you had was finishing up the mobile mouse case and it seems like your are really focused on getting this prototype finish I would like to collaborate on this product to get this finish if we had to work together.
The student said that he/she can finish lots of things in a week.
But it depended on the resources.
Go to Dubai for brainstorming.3.
Mobile mouse case!
Sounds cool and I hope you can tell more details about it.
I don't know what mobile mouse case is.
It sees like you can use your mobile as a mouse.
Very interesting.
Hope you can do it!
It sounds as if you have one solid idea.
Could you elaborate a little more on it?
"You call it your mobile mouse case, so what exactly makes it specialized?"
I'm pretty sure I couldn't contribute very much.
"By the sound of it, this student has a pretty good grasp on what they plan on doing."
However if they were accepting help I might be able to help craft the project.
I spent a year in industrial design crafting prototypes and I might be able to lend a hand in the actual making of this product.
I would team up with this person and try to figure out a way to record and add video clips into a short loop composition that could be layered similar to how audio can be recorded and looped.
I could just have certain opacities when I record 3-4 different clips and it would create something different and new every time to project.
"Some of the ideas were successful, and some weren't."
I think their idea 2 was the strongest.
I really liked the idea 2.
"We would definitely have to modify it, but I think that within our own phoenix community there are a lot of dichotomies physical appearances."
The person didn't put too much thought into this one.
The first idea is to create a small digital physical system or installation that looks cool.
The second idea is to connect everyone by creating a internet infrastructure that uses solar/kinetic powered equipment.
The third idea is to simply create a interactive mobile phone app.
"If we were to work in a group, I would try to blend the ideas of a digital physical system, the app, and the internet infrastructure to somehow create some sort of interconnected environment that is connected to all and is controlled by the phone app."
This could be used to interact with others within the environment to do whatever the user wants.
"For example, if someone walks into the environment, I could trigger a device to turn on from my app on the phone."
I don't really feel like this student stretched the thinking on this assignment.
The effort was barely made for this assignment.
I don't know what this student wanted to do so I'm not sure how we could collaborate.
A game or installation is very vague.
"Their ideas are far too vague, I can't really start to picture what they had in their mind from this limited explanation."
I am not too sure they too this assignment with the utmost sincerity.
"That being said, the general idea of what they wish to accomplish is quite clear due to its concentration of words."
"However, many questions about their ideas exist."
Why do we need a new internet infrastructure?
What type of game/app do you want to develop?
"What type of installation do you wish to build, and with what tools?"
"Their ideas: 

One Week: A small digital installation that has physical elements to it."
Unlimited Time and Money: To create a new infrastructure for the internet that allows for everyone to be connected using solar/kinetic power as its power source.
Realistic Semester: To create an interactive mobile game.
Maybe you could mix your first and third idea for a mobile application that interacts with your physical installation.
People could download the app and answer a few questions (like what did you eat for breakfast?)
"and when they arrived at the installation you could scan for their device, pull their questionnaire, and projection map objects that correspond to them (like waffles if that's what they had for breakfast)."
"The beauty of it would be that other participants in the installation would not know that you were to the one would had waffles, so it would provide a level of voyeurism to each of the participants allowing them to look into someones life without not who they were looking at."
"The student here is perhaps overly succinct, but seems confident that they can create something worthwhile over the course of the semester."
I really like the idea of trying to increase and improve internet connectivity in this country.
Other industrialized countries have bandwidth and speed that put us to shame.
Replacing all of the old copper lines with fiber would be awesome!
"If the student goes with creating a game I'd love to do character and concept sketches, storyboards and other visual aspects."
"Idea 1 is to make a graphic that they would paint on their motorcycle, from design to finish."
Idea 2 is a movement to get people more active in the US.
Idea 3 is app that connects motorcycle enthusiast to each other.
The app is a great idea because as far I know there are none out there for motorcyclist enthusiasts.
For the project you could even combine the idea of graphics for motorcycles and use the app to share cool projects that people may be working on or want to collaborate on.
I think the student put in effort but the ideas are still very vague for idea 2 and 3.
Idea 1 - The idea mentioned painting the body of his motorcycle.
Idea 2 - The idea mentioned creating a project that would make people more physically active.
How would you go about promoting that?
What motive would people have to jog instead of drive somewhere (especially when your destination is very far away)?
Idea 3 - The idea mentioned creating a social media app for motorcycle riders.
"Need more information on what this app does, what software/programming language you are using, etc."
"Combining these ideas is somewhat tricky, since they seem to conflict with one another."
"On one side, you are trying to persuade people to be more physically active, but on the other side, there seems to be a big interest in motorcycling."
"If I had to extend on one of your ideas though, I'd maybe incorporate features to your social media app that not only talk about motorcycles, but also inform the public about being more physically active."
"I feel that all of their ideas could have been expanded upon, and I am not really sure what they had in mind for their second idea."
What will this campaign to promote activeness entail?
Would their be commercials and public events to help promote activeness?
How will people commute to work?
Will you design an Arcology and thus eliminate cars altogether?
"I could feel the sincerity behind their words, but they could have been a little more concrete with this desires, this would have helped in the clarity of their plans."
"Their ideas: 

One Week: They would either design a decal or paint a mural on their motorcycle."
"Unlimited Time and Money: They wish to create a project that somehow makes people more physically active, they wish for this project to lower to usage of automobiles (and thus leading to less pollution and car related deaths)."
Realistic Semester: A social media app that acts like an internet forum for motorcycle rides and those who just generally love motorcycles.
I mentioned designing an Arcology when referencing your second idea (making people more active).
Maybe we could work that into your project this semester.
"Obviously you could not make such a structure in a semester, however maybe you could draw up some blueprints for it."
You could design it so that people would not have to use cars to get anywhere with everywhere being accessible by walking or elevators.
"You could look up how to make a self sufficient Arcology and try to incorporate that into your blueprints, was well as where you would place emergency services, housing, commercial, and schools."
I really do believe that this student made a sincere effort with this assignment and thinking about what they really want to do in these situations.
I think that they really dug deep in thinking what they would want to do based off of what they love to do with their hobbies.
I think that we could really collaborating on something here.
"For one, I love print design and working in Illustrator to create fun graphics, so I think we would be able to collaborate on motorcycle designs to possibly sell!"
"I also believe we could make an awesome animation for a health PSA, since I would want to do an animation for my answers last week, and they want do get the word out for people to be healthier, we could collaborate and make a really fun animated PSA about it, and with the money given to us, that we would be able to use it for advertising and getting celebrity endorsements."
I believe the student put in a lot of effort but I only seem to see two distinct ideas.
My DC concentration is in “sound” so I would be very interested in finding a way to incorporate his sound project.
I think that you have some good ideas.
I really liked the first idea that you came up with it sounds as if you have put some thought into it.
"As for your second idea, would it be possible to empower these communities with a simplified version of your plan."
"When I think of the struggles that these communities have to deal with, my first notion is not that they are in need of jobs."
Couldn't you help provide these communities with the means of acquiring power without setting up a full on power plant?
"Is there a cheaper, more dispensable means of creating a power generating device for these communities?"
"Much like the paper water filter book, could you develop something that could provide usable energy at a low cost?"
"I like your enthusiasm, and I would definitely work on a project with you if you brought this kind of attitude into a group project."
I too would choose to work on a project that could extend beyond the classroom into helping the outside world with what I have learned within the DC program.
Last year I worked on developing a garden that took care of itself with the help of an arduino.
"However this proved to be a really difficult project for only one person to work on, and was never completed to it's full potential."
"Therefore if you happen to stumble across an idea that your really feel passionate about, I would be on board to help make it happen."
"The three ideas were creating a short film that can inspire and also intrigue an audience, help make the world a better/happier place without the use a pharmaceutical drugs, and to learn more of the side of engineering and development."
"Some of the answers were pretty vague, like what type of film do you think would be inspirational, what type of audience or culture would you like to base it off of or target the film to?"
What do YOU think can make the world happier?
Just try to expand more on these ideas and it would help.
I would like to start with the idea of the short film and trying to make the world a happier place.
I feel that an inspirational short film can help the world or a group of people feel happier.
What would we base it off of and what target audience would we push it towards?
Didn’t go much in depth on any of the ideas.
Pretty vague.
Not sure since I can’t seem to figure out what the projects are exactly.
"The student actually made a sincere effort and I believe gave very honest answers, except for the third answer, the student didn't really answer the question or give an idea."
"The student actually clearly proposes two things, the first idea was about making an inspirational film, the second idea was about researching what makes a human happy without drugs, and to make a device that trains the human brain to think in a positive and non negative way."
I believe that with the first idea is definitely something that both me and the student could work on.
"I love films and I love working on films, I think that could definitely be a fun project to work on with someone else, I also believe we could combine elements of the second idea in order to make an inspirational film about how people can be happy and train themselves to think in more positive ways."
Your film idea is kind of vague.
"Inspirational can be so many things to so many people, you might want to focus on a specific topic over everything else."
"For your second idea, a ton of research would need to be made."
"You said you'd like to make the world happy with out the use of pharmaceutical drugs which makes me think you're also trying to have something that will help fight depression, not just boredom or sadness."
A thing to keep in mind is that the brain holds onto more negative thoughts than positive.
The third idea almost sounds like you'd like to know more about developing a program?
"I'm not really sure what you'd want to accomplish, but you should look for a group that is well rounded, and pay attention to your developers."
I like the idea about making people happy and I know there is someone else who would like to do something similar to that in this class.
What I think I would do first with this idea is to set a specific group (like college students around campus) and just go out and start interviewing.
If you have a set list of questions its easy to just go up to someone and ask for some input.
"The good thing about starting on campus is that there are so many students from all different backgrounds, you'll start to get that wide variety of research you're looking for."
"In the first idea, they clearly propose they would make a short film that was inspirational and intriguing to an audience."
"The only thing about this is, different people feel different emotions."
What is intriguing to one person could bore the living hell out of another.
The second idea is basically saying they want to make people happy!
Without the use of any drugs.
I fully support this idea.
"There isn't really a third idea, just the student saying that they want to work more with the development side of things."
"I really would love to go off of the whole making people happy thing, but again, emotions are very subjective."
"Unless we actually had something that is proven to effectively make different people happy each time they use this product, it wouldn't work well."
"I mean, we could take a survey of everyone in DC and ask them what they think is funny, or what makes them happy, and you can make a short film on it?"
The student clearly proposes three separate ideas.
"For the first, the student's idea is for a short film."
"While they don't say what the topic will be, they do say that the short would not include explosions or CGI of any sort."
"For the second idea, the student would spend the money on something that could give clean water, or make self driving cars."
The third idea was to create music.
So the second idea is definitely not in reach for a semester.
You could combine the first and third ideas though.
"Obviously a short film would have some sort of sound, but maybe you could make a short film documenting how much you learn about music?"
I think he/she seem like a visual artist and want to make project is related with visual things.
"However, it was hard to realize and imagine that is actual project that he/she want to make."
It was little hard to imagine what project would be.
"However, I agree with a week would be short week to develop a project."
"Also, some project could not make with unlimited fund and short time."
"I think you are good visualist and if you collaborate with other designers such as sound, media installation, and animator, it would be great project during this semester."
"Moreover, you can make plant to connect these three ideas that visual, clean water or self driving system, and music stuff."
These are would be great project to interective each system to make human life better.
Idea 1: a short film discussing a topic of interest.
"Idea 2: Work to organize and fund the creation of something that could provide clean water to people, or use a similar process for a different issue."
Idea 3: Make music.
"Though the specifics are a little vague, this student has proposed three ideas and has touched on the details and motivations for them."
"My ideas involve 3D animation, and this student's ideas involve filmmaking, humanitarian organization, and music making."
So a joint project might could take many forms.
"Humanitarian concerns can be (and are commonly) addressed in both film and music, and animation can go with both."
"Maybe it is an animated short film (or at least partially animated), or maybe it is an animated music video to a song or series of songs."
The student wrote vaguely about their own motivations and didn't really provide any ideas for a project.
There aren't any proposed ideas to go off of to make into a project
"1) Vague notion of video editing
2) vague notion of humanitarian efforts
3) Vague notion of creating music."
"Basically, it's pretty vague."
Maybe something with iterative video?
Take video of people wanting previous participants and do some sort of synthesis using the similarities (or differences).
"Idea 1: an interaction based installation that incorporates data from different devices, or robotic display."
Idea 2: work to develop cheaper hardware to benefit future designers and problem-solvers.
"Idea 3: A screen made up of a grid of independent, hanging LEDs that move to emulate the reflection on the water in a glass in response to a participant disturbing it."
"My ideas involve animation, and this student's ideas involve a robotic screen that reacts to participants' interactions."
So a joint project might take the form of an installation that incorporates animations expressed in physical 3D on a robotic screen and viewer interaction.
"The student said they could make some sort of interactive installation, something robotic, or a matrix made of LEDs for the first idea."
"For the second idea, the student said that instead of one huge project, they would would work on making what we have easier to make and at cheaper costs."
"This way, more people could make things to solve more problems."
"For the third idea, I kind of don't understand it, but that's totally on me because it seems like they know what they are talking about."
I'm just not sure the final outcome.
"To be honest, pretty sure I'm not on this person's level, neither thinking, or actual like tinkering."
"Obviously you could blend the first and the third projects because you mention an installation, lights, and robotics."
"I'm not sure how interactive the third idea is, but maybe instead of a camera looking at the hanging LEDs from below, it can look at it from above and have people walk under the lights?"
"This way like if someone is walking and the lights are hanging too low, you can move them up with the pulley system you were mentioning."
And use a Kinect to measure distance.
First idea is to develop an interactive light show or system.
"The second idea is to find ways to make things that are expensive and time consuming to do now, cheaper and more efficient."
"The third idea is to okay with light, water, and perception."
Together we could create some kind of interaction between a physical and digital system.
"The person has a broad range of interests, but I feel that the first two responses are really vague since they talk about what kind of projects they want to work on rather than what projects."
"Also, what they specified in the first question may be something that would be more than they can handle in one week."
The third idea is much clearer as they explain their project and its structure and functions.
"Their three ideas are some project that deals with electrical devices, a cheap hardware to help people, and a mechanical display that moves in fluid-like motion."
"The third idea has a lot to work with, so I would like to extend that into a large art piece that can be placed at a water show or a museum of machines."
"I think it would be interesting to see the inner working, like cables and light connections, to give the display some flair too."
"Yes, I think they though deeply about what they could and would do."
"I know nothing about music and theater, but maybe with my sculpture skills we could design a set."
"Although the set would be here in Tempe, it could reference South Korean theater and draw attention to the South Korean theater community both here and abroad."
There is great expanse on ideas and passions in this idea run.
The first idea is to use MAX/MSP to create a sound to light interactive system.
The second idea is to create a theatre company that can reproduce the quality of theater performances here in america in countries without significant funding for musicals and theatre performances.
The third idea is to create new content for a musical play.
I have created musical compositions for musicals in the past and I would love to be a part of a team to create new content for musicals.
It would also be a privilege to find a way to create a good quality theatre performances in other countries.
"I found this classmates ideas interesting, but had difficulty understanding the details, and how their ideas would be accomplished."
"In a week, this classmate would brainstorm and ask key questions about their project."
They are most interested in working on a project that connects sound and visuals.
"This classmate would like to create an infinite theatre, with an interactive component."
The theatre would involve state of the art equipment and take up an unlimited amount of space.
"In a semester, this classmate would create an interactive performance scene."
If I were to work with this classmate I would be most interested in working with him to create an infinite theatre.
"This idea sounded interesting, but I couldn’t quite understand the details or picture the end result."
"I think this project would involve a great deal of technological and artistic components, but I would need to have a better understanding of the project to know what was needed to physically accomplish it."
"The person has given thought to it, but doesnt describe the ideas quite enough."
The first idea is to create a graphic novel.
The second idea is to create a cartoon from the characters he/she has already created.
The third idea is is to ultimately create a graphic novel.
"All of the ideas have to do with either graphic novels or cartoons, so why not create a connection."
Make a book that has the cartoon within it.
"Create a book, then put a screen within it, and instead of having a regular graphic novel, the cartoon appears."
"1) Graphic novel
2) full cartoon
3) Webcomic leading into graphic novel."
I would have liked more detail on each idea.
None of these are fleshed out enough for my liking.
"Perhaps a more augmented graphic novel, with thick ""pages"" for sensors and actuators, so we could provide sound effects (using tiny speakers) and some motion (motors under paper)."
Like the pop-up book of the future.
I can see where this student was heading.
So there ideas were thoughtful but just not expressed deeply through the assignment but it is obvious they have passion for this project.
Well they appear to be interested in graphics and rich story line.
We could certainly make a roleplaying game out of their novel.
"I think he/she seem like a visual artist, especially 3d animator or interactive media."
I can imagine this interactive media system relate with human body.
I think 3D animation project is so many potential energy in diverse field like he/she is interested in human psychology.
I can imagine how his/her project would be great if these three ideas will be developed.
"To make a go of it, I think he/she has to collaborate with kind of artists such as media installation, sound, or performers."
These project ideas are impressive for me and it would be very helpful to make human life better if you develop his/her own system in this semester.
I just have NO idea of what this person is saying.
Read above.
The first idea would be to develop a 3d character.
The second idea is to develop a full length animation that is intense and far beyond a few month's capabilities.
The third one is to build upon your skills as an animator and develop something you're proud of.
"We could develop some sort of animation together, as I had done a lot of animation work myself."
The student gave an honest and sincere effort and I believe gave some great answers.
The student clearly proposes three ideas in their post.
The first idea that the student proposes is essentially making a virtual character (which I think is really cool).
The second idea was also a digital animation idea on making a very detailed video game.
The last idea was about creating a digitally constructed visual.
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate for the semester I think we could make some very cool digital visuals because this student seems to be very experienced in making digital visuals and I am very artistic and creative and I think I could help this student with some great ideas for visuals that he could actually make on the computer.
Didn’t go into much depth besides speaking of animation.
3D animation and psychology.
Maybe a project that uses animation to help some sort of psychological disorder?
There are three ideas proposed with significant information for me to understand the ideas.
The first idea is to create a website or game.
The second idea is to create a virtual world with content that mirrors this world.
I love the idea of replicating an reliving historical time periods.
The third idea is to create a game with intelligent AI that can replicate a human player.
I would collaborate with this student to create real stimulating sound for the virtual world idea.
One of the most important parts of our experience and reality is the 5 senses.
I would want to make sure the sound design is perfectly matched to how it is in reality.
The larger proposed idea is the creation of an entire virtual world and simulator that would allow for the user to transport themselves anywhere.
The second idea is making a video game that centers around AI making it seem as if the computer's AI could be a human.
"The second idea is basically a smaller version of the first, larger idea."
I think that this student and I could work very well together.
"My background is in computers and computer programming as well, I think we could take the smaller idea as is and make it into a full blown project."
All of your ideas seem to be based around developing some sort of game or program.
"It isn't that I don't find these ideas interesting, however what other projects might you be open to?"
"For example, with your second idea: Would you take it a step further and utilize the Oculus Rift headset?"
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to offer you much assistance with your project.
"Although I have some experience developing games and programming, I have a very limited knowledge on the subject."
"However if you needed somebody to help craft something or to help develop character designs, I could be the man for the job."
The first idea is to do some programming for a video game.
The second idea is to create a very high end video game.
The third idea is to create a less high end video game than in idea 2.
We could make a videogame.
"This student made a very sincere effort and gave some very interesting answers, the student clearly proposed three ideas."
The first idea is about showcasing project mapping by using max msp.
The second idea is an interactive gaming system for children in hospitals that involves a digital environment.
"The last idea was creating a new way of playing video games that eliminates ""screen watching""."
If me and this student were assigned to collaborate together for the semester I would like to explore the possibilities of the students' last idea that involved a new way of playing video games with the cube that involves the first idea and some elements of the second idea.
It is very apparent that this person to the time and effort to sincerely answer all three idea questions.
They go into detail on what they exactly want to accomplish as well as what tools they would like to use for their project.
I could very easily get a picture in my head for each of their three concepts and thus believe they explained their points clearly and concisely.
"Their ideas: 

One Week: They wish to using projection mapping for either an art gallery or to show off their own line of clothing."
They would use Max msp to facilitate the projection mapping and would plan on using video.
Unlimited Time and Money: The wish to create a digital environment projection mapped into a room that children in hospitals and explore and play with using their hands or feet instead of controllers.
Realistic Semester: A cube that would not allow the transgression of video game screen looking to cheat when planing with friends.
This cube will have each player's perspective projection mapped on a different face making nigh impossible to catch a glimpse of what your friend in doing.
"I think your anti screen looking project idea is amazing, too often I have caught my younger brother committing this cardinal video game sin."
"The cube was a great idea, ignoring the top and bottom of the cube you have 4 surfaces and with video games often offering 4 player co-op you can projection map on each of the sides."
"you can make the cube sort of a furniture piece, coming with chairs (maybe cubes as well), and a way to easily store it+its projectors."
"I can not help you on the lines of knowing Max, but I think you should think ahead a bit to on how you could market such an awesome device/piece of furniture."
"The cube look could work as a ""futuristic"" vibe and that alone could be enough to get people interested."
You could also make it so that it could be installed in arcades or bars allowing people to play games with friends or strangers.
"This person has a major interest in projection mapping and interactive environments, this could be relatively easy to work with the appropriate direction and resource management."
"Even if there is an inclusion of a clothing brand, the proposals are concise and clear."
"My way-far-out-you-are-insane addition: let's make a completely projected room from the outside-in, possibly using something like four white cloth sheets and project a 3D space from outside and possibly add some sort of motion tracking mechanism with objects or the people."
"My bound-to-earth proposal: yeah, let's do that."
You have a good grasp on what you'd like to do.
As long as you're comfortable with projection mapping I believe that all of your ideas will work.
"I'm not exactly sure what you would do with the art gallery, but if you've made some pieces of you're own you could make them pop using the projection."
I also like that you're thinking of working with kids.
"You can do a lot with the idea of making an interactive environment around them, and even make it so that they can visit different places around the world from their own bed."
The only thing I'm concerned about with the xbox is the split screen projection mapping.
You might have to work with 2 different projectors.
I'd want to work more with your clothing brand idea.
If you have some physical objects that people could model you could take video of that and then build a runway like stage to make an infinite runway.
Along it you could use projection mapping on some mannequins along the way so that people can look at what you have.
"The student's first idea is to carve a unique wolf sculpture, idea two is vague but has an endgame of creating an emotionally evocative space for individuals, and lastly idea 3 is to create an installation."
"I do not think that I could help out with project 1 in much of a way as I do not have any carving experience, but possibly I could assist in the formation of ideas 2 or 3."
"The ideation seems pretty confident with project three so I think I could only assist in the actual physical construction of the installation, it doesn't seem like there would be much software involved."
In idea 3 I could possibly help in the ideation process and define a solid idea of what the implemented project actually will be.
This is the most well thought out and fully realized pitches for an idea I've read so far.
"The carving of a wolf sounds like a lot of fun, but also a lot of work."
"The space installation sounds fascinating, especially the concepts being conveyed by the piece."
I honestly don't know what I'd have to offer this student as far as her project goes.
She seems to have her concepts and procedures and work steps pretty thoroughly planned out and there's not much of a visually element that would make my drawing skills necessary.
They made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas.
The first idea was to carve a hyper realistic figure of a wolf.
The second was to create some sort of environment that creates something eco-friendly.
The third was to create a frame to a viewer could see the light in some creative way.
The idea about creating the frame sounds very unique.
I would like to see something like that.
This student can definitely go different ways into what type of project he or she wants to do.
"However, I think that maybe he or she should stick to some sort of project that has to do with geometry or coding or both."
"If I was to work with this student, then I would suggest focusing on a geometry oriented project."
"The person has definitely thought about it, and although the second idea doesn't have an exact project, the idea is there."
The first idea is to make a sculpture.
The second idea is to somehow create a way to emotionally connect with other people using technology of some sort.
"The third idea is to create an installation that in short, involves a light and it delivers a message about personal serenity."
I'm not really sure how I could tie these together honestly.
"The ideas are very different, but maybe I'm just not thinking outside the box enough."
"However, I am thinking that maybe you could just smash all the ideas together, creating the installation with the sculpture instead of the light and it allows people to feel what others are feeling."
I'm not really sure though.
Time travel has always been an interest of mine.
"That being said, and Alternate Timeline Transportation Device sounds pretty cool."
"Paradoxes are no fun, so this seems like a much more safe alternative."
"I'm not sure exactly what we could work on, but it seems like we both have similar interests based on the responses (Twitch, gaming, time travel) so the ideas would definitely be alike."
This person shows really fun ideas that may or may not be simple but are interesting to see.
The ideas are quite clear with specific features.
"Their three ideas are simultaneous video game plays, virtual reality device that allows changes in the user's past, and an interactive display with a projection mapping of a mermaid."
The interactive system featuring the mermaid and the inverse of Twitch Plays Pokemon seem like two appealing ideas that can be blended.
"I am thinking that the project could be an installation of tv and projector such that a video game console is hooked up to a tv, which has a projection mapping of a mermaid on the screen."
"Whatever button a user presses on their console, the button can affect the mermaid's behaviors."
The first idea was linking multiple consoles together to be able to play multiple video games from one console.
The second idea is to develop an alternate timeline device that would allow users to experience their lives if they made different decisions.
The third idea is to develop a virtual mermaid tank in which the mermaid would react dynamically to the environment.
I think we could take the last one and turn it into a project this semester.
The equipment is already easily available and it wouldn't be much of a stretch to bring this project to life with the correct sensors and programming.
I think these are some interesting ideas but they are a little over my head.
The first is for some Pokemon game but I'm not too familiar with Pokemon games but i like the idea of projecting older games onto surfaces to give them a new feel.
The second idea is for a alternate timeline which sounds cool but I'm confused how it would be executed.
The last is for an interactive mermaid projection which seems to react to sound and motion.
The last idea seemed the most doable I would try and focus on scope of the project though.
Would it be life size or smaller?
How would it work in a crowded room?
How many reactions would the mermaid have?
"All three responses are good ideas, even if idea #2 is currently technologically infeasible."
A setup that allows a player to play 5 simple games at once as an interesting experience.
A device that allows users to jump between timelines/ dimensions to try out different actions or choices in life.
A tank with a projection mapped mermaid inside that reacted to people in a room.
"I think that the mermaid tank idea is really interesting, though it would likely be rather difficult."
"Making a prototype of this however could be feasible in a semester or two, where a smaller or simpler object or the skeleton of the mermaid model could be mapped into a special fish tank."
The ideas are definitely clear as they are and feel well thought-out.
"The first idea is a stand to hold various electronic devices and chargers on a stand, specifically next to a bed."
"The second idea is a low-cost wearable device that generates energy through being outdoors or exercising, potentially solving both energy and health problems through motivating people to exercise to charge their electronic devices."
"The third idea is a game in which the student does most of the artistic work (art, models, environments, etc), and although the exact design of the game is not clear, it appears the student would prefer to work on a shooter of some sort."
"As a game developer and programmer, I would be able to work with this student to create a game, given their lack of experience in programming."
"However, 'create a game' is incredibly broad, as games vary greatly based on their genre and theme, so it's difficult to lay out what type of game we would make; I would need to know more about this student's interests and what their goal is for the game."
You'd like to make a stand to reduce the clutter of electronics.
"The problem with it is that there is stuff already kind of like that, and organizers already made."
If you do make it so that its all contained with in the nightstand it could be really neat and even marketable.
For your second idea I think solar energy would be your best bet because I'm not sure of how you could take energy from the body and transfer it into a battery.
"With this idea, any article of clothing could be used for quick energy which would be pretty neat."
The big problem I see is the lack of comfort from the clothing that you might get with attaching batteries and other things.
"People probably won't want to wear it if it's uncomfortable, especially if its hot."
"The third Idea seems to be thought out, but I'm not sure what your concept is for the game."
If you're good with animation you might be able to make a trailer that would spark interest for programmers.
I think the biggest part before moving onto working with the occulus rift is to find that group to make your trailer and create a small part of the game.
"I like the idea of a hat or shirt that gathers electricity and i would want to branch off more on that, more because I'm not really sure about you're game idea, but I'd also like to learn more about it."
"As for the clothing, I think a big thing is focusing on the overall design of the clothing, to make sure that people would wear them."
I also think development of a solar battery would need to go into the shits/hats/pants as well.
"Things to consider is if they need to be connected to the shirt at all times, how heavy they would be, and if the article are machine washable."
The student made a very good effort on his/her thoughts.
"All three ideas were detailed and gave the reader a good ideas as to what the student would want accomplished, and possible tools that would be used in order to accomplish their goals."
"Reiteration of ideas:
Idea 1 - Creating a model of a stand to hold all of his electronic devices and chargers by his bed to watch from."
"Idea 2 - Creating wearable technology that is attached to the clothing that gathers solar, body heat, and kinetic energy, as a source of energy that could be stored into a battery."
"Idea 3 - Creating a virtual reality game for the oculus rift, likely a first person shooter, that also uses a suit, fans, and other devices to simulate a more realistic experience."
I think part of his third idea would likely be a good choice for a semester/year long project.
A group of people would definitely be able to create a virtual world using Unity to create a simple first person shooter.
This project could possibly be taken even further depending on the time and try to incorporate the coding needed to make this game usable with the Oculus Rift.
The student could use more time to get more specific with the ideas.
The first just states what they would work with not exactly what they would make.
"The second is for a system that automatically tended to a garden, I was wondering how this would be done."
The last is for an interactive sculpture which seems interesting.
I would try to help this student get more specific on there goals.
What is the end result?
How would you want people to feel?
What would the sculpture be or do?
"The ideas here aren't too fleshed out, but you've already begun to think about what things you would want in order to make something."
"Consider finding the limits of the technology, and go down from there."
I really like the arduino planting idea.
"I'm not really sure what I add at this point, but the idea is interesting and could really find a use in different businesses around the world."
There are only two kind of vague ideas presented here.
The first is a garden that would take care of itself utilizing an Arduino to do the physical work.
The second is an interactive sculpture of some sort with no other details.
I think it would be feasible to build something like an interactive sculpture using sensors and computers to do the calculations and alter the sculpture.
The student put in a lot of time and effort into his/her ideas.
"Although these ideas are very detailed with what the student wants accomplished in the end, ideas 2 and 3 need more information as to what exactly Digital Culture students would be doing during the semester/year to apply their skills, aka, the ""engage and make it fun"" and ""find a way to expand"" needs work."
I do understand the overall goal but this needs more explanation as to what a group of 4 students would be doing exactly.
"Reiteration of ideas:
Idea 1 - Complete composition of two songs for cinematic, game, or advertisement."
Idea 2 - Create campus ministries in all of the universities in America to establish relationships with the campus and business in the respective state.
Idea 3 - Build partnerships with organizations and expand The Respect Movement to other campuses.
"Since your first idea seems to show an interest in creating music, I think you could tie this in with ideas 2 and 3."
"As an example, use the semester to create a song, maybe even a music video, to promote ideas 2 and 3."
"This music video could use projectors, cameras, and software that the digital culture has available to students."
Your idea is very deeply thought out.
Religion is an important aspect in an individual's life and it can help one out through college experience.
I know the feeling of being wanting to fit into a group or service that you are interested and passion about.
"Your project seems very interesting, not everyone will agree to religion but they will agree to a community build upon passion"
I would be interested in seeing how far this project would go.
I want to see the process of this project campaign and how it is develop.
The ministry service is an project that look like it would grow by time not so sure about how big but I would like to contribute someway to see that project grows.
This person made a sincere effort to express their ideas.
This persons ideas were about creating clubs and organizations to help teach respect and other important things to our ASU students.
These are some awesome ideas but I would try and leave religion out of it.
I am not at all that religious but I would do my best to help set up these clubs and organizations.
If they need an app or something I could help out and mix my idea into it but other than that I just don't see us collaborating.
The person has definitely thought of what they wanted to do.
"Although, I'm honestly not sure how exactly it would tie into digital culture."
I do see potential in it though.
"Maybe some more thought about what digital culture is about, then try and make something that ties directly to that idea."
The first idea is to basically make a song for someone.
The second idea is to create an organization kinda like the Newman Center but better.
The third idea is to become more connected with other campuses to create a more equal culture.
I think that maybe we could tie in the songs with individuals and their need for equality.
"I guess what I am saying is that we could make an installation that scans someones face, then according to their structure or facial expression, it would create a song for that person."
"Not sure if the second idea is really for the billion dollars if not simply use $100 and get away with $999'999,900 at hand, but hey, honestly I would like some of that cheddar too."
"But I digress:

This person has obvious interests in using projection mapping as a central thematic and makes absolute sense."
"Except, again, for the eyebrow-raising budget of a billion dollars for a simple project like that."
"I am intrigued by the project on the third bullet, only thing that keeps me wondering how well it would work is just the movement part because part of the illusion of space involvements like this is kinesthesic activity."
SO!
Introducing Virtuix Omni: a treadmill specifically designed of VR movement.
"http://www.virtuix.com/

Perhaps using this could help with the production, albeit I am not sure if it would work way much better using Oculus Rift as well, which might just ruin the point of creating a projected environment outside."
"But I digress, I can sense something brewing."
"The ideas of a physical object that can be projected on with animations that can cater to the shape, a cloth or outfit that can be tracked and projected onto for plays and musicals, and a Immersive animation sequence that give the persona  sense of being in the POV of the character."
You did give this sincere effort and I do like the three of your ideas.
I actually love the idea of the clothing that can be tracked and projected onto.
It sounds extremely difficult but since your given a billion dollars I'm sure you can accomplish it.
I would like to go with the immersive environment animation because it coordinates well with my idea of make an immersive environment for sick children in a Child's Hospital.
"I feel if we made an animation sequence that can give the children a sense of POV of the character on their journey, that could greatly be helpful for them."
"Since most of the children do not have access to such adventures, we could make an immersive environment that can give them a sense of adventure."
"Also incorporate the clothing onto the child so say the child is a knight on a quest, the immersive environment would be projected onto the surrounded and a knight's outfit or armor can be projected onto the clothing of the child to really give them the POV of the character."
These projects seem to be well thought out considering the constraints.
The first is for a simple projection mapping on an object.
The second is for a wearable system that communicates with projector some how to trigger different displays.
"The last is for a animation that gives the viewer two different perspectives, I think this would be interesting but might be complicated."
I would help this artist to consider the time involved in animating because they would be making two animations which is going to eat up some time especially if they want to work in 3D.
I would also hope they had some ideas on what the character looked like or the environment they character would be in because I would want to get started on the animations as soon as possible.
"The student I believe did give a sincere and to the point answer with their ideas, the student also clearly proposed three things."
The first idea that the student spoke of was mapping animations on to objects and using the object's shape as a way of increasing the visual effects of the animations.
The second idea was mapping and tracking clothing on individuals and using it for artistic purposes.
The last idea was creating a projection that allows the user to step inside the object being projected on and view the shots from the characters point of view.
With these three ideas I believe that me and this student could work on some cool mapping project that uses the artistic aspects the student spoke of in the third idea to make a really cool visual experience for the viewers.
Idea number one doesn't seem like much of an idea.
It seems like this student is saying they would just spend the week brainstorming.
Ideas 2 & 3 both have to do with getting clean water to those around the world who need it most.
"They also seem like the same idea, just in different words."
"I honestly don't feel like I know enough about the type of thing being proposed, so I have no idea how I would contribute."
Although I do think 2 & 3 are worthy of the time and effort.
The student said he/she will prepare enough before doing a project.
Finding a way to clean water.
Like to clean the rain water.
To build prototypes about collect water from the atmosphere.
The ideas are great.
The steps of making a one-week project are organized.
But they are too general so I can't develop more ideas base on that.
"The student put in effort into their ideas but I think more details are needed, as well as possible tools/skills that would be required."
"In idea 2, I love the idea, but how would you incorporate the solar energy part with this clean water process?"
"In idea 3, I think more information is needed as to what materials/tools/skills would possibly be required for a group of students to create possible prototypes."
"Reiteration of ideas:
Idea 1 - Creation of the outline, draft, visual presentation, write up, and materials required for a possible project."
"Idea 2 - Provide clean water to people, and also an air transport system to collect rain water, purify it, and then distribute it, by using solar energy."
Idea 3 - Create prototypes of idea 2 and distribute it with biodegradable containers.
Your ideas reminded me of the LifeStraw (http://www.buylifestraw.com/).
This technology allows people around the world to filter contaminated water and allow it to be instantly drinkable through a straw.
"I think in a semester or two, a group of students could take a LifeStraw, and build on it even more somehow."
"Maybe use the same technology to where, instead of drinking from a straw, make a fast and easy way to clean and store this water instead for later usage."
I very much enjoy the idea of the rain water collecting building.
We take for granted of the water supply we get in America even though some part of the country is hurting from trouts and lack of water.
For an idea that gather rain water for usage is a pretty good idea.
The facility can be build in an area that is rich with rain during certain time of the year like Florida or Washington.
If you can collect the water then filter and a way to distribute it it would be really helpful.
I would definitely partner up on this project since it is about a subject that is very important in life and for society to have clean running water is very important.
Yes this student made a sincere effort to explain their ideas.
One of their projects was about scanning magic cards and projecting some type of holographic image.
The other was to make a portfolio of all the work they have completed and also a short animation film.
"This student has some great ideas, especially the studio idea."
I would use my skills in web-development and programming to help out in any way I could to get a studio going.
Idea 1 is to make a stop motion video using action figures.
Idea 2 is create an interface that would allow magic cards to become 3D mapped on to the field.
Idea 3 is create a portfolio of all the artwork and projects they have created.
"I really like the Magic idea, at the moment the streams of Magic Invitationals are rather boring but adding in the spectacle of the 3D rendering could really ramp up the entertainment."
Three things were pretty clearly proposed.
"The stop-motion idea is intriguing, as is the holograph-magic card idea (even if it's a little derivative of the yugi-oh anime)."
And the portfolio development sounds like a really awesome idea.
"I'd love to collaborate on any of these projects, Doing concept sketches of possible characters for the magic cards, or helping to sculpt creatures for the stop-motion animation sound awesome."
spending a semester working with other artists and collaborating on creating our individual portfolios and having that input from other artists sounds so beneficial.
This person made a sincere effort and proposed three ideas.
The first was to create a stop motion film.
The second was to create an interface that scans and 3D prints magic cards.
The third was to generate a personal portfolio.
I like the idea of creating an interface that would create 3D prints of magic cards.
"Ever since I was little when I use to collect pokemon cards and yugioh cards, I always thought it would be amazing if they had something that I could scan my cards with and that would put them into a game or something."
To this day they don't really have anything like that as far as for card games.
I know they have Skylanders which sort of does the same thing but for action figures.
This entry suggests a website that builds on the great commercial success of JK Rowling's series of books and movies.
The interaction by the reader with the capability of creating their pathway is enticing for people.
There is a lot of excess verbiage; it sounds like an ad for Pottermore.
"Your description needs to show more objectiveness, like someone just talking about it not someone excitedly looking forward to it."
This entry is direct and to the point meeting the need of immediate satisfaction that this world now craves.
It meets the challenge by explaining the site in a clear fashion without emotion yet allows the excitement of the fan  world to glimpse through the basic unemotional descriptions.
Is Pottermore a game or does it interact with the books?
"In your description, it almost sounds like a game based on  a book, and I am not sure that fits the criteria."
Interesting choice of future book.
The strengths of your entry are in the wide variety of uses for blogs as well as examples for them.
"You have done a lot of research, and it shows."
"The blog meets the challenge of future book by being a never ending, ever-evolving work of text contributed to by many."
You have a lot of examples in your entry.
"If you remove those and just show a variety of blogs types, styles and topics and maybe a blog 101 that would work better."
Wow!
Those are quite the concepts for reading in the future.
You have listed a variety and their uses today and in the time to come.
I do not think the history of writing or the technology based readers is needed nor are the steps technology has made in computers.
They make no difference to the system you are discussing.
I think if you keep your description to factual based reporting of the systems it will work better in the guide.
There is a lot of information there.
Reddit appears to be an ever expanding source of information.
If this is so then it meets the challenge like the blog.
I wonder if Reddit has everything like you state.
How is the information validated?
Are there actual books there or is it just blogs and just used for information look up?
Your guide is slightly confusing to me if you could clarify I would appreciate it.
"Anything Star Wars is an automatic win in my book, and I'm all for retro feels."
"The physical description of the book and its contents is clear, and taking the reader through the steps of how the images change is helpful to understand what makes this book special."
"Describing the lenticular printing process earlier in the summary might be helpful to the reader, allowing us to get a better mental image of what is being described without resorting Google to get a quick and dirty definition."
Fantastic description of the capabilities and (likely endless) possibilities of tumblr.
Thorough representation of how you feel tumblr is changing the face of books/lit related media and the features available to bloggers.
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of image you use for this post.
"Perhaps adding a link to the different types of posts you described (photo-centric, media, text, etc) to give the reader the chance to see how the site works would be helpful?"
"Excellent description of the features, functionality, and purpose of Pottermore website."
"I had heard of it before, but always considered it to be a stagnant wiki for the Potter 'verse."
It was enlightening to know that Rowling continues to participate.
I think your description of how this is part of the future of books was laid out well using this specific example.
"Repetition of ""lore"" in the summary."
Consider using synonyms in the other places this word was used?
"Extra word in first sentence of section 3: ""While Pottermore is limited to <b>to</b> Harry Potter""."
"Awkward phrasing: ""or eventual silver screen""."
Consider revising wording and encasing this section in parenthetical?
Excellent fact backup and mini-history of audio-blogging/podcasting.
"Section 3 is well thought out and highlights the pitfalls of a physical printing process, while underscoring the viability of podcasts as a literary medium."
"Bonus points for the use of ""bourgeois""."
Consider adding html links to research citations and the 99% Invisible podcast.
"This line confused me: ""Pew Research reports that in the past 30 years the levels of individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."""
What are these people not doing?
Consider revising wording to make this reference clear.
Completed assignment on time.
I encountered several run-on sentences throughout the assignment.
This made it difficult to follow the author's arguments.
Consider revising and parsing arguments out into a more centralized format.
"Additionally, incorrect word usage (""is becoming more patience"", ""provides the reader to"", ""as oppose to a book"", etc) made it extremely difficult to assimilate the author's meaning."
What a great example!
I had no idea what to write about in my description and think that you chose the perfect media.
You've provided a ton of information in your 300 word allotted space.
"There definitely isn't much ""fluff""- you get down to business from the start."
"I wish I had a better grasp of what this technology is, as I then think that this would be an extremely informative explanation."
Your knowledgable of this type of media is apparent in your description and I learned something new by reading your assignment.
You seem confident in your prediction of the future of the book and readers of your assignment cannot deny the contagiousness of your excitement.
"Having no idea what an ""augmented reality reading experience"" is, your summary only confused me!"
Maybe somehow include in that initial summary that this product's purpose is to deliver a 3D reading and viewing experience.
"That is the point of this technology, correct?"
"Also, the following sentence is confusing:  ""At this time, it is an iPhone or iPad but there is an Android version under development."""
"I ran into many of these ""for instances"" and kept having to reread sections of your assignment."
It was choppy to me and a hard read.
"There are numerous run on sentences and a plethora of facts but not enough explanation.Perhaps my best advice to you, as someone who has never heard of such a technology, is to reread your assignment and pretend you're in my shoes."
Good luck!
Your summary is great - straightforward and provides the necessary information to understand your idea of the future of books.
You chose a very interesting subject matter and I'm excited to check out www.postsecret.com in my free time.
Your 300 word description is extremely clear and easy to follow.
The time that you spent working on this assignment is apparent.
"You gave a great description of the book itself and allowed your readers to have a grasp of your personal experience with the book and how it changed the way you 

My favorite line of your description is the following:  ""The book is colorful and dark, emotional and boring, fantastic and dull."""
"I love the following line as well:  ""What makes this book a “future” book is that it doesn’t have a single author."
"It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight than an actual book."""
"I wouldn't have linked this book with the ever-popular social media world, but your point is great and so true."
"Overall, I don't think that your assignment needs much revising."
You did a great job with the rough draft and looks more like a final draft to me than a rough draft!
I look forward to reading and critiquing your future assignments for this course!
The only thing I can say could use a bit of revising would be that you kept repeating that this book is a compilation of many different people's thoughts.
I felt while reading your assignment that you may have repeated this so many times in different ways to fill space and hit the required word counts.
"If this is true, it's unfortunate because you did a great job on this assignment."
I'd omit some of these repetitive phrases in your final draft.
"I also noticed the misspelling of a word in the following sentence:  ""What makes this book a “future” book is that it doesn’t have a single author."
"It is more like an interactive blog or news feed on an internet social media sight ([SITE]<--change to this spelling) that an actual book."""
You gave a great summary of the work that you chose to be the future of books.
Your quick snippet of a description is clear and purposeful.
Your readers have a great grasp on what they are about to read in your description.
"I love that you included a link in your description and have every intention on visiting the website in my free time to learn more about ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag""."
My favorite sentences of your assignment were the following:  “'Click-Clack the Rattlebag” is a book in name only.
"Its text is entirely invisible, you see: invisible like ghosts."
"And thus, aesthetically, “Click-Clack” is a work of art presented entirely in vocal narrative."""
"As a reader, you definitely got me interested in the media that you chose to explore and the eerie ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag""."
I disagree with you that the future of books will be audiobooks!
"That's besides the point though and a personal opinion, not a literary critique."
"In all, I think that you completed this assignment in a purposeful, meaningful manner."
Perhaps the only critique I have is that maybe you could explain why audiobooks haven't already taken off (it's a media that's been around for quite some time) and expand on the idea of why now is the audiobook's perfect opportunity for a comeback.
Wow!
I absolutely love that you included a picture with your summary.
It made your assignment come alive and was obviously the first thing that I noticed when I clicked on the title of your work.
"Not only did you include a picture, but it's a very interesting picture!"
"Just by reading your summary, I got super curious as to what experiencing ""touch"" would be like on pottermore.com."
I didn't know such a website existed about the Harry Potter series but am not surprised!
I only read a couple of the Harry Potter books (I've never been much into fiction) but am curious and excited to explore the website.
It's great that you included the link within your writing.
"Your excitement of this media is apparent in your writing, and definitely string along your readers to read through your whole assignment."
"I love how you mentioned that the pottermore.com crashed during it's initial release, that you insist that this website is just ""that cool."""
"I love that you realized the following:  ""While it is not a replacement for the tome-like books, it brings a flair that is impossible to experience with paper alone."""
(My assignment is based on this idea as well.)
"I think my favorite line of your assignment was the following:  ""If this website could be neatly bound, pressed, and fitted with a dust jacket, it might be the most perfect book of the future."""
"You realize that even though the website is super cool, there is still a need for tangible bound books."
I agree!
"UNFORTUNATELY, I don't think that your assignment needs much revision."
"You did an excellent job of ""doing it right the first time"" and it is obvious that your sentences are thoughtful and calculated."
"If anything, maybe include the pottermore.com link in your summary?"
Great work.
"I'm looking forward to reading and ""critiquing"" your future assignments for this class!"
"I had a hard time finding the strengths of your assignment, as I don't think that you followed the assignment prompt."
"After reading and rereading your writing, I'm not clear as to what you think the future book will look like."
"I understand that you've done some family history research and plan on passing it down to your children and your children's children via digital photography and writing, though I have no idea about what you think the future of books will be."
"Please see my constructive criticism below, as I think that your rough draft needs some major rewriting."
Your summary isn't very clear.
"My first suggestion would be to rewrite this portion of the assignment and be straightforward, not leaving anything to be guessed or assumed."
"The purpose of a summary is to tell the reader exactly what they are about to read, not to leave them wondering what your subject matter is and what they're about to get involved with."
"Of the five assignments I've read, yours needs the most amount of revision in my opinion."
"I'm not exactly sure how to approach your writing, as I kind of think the whole thing needs to be rewritten."
"The assignment was to decide on what the future of the book will be and give a 300 word explanation of it, followed by why you think that society is leaning in the direction of your chosen mode of literary media."
"To me, your assignment just seems to tell of how you've done some research on your family history."
"Perhaps you should read through the assignment prompt again, as I think that you may have been confused as to what we were supposed to write about."
"Maybe I'm so wrong and I've completed the assignment incorrectly, but mine follows the same guidelines as the other four I've just critiqued."
"I hope you don't find my response as rude, would just rather tell it to you straight as you have an opportunity to fix your assignment before you turn in the final draft - that's a good thing!"
"The entry specifically points to the book's uniqueness, in that it is not necessarily just an e-book or a website; it is her brand."
This meets the assignment's challenge by being both specific and creative by finding a book that is very atypical.
"The description falls short, not just in word count, but in its aim to make me want to go out and read this book immediately."
"Vegan or not, the book should make me want to see what makes it different, how it can be a ""future"" book."
"I think with a little more explanation, this description could stand out more."
Figure out exactly what makes Emily special to the vegan cookbook world.
How is she innovative?
"If it's not just a cookbook, explain why."
The future factor explanation is very well done.
"I definitely want to find something like this, as I'm sure most people who enjoy faster processing would."
"By appealing to the demand of the people, this entry meets the challenge, though it does not offer a way for people to actually find such a book."
"This entry did not find a specific book, but instead wrote about a hypothetical one."
"The main challenge is to think of books creatively, but this does not pinpoint something that I can actually go out and see for myself."
"I would suggest trying to find a hybrid-type book, or at least something that could become hybrid very easily."
"This is highly imaginative and definitely something that would be a fun, interactive experience for any reader."
"It meets the challenge by turning a book into a video game, something that is surely being worked on by the creators of e-books and web-books."
"By not giving a real example of such a book, this entry is not completed."
"While the exact book the author speaks of may not yet exist, an example should still be found, per the assignment."
The author should find something that is similar so that I can at least see what they're talking about a little more clearly.
Using a PostSecret book is a great choice.
"It is compiled of thousands of people's work, making it a unique, collaborative project (that, somehow, still keeps its secrets)."
"The explanation of the future factor is spot on: it is a blog in a book, and surely a medium that will evolve into something great."
"Perhaps in the future factor section, the author could make a solid case for why exactly I should go out and buy it."
"While obviously I'm interested, what specifically makes this book extra appealing, and why?"
"The book promoted truly does break down barriers of storytelling, as the author states."
"It is a wonderful example of the future book, and giving many examples of its strengths makes the entry very convincing."
"Additionally, the author's telling is both engaging and compelling."
"Perhaps add more written examples in the middle section, creating an overall convincing entry."
"I really like how you pointed out, in the beginning of your explanation, that you do not think books will ever die."
"I think this is important because, it keeps in mind that yes, although documentary film is becoming an extremely popular way for information to be transferred, it is not going to replace the traditional method of exchanging information."
"It also allows for books to remain special and sacred, and to stay an outlet for those who want to ‘disappear’ into their own world."
"This being said, you make an excellent point in stating that film is very relatable as it is easy to SEE another individual, and thus experience aspects of their lives with them."
I also think you did a very good job explaining the film and in explaining the intrigue and the value in its genre as a documentary.
"The only thing I think may have been too bold of a statement was when you said that ""film will always be more powerful than text""."
"I do think that this is a rather subjective statement, as many individuals absolutely become enchanted by and involved in a story when it is on page, because so much is left up to their own imagination."
"The voice and image of a character, the tone or the character's overall mood, the atmosphere of a building or of a place - and the beauty of written text, at least in fictional stories, is that my perception of a character will never match another's; yet, in a film, a character appears in a very straightforward way, with very little interpretation to the viewer."
"I think it very much depends on the genre, for one to say that film is more powerful than text."
"Of course, if a demonstration or learning technique needs to be taught, I can definitely see how film is the way to go."
"But as for me, I have always been more comfortable with text, as it is easy for me to segment, control, and become enveloped in a story."
"I guess my critique would be to clarify WHEN film is more powerful than text (as you did) instead of making a general statement that film is ALWAYS better, as many people may not feel this is true."
"But, other then this, I literally thought that what you wrote was perfect, and I think you posed wonderful points and thoughts - great job!"
I agree with you that sites such as tumblr are growing to be exponentially popular.
"In addition to liking and reblogging photos, users can reblog and critique or praise an individual's work, which includes but is not limited to: art,photography, music, poetry, and short stories."
"Because there is potential for re-blogging content, if an individual posts exceptional work, their work is likely to become extremely popular on the site, which can be a very good thing for the original poster."
"I think that many people who use tumblr use the site for the exact purpose of discovering and connecting to other people's posts, opinions, and self-created work."
"The problem I see with tumblr is that there is no citation, and it is very easy to 'steal' one's work."
"In the tumblr guidelines, it explicitly states that all content you post is liable to be viewed and re-used by other people."
"This means someone can re-blog a story or poem you write, and totally trash it, or even edit it themselves."
"While this is wrong and most individuals wouldn't do this, there is nothing in the tumblr guidelines stating that this is wrong, and tumblr staff cannot be held responsible for if an OP is not given credit for a 'stolen' picture or post."
"In the future, do you think that there could be an add-on to tumblr that instates a rule or a policy that enables an original poster to always receive credit for their work?"
"If books are moving to be completely online, would not this be necessary on a site like tumblr, if an author wanted to maintain their credibility and their autonomy as the original writer of a work?"
"Also, another problem I see is that, while there is SO MUCH creativity possible on tumblr, there is not really a place for those who want to become involved in a story to go."
"If I wanted to read an entire, thousand page book, or even a book series, I would not go on tumblr to do it."
It just isn't possible to read so much information on a post.
"In addition, an author cannot make any profit, or gain any credit other than recognition from writing a book - so if tumblr were to be the future of books, there would be no way for a writer to make a living."
"Do you think that, in the future, it would be again possible to add on to the site a place for writers of long novels / book series?"
"In this add-on, could it be included that one would have to purchase the author's work before being able to view it and reblog it?"
"This way they are still following the 'tumblr way' and re-blogging work, but they are also honoring an author's time and energy, and cannot simply view it / re-blog without giving at least some form of tribute."
"This would also make it a lot less possible for someone to 'edit' or 'remove' the OP's part in the post, and it would also still allow for a re-blogger to leave commentary - just, the work wouldn't be free, as books are not free."
Just a thought!
I think the idea of tumblr being the future of books is genius!
I think you did an excellent job of building up this book.
"You made the book seem very intriguing, exciting, and above all, futuristic."
"I have no idea how you managed to include pictures, but the pictures certainly did an amazing job of enhancing the work and proving your overall point."
"Through viewing the photos alone, and without reading any of your text, I got the feel that this book is incredibly different than other 'traditional' books, and in this I think you absolutely met the challenge of this assignment."
"I think that, in your final draft, your photos will do an outstanding job at proving your point."
"In addition to this, your writing was well-thought out, properly organized, and succeeded in dynamically building up the book you chose."
Great work!
"I honestly do not believe you need to embellish upon your original draft before it is finalized; your work was clear, concise, and to the point, as well as implanting an interest and an intrigue in not only the work you described, but also in a genre of books that follows the style of your chosen work."
"I wouldn't change anything to this draft, so good job!"
"I do agree that websites such as Reddit are not only very popular now, but will also continue to be popular in the future."
"People want a way to interact with one another, and also want to find individuals who share certain interests."
"As you said, it is not just text that is used on Reddit, but also pictures."
"In addition, people can also bring in other information to help others out or to just share interesting experiences, and I think that people of today’s generations and in future generations really enjoy that autonomy in writing and reading."
"The only issue I see with your future book idea is that, unless actual books / stories are uploaded by Reddit users, one can’t really become involved / pulled in to a fictional world or fantasy land."
"For many, books are a means of escape, and many book readers want to become involved in the lives of the characters, want to understand them and relate to them, fight for them or fight against them; also, many individuals who read also like the idea of an alternate world existing."
"For instance, I believe that this is why so many series, like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, or The Lord of the Rings, were so huge – because there was another universe that readers could disappear into."
I’m not saying that there is no possibility for things like this to exist on Reddit – but your post didn’t really give the feeling that users post stories full of characters or alternate worlds.
"I think that, if you were to include that in the future, entire books and stories will be uploaded onto Reddit, that this is the way books may be read in the future."
"For instance, if you said something akin to the following,  “instead of authors publishing books through  a publishing company, maybe they will publish their novels through websites such as Reddit, as so many individuals use this website”, it would give the sense that books in general are moving in the direction of being completely online through such websites."
I believe that this description of the Role-Playing book was sufficient in answering the prompt questions.
"In addition, the OP made the Role Playing book seem exciting, challenging, and subjective to one's decisions and preferences, which many individuals will most certainly enjoy."
"The book is also not limited, it seems, to a physical, hand-held book, and can also be read and 'played' on e-devices, making it accessible from many different locations and in many different ways."
"The reader will be in control of the outcome of the ending, which can be a delightful experience for many individuals who prefer this type of book."
I believe that the author should make sure to be more clear about the fact that you can use this book in more ways than just reading through pages.
"Although e-devices were mentioned, I was still confused as to whether or not this type of book would be hand-held, on an e-device, or both."
How will the book be accessed on an e-device - from a website?
"Will it be purchased and downloaded instantaneously, or ordered?"
Will it have any software that must be installed onto an e-device?
"While the author said that this book would be available for e-devices, I feel it should be more explicitly stated that it can fluctuate between being an experience through page or through screen, both, or neither, because I am still unsure as to whether this book can be read in the way a traditional book is read, or if that is not the case at all."
"Other than this, this genre of future books sounds exciting!"
"The article is well-written and accurately describes the subject matter and how it can be seen in the future of the book, particularly in the realm of fan-author interactions."
"For the most part, the article is solid, even if the ""Description"" section is a bit short."
My only criticism is that the article seems to only give vague examples as the girth of interactive activities that are available on Pottermore.
"For example, fan fiction--it's described as a hub for it, what does Pottermore offer that other fanfiction hosting websites do not?"
"How is fanfiction integrated with other areas of the website mentioned, if there is any at all?"
"Also, because Pottermore is an online entity, perhaps it would be helpful to include links?"
"The links are very helpful for anyone who isn't immediately familiar with the app, and the Future Factor of the material is stated very clearly."
"While the links are certainly very helpful, the ""Description"" segment of the article seems to rely on them too much instead of making its own unique statement about what the app is and why the audience should be interested."
The article is very well written and gives the reader a good understanding of the nature of the Pottermore website.
"Adding the detail about the site crashing on launch is also a great way to show that it's not just the author who feels positive about this sort of continuation of printed works in the digital realm, as is comparing it to other popular social media."
The image provided doesn't seem to reflect the interactive nature of the website.
"Perhaps a screenshot of one of the activities described in the ""Description"" would be better?"
"The author does an excellent job of both describing the material, making it sound almost irresistible to readers, and explaining why this book exemplifies how technology will shape the future of the book."
Providing the link to the material in question is also quite nice.
"It's a bit nitpicky, but ""I have selected"" is hardly necessary here."
It would far more effectively to cut that out and stick with the basic summary of the work.
"The article is very well-rounded and addresses many valid points about blogs and how they reflect the changing nature of writing online, publishing online, and the closer interactions between reader and writer."
"Describing a specific blog, rather than just describing the medium in general, would probably be a better way of showcasing the nature of the blog."
"However, if the author chooses to continue with simply talking about blogs in general, linking to specific blogs and blogging platforms would be a good way to showcase the diversity mentioned here, rather than just assuring the audience that it exists."
"""Annarasumanara"" is a Korean variation on the many Japanese web-based, comic-book style stories that grew out of the Manga and Anime and comics of a few decades ago and that have now become rendered as graphically enhanced software that can be displayed on computer screens."
"The strength of this entry is that it does demonstrate an important aspect of the continuing evolution of books by showing us an example of one segment of the ""reading pool"" that is now making the transition from print to digital format."
"This is a reasonable example of the direction in which future books are heading, but as the author continues to develop the field guide, it may be interesting for the reader if some of the history of the comic book, particularly as it developed in Japan (Manga, Anime) and Korea (Manhwa) is provided, as well as some thoughts on where all of this may be going as we proceed through this century and beyond."
"For example, it would seem that this style of reading entertainment -- especially popular to young adults -- is well suited for eventual transformation into 3-D renderings, perhaps even holographic, at some point in the future."
"In addition, some reference and relevance to our course readings (if possible) would make for a stronger case in point."
This is quite an interesting interpretation of the intent of this assignment.
"Using DNA testing as a way to build a historical thread that can possibly reveal long-lost relatives from the past, or perhaps uncover historical facts about people that might help to strengthen filial bonds (or not!)"
certainly identifies an application of a current technology (genetic and genome analysis) that can be used in a very positive way.
"And the translation of the data collected into electronic formats will make it more likely that information converted from printed and pictorial media will be stored in a centralized place, with a reasonably high chance surviving for a very long time."
"You seem to be agreeing, then, that the eventual transformation of knowledge and information, including books, from the printed formats of today to more digitized forms is not only occurring, but will continue to happen until one day nearly all of our reading interactions will take place through a human-machine, electronic interface."
One area in which this entry may fall short (as is the case with my own entry) is that a specific work is not identified.
It may be helpful if an example of something like this could be found and then used as a supporting basis for the remainder of the field guide.
"The implication that the technology of the book and of information in general is moving toward digital is, I think, a valid one, but I for one would like to learn a little more about the specific portions of DNA components that allow us to be able to track historical genetic data and what this technology could afford us in 50 or 100 years."
"Also, it's always a good idea (as I'm sure you know) if our academic writing can be supported by relevant citations that support our statements and speculations."
"As your entry thus far is merely a rough first cut (for all of us), this is probably already in your plans as you work toward a final version!"
"This is a very good example of a current technology that is moving us closer to a time when written information is created, edited, refined, developed, critiqued, and stored in an Internet-based, 'cloud-like' environment."
In a direction divergent from social-networking websites such as Facebook -- and as the author of this entry has explained -- Tumblr demonstrates one of the ways in which our book and information technology is changing from one based on printed materials to one based in a digital universe.
Human interactions here are and will rely on man-machine interfaces that may eventually eliminate the need for printed copies of nearly everything.
This example also welcomes wild speculation about the way humans will be exchanging information in the future!
"Since a good example has been found that demonstrates a current trend in the timeline of 'book technology' (past, present, and future), In working toward a final draft, the author should not forget to provide a back drop to Tumblr, perhaps by describing more about what lead to Yahoo's acquisition of this technology, provide some more details about Tumbler itself (images, descriptions), and to speculate on where this technology could be leading us and how it will impact the continuing evolution of the book."
"References to course readings would also be a plus, if applicable."
"Kali's selection of ""Night Film"" for her entry for the field guide is presented very well and the embedded images provide visuals that help the reader understand the unusual characteristics of this book."
"Although scores of other authors have incorporated illustrations, graphs, images, codes, and other visual devices to enhance the reader's experience in 'living' the story, the merging of information that provides the reader with links and other interfaces to the Internet, the importance this additional information has to the story lines and the need to download an external decoder, while possibly annoying to some readers, is in itself an example of how the current technology of the book  is using the wonders of the digital age in incorporating some of its interfaces as an integral part of the book."
Kali's obvious skill at presenting ideas and information -- as her adeptness in articulating opinions in our discussion posts has already been demonstrated -- will be an advantage as she further develops the idea she has proposed in this first draft of her field guide.
"Hopefully, she will also include some thoughts on how the techniques used by Pessl in ""Night Film"" will evolve as the technologies for interacting with data  and ideas (particularly 3-dimensional) progress to the point in which readers feel more like travelers through a parallel universe -- feeling the same sensations experienced by characters in the story -- than outsiders looking in."
"This is another good example of a book that uses current digital technology to enhance a reader's interactive experience (in this case, a children's book designed to be read on an iPad using iBooks as the e-reading application."
"Although printed books have provided an excellent medium to display vivid illustrations and bright colors for children, it is not until books began to be digitized and designed to be read on electronic reading devices that animations, voices, and movement -- all of which greatly enhance a child's interaction with a story -- that features such as the author has described are now possible."
"Selecting a children's book in demonstrating possible directions for the future of books provides ample room to speculate on what may be in the realm of possibility within the next decade and, indeed, within the next century."
"As mentioned in other critiques, and as this idea continues to be refined, some thought should be spent on the possibility of describing the history of book technology and in providing suggestions for where our digital reading technology is taking us."
"To be sure, printed books have been a critical factor in the advancement of mankind, but I think it would be nice to read more about some of the differences between what some of us may have experienced as children and what amazing options are for the children of today."
"Extend this into the future, and the possibilities become quite exciting indeed!"
It does show how things we did in the past are now improved or changed as a result of technological advances.
I clearly understand the point the author is making and the writing is clearly thought-out.
"The field guide attempts to show the ability that technology has to instantly document our lives and save that documentation forever, without fear of it being lost due to some physical destruction."
The problem is we spend most of the field guide learning about the authors time his/her brother uploaded their DNA online in order to map back potential members of their gene pool.
"While this is interesting it seems to fall short of the assigned task of finding a (a real book, object, publication, real or virtual thing), not something made up."
The field guide closely follows the prompt and finds a new type of way to engage with books through some sort of future or new technology.
The guide explains the process of emerging existing texts into a more immersive reality and has made me want to download the app on mu iPhone.
"In the future factor section, the field guide slips away from the pragmatic approach taken in the description and delves into an area of more idealizing than explaining this thing in the desired technical manner."
"Kudos for using futuristic implementations into the field guide, like the hyperlink to News from Gardenia's Unbound site and the picture."
The Field Guide does well to sell its audience on News from Gardenia which is a book about the possibility of a utopian future.
"The author of the guide accurately and with concise but important detail, gives an accurate description of the thing they are writing on."
"Though Unbound, the crowdsourcing platform for book publishing is really the futuristic aspect of the guide we only hear about it once we get to the last section."
Instead of describing News from Gardenia so thoroughly we should be getting a description of how Unbound will change the future of text.
The field guide describes Reddit very well and points out all the aspects of Reddit that make it something that answers the prompt's questions.
The field guide creates even for someone who knows nothing about Reddit a well thought out description enabling them to use the site.
"While the Field Guide explains Reddit very well and enables the user of the guide to navigate the site with ease, its claims that Reddit is the future of books is a bit short sighted."
"While Reddit may be the future of DIY, self-help and information/resource based books, it will have a hard time treading in the rivers of fiction."
Fiction is a huge aspect of books and text still and the Reddit community and the way the site is constructed would struggle in attempting to improve the fiction universe.
The selected thing from which the Field Guide is created follows the prompt perfectly.
The description in the field guide explains what has changed in the books adaptation and these changes are a result in new technologies and advancements made.
I would really think of new ways in which ebooks can change like the way the one described in the field guide did.
Instead of assuming that mainly a transition from paper to electronic format is all that will happen.
Fill your future factor section with more of what you think is a possibility of the ebook.
The technologies described definitely seem to provide a more immersive experience for the reader.
"Especially ""Alice,"" with its ability to provide a previously unheard of level of interactivity with the story itself."
The selections point toward an emerging technology meant to work with the existing book itself to make it something new.
"It meets the challenges of the assignment by detailing how these products enhance the reading experience in a variety of ways (social, interactive, and reviews)."
"It also hints toward how these technologies might be expanded upon in the future, to further change the reading experience."
The only place I can see that it falls short is that this entry is not actually about a book or something intended to replace a book.
It is about a set of applications that essentially act as peripherals to a book.
Similar to the way that video game system accessories add capability to the existing system.
It would also have been nice to have a some information about the platforms on which these applications are currently available.
"This entry very effectively describes the ergodic text, ""House of Leaves,"" and how it utilizes unorthodox methods of story-telling to give voice to several characters."
The features detailed make the prospect of reading a text of such innovative design very enticing.
It is representative of how certain authors are now bushing the limitations of the traditional book to tell stories in a way few could have previously imagined.
I do not believe this entry falls short.
It effectively achieves its goal of describing this ergodic text and what books could look like in the future.
"I do, however, disagree that this text and those like it show the way forward for the book."
"I believe they are quite powerful as a novelty, as I believe printed books will become in the future."
"However, I don't believe they will go further than that and become an industry standard."
It would be much more difficult for new authors overall to consistently produce multilayered content as a standard format.
It would also get laborious for the reader and the format would no longer be unique.
Ergodic literature can range from multilayered storytelling to works of art that use words as their medium.
"In order to remain as impressive as they are, they rely partially on the fact that the are so different from the traditional book."
"Additionally, while texts like these seem as though they would have to be produced as a physical book, that is not necessarily true either."
"A good example would be ""S."", by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, as it is an ergodic text that is also available as an ebook and an audiobook."
"This sounds like an amazing companion to one of the, if not the, most popular book series' in history."
The Harry Potter series enjoyed immense popularity before it ever graced a movie screen.
There are few modern series' that have managed to hold the public attention in such large numbers for seven books and eight film adaptations.
I can only imagine how immersive and how much fun this site would be for a Harry Potter fan.
I think this description really gives the reader a sense of the level of content on the site.
As well as several examples of the interesting and creative content they can expect to find when they visit it.
"For an fan, after reading that description, I can only imagine that their next stop would be Pottermore.com."
It is not made clear in the description if this resource can be used by someone reading the book for added effect to their reading experience or if it is simply intended that more condensed and interactive ebooks/websites will eventually replace books.
"I do not agree with the comment about ""the perfect book for the Twitter generation""."
Such books and short versions of full-length texts already exist.
An old example would be the novelization of the death of Superman and his eventual return.
"Roger Stern was tasked with novelizing the most popular comic book story arc in the history of the medium, titled ""The Death and Life of Superman""."
"It was so popular that DC Comics produced a more condensed novelization for younger readers, titled ""Superman: Doomsday and Beyond"" by Louise Simonson."
"Generally, readers go to books for a greater depth of information and storytelling, which they find immersive."
It is usually film adaptations that go the more condensed route.
"I don't se how such an innovation could actually replace the modern book, until they provide the same level of information and storytelling, as well a similar practicality of use."
Fair warning: This is my second review about this site.
"I feel this description did a very good job of highlighting the social features of the site and the additional literary content, in the form of fan fiction and the small additions from Rowling, which would definitely be a draw for any die hard Harry Potter fan."
Combined with the continual development of additional story content in the games and the ability to stay in contact with J.K. Rowling herself.
It definitely appears that Pottermore.com would be the number one place to go to immerse one's self in the Harry Potter universe.
"There is no clear connection to the idea that this is an evolution of the book, or something bound to replace the book."
It is a website.
"A very in-depth site with many features, but it is still not a place where on can go and read the seven official Harry Potter texts or an innovation that delivers those stories in another way but in the same depth."
"It is a great resource for fans, but it is still reliant on the existence of the books, in basically their traditional form, one which to build this universe."
I believe you've made a strong point here about the similarity between documentary and informational text.
There is a natural connection in the way that the information is delivered.
Video in a how-to or documentary style may very well replace their textbook or informational text counterparts in the future.
This is one of the few types of books I believe is on the way out.
"I think the author of this entry effectively argued their point I do not have any criticism, other than that the ""future factor"" section was definitely over 150 characters."
This entry goes in depth to explore how podcasts offer the same experience of reading a book but with the added benefit of being able to multi-task.
"It effectively explains what a podcast is, who uses them, and why they are important."
It also uses several very specific examples to strengthen its assertions.
The only suggestion I would have is to make mention of the millions of different types of podcasts are out there.
There is truly a podcast for everybody.
This would give readers a reason to seek out podcasts.
"I know a lot of people who are intimidated by them just because they don't understand what they are, or that there are podcasts out there that cater to their interests."
"This is an extremely well-written entry, with enough excellent description to make anybody want to read (or here, listen to) this story."
"It highlights a very relevant piece, one which blends the custom of stories with the ""second orality"" we are focusing on."
"The writer of this entry appeals to ""the illiterate and the bibliobibuli alike,"" stating the advantages of such a form of literature in the modern world."
A great entry!
"I've read and reread this entry trying to find something to suggest an improvement on, and I can't find it."
This is a great entry and I think it accomplished everything it was meant to.
This is a very interesting take on the future of the book -- the focus on an interactive future is exciting.
I think this entry presents an excellent argument for the futuristic digitalization of literature.
It effectively describes the benefits of such technology and why it is an important option for our literary future.
"I think this entry could spend a little less time describing less relevant things (i.e., the first paragraph of the second section) and focus instead on simply and succinctly describing some of the features of Ideo."
"It would be interesting to have a quick summary of the features offered by the Nelson, Coupland, and Alice concepts."
This would allow for further exploration of the specific benefits of each feature as they relate to different potential readers.
"This entry wonderfully blends the arts of printed books and digital media, must like the subject itself."
"It is clear that the writer supports the idea of digital media as an enhancer of printed text, rather than a complete replacement, which is something I completely relate to."
"This entry effectively describes the content of the story without being over-revealing, and it describes the ways in which the story is a glimpse into the future of literature."
I think this entry does a great job of answering each of the questions and meeting the requirements of the assignment.
I am absolutely inspired as a reader to experience this work for myself.
"I think this entry very effectively describes what makes ""Annarasumanara"" different from other e-texts, and therefore a ""future"" book rather than one we already know."
The author picks out a specific characteristic of this web comic (the noticeably different format and disregard to the uniformity consistent with other web comics) to distinguish it from others and propose it as a futuristic text.
"It also gives readers an idea of what the web comic is about, and makes us curious to know more about the characters and story line."
"The only suggestion I might have is to focus a bit more on what makes this story special and different from anything we've ever read before, rather than on being so descriptive about the characters or parts of the story."
"I definitely do want to hear a little about the story line, but feel there is a little bit too much of it here."
"I want to learn about the characters' reasons for doing things by reading the web comic itself, rather than from a summary."
"But overall I think this entry makes an excellent case for ""Annarasumanara"" as a futuristic book!"
Great choice of film!
"I love the documentary Babies, and I think you hit upon its main unique strength here in a very eloquent way."
"Rather than use text at all to communicate its message, it relies specifically on non-verbal cues and images throughout the film."
"I really like how you mention that if you glance away for a moment, you can miss a part of the story, as that is very true for that film and for so many social cues which are non-verbal."
"I think this brings up all sorts of great questions, because if this film is a sort of future book it seems more a type of oral culture than literary culture."
"Indeed, it would seem that almost all documentary films are, in a way, more a throwback to an oral culture than literary culture."
I think you've hit on an interesting idea here.
"Some quick grammar edits I noticed:
Film is powerful, and ""showing"" something to a learner is much more relatable that ""explaining"" something to a learner."
-- that needs to be than.
Babies cry when their hungry or uncomfortable and are not capable of fending for themselves.
--their needs to be they are or they're.
"""Film will always be more powerful than text."""
"This is a huge statement, and I don't think this one film or field guide backs up this statement."
"Your paragraph after this begins to argue that watching something on a page would be somehow better than reading words on a page, but you don't explain why."
"Probably I got bristled by this just because I'm a huge reader--for me, text will always be more powerful than film."
"But I think it might be easier to stick to this specific film, and say why this film is more powerful as a movie than it would be in book form."
"It is so much easier to prove a smaller point than a larger one, and the length limits for this assignment were so limited the space is really restricted to make a larger point."
"Also, I love your idea of a future book, in the third part, but the instructions read to describe what makes this specific item a future book."
"So again, I would maybe draw back to the movie Babies and talk a bit more about what the future factor of this film is."
"I think you could even move the last paragraph of your summary down to that third part, and get into a bit more of the movie's documentary aspect in the middle part, an exploration of the documentary as 'book' in the middle section."
"Oh, also I believe you need a pic!"
Somewhere in there.
"There were so many amazing shots in that film, I'm sure you can find a great screenshot online."
"Or, I'm not sure if this is possible with html but I believe it is, I bet you could link the trailer here from Youtube and use that as your pic?"
That might give readers the best idea of the film.
"Wow, this is definitely a double-future dose."
"Literally future-esque, as in its subject matter, and then the figuratively future-esque of the assignment, with the Unbound Publishing."
"I'm a big reader and I hadn't heard of Unbound, so very cool!"
"I love your description of the book, as you point out right away what makes the subject matter of the book unique--the isn't the same old dystopian novel, but a utopian novel where we aren't all subject to the same old gloom and doom."
"You point out the book's effects, that it has the ability to inspire people to make a better world, which I think is also important to make people want to run out and grab it."
"They know what its about, but what is it going to make them feel?"
"So in several ways, you've found a very unique book."
I also appreciate that you are concise.
"In English classes I think we tend towards fancy language without saying a lot, and I think you use direct language here which conveys your message with the clarity the assignment wanted, something I know I had a hard time doing myself."
"Some quick grammar fixes I noticed:
""two hundred years in the future to a world that is recognizable yet alien""--I don't think this is grammatically wrong, I'm not sure, but I feel like ""two hundred years into a future world that is recognizable yet alien"" might read a bit smoother?"
"Totally up to you, of course, but I just wanted to throw it out there."
"""Truly a novel that inspires the reader to at least acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is possible."""
"--This sentence doesn't have a subject, I think it might make more sense to say ""Lllewellyn has written a novel that truly inspires the reader to acknowledge that sustainability and human equality is, at the very least, possible,"" or something like that."
That authors name has so many L's!
"I don't have too much other constructive feedback, I think your choice of novel and why it is a future book is so right on."
"I guess maybe your title could be a little more powerful, but that is me straining for some more feedback to give you, to be honest."
"I think you have room to add some more descriptors in there, which might hook the reader in a bit more and pull them down into your assignment--your summary is so intriguing, but your title doesn't match that."
"Maybe: ""News from Gardenia by Robert Llewellyn is a utopian science fiction novel created, in part, by its readers."""
"Also, I'm not sure the sentence where you say you feel disloyal saying it isn't from the future is very clear."
"The whole wording of this part has to be sort of awkward as we're talking about a ""future"" book, and so it is awkward to figure out how to take about that, but you are saying it is from the future, right?"
"So maybe ""This is from the future because"" because you aren't saying it isn't from the future?"
Does that make sense?
"I love your concept of the role playing book, and I do agree that this is already happen to an extent."
"I think it would help if you gave a specific book that this is already happening with, as I believe this was the assignment."
So here is where I know this is happening.
"James Frey's new book, I believe it is called EndGame, will include a mystery with hidden gold (?)"
"I think and an app produced by Google, so people can solve the mystery, plan on the app, and solve the game."
"Here is a link: http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/comic-con-james-frey-introduce-719685

Google Niantic labs makes Ingress, an interactive real world game which people have written many books about, where you are battling in the real world for I think access to power points or something?"
"I think you need to pick a single specific book or other media source in existence today (game, choose your own adventure book) and describe that."
I'm sure there is something out there that fits your description.
"You mention Phantasy Star in your summary, so if you choose to focus on that, I think your title should explain Phantasy Star, your description should explain Phantasy Star, etc."
I gave examples of the Role Playing Book above that I could think of off the top of my head but the book that has always reminded me of a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel is Italo Calvino's If on a winter's nite a traveler... so you may also want to check that one out?
"You don't choose your own path in it, but you, as the reader, are written into the book."
"Also, I think you could compare Choose Your Own Adventure Novels to hyperlinks on the internet."
"Really, when we browse the internet, we are choosing our own adventure with each click."
"Instead of flipping to a different page in the book, we are moving to a different web page online."
"But until you focus on a single item, I don't think this assignment is done correctly."
"Some of the other concepts presented are awesome and future-esque, but this is by far the most intensely future-esque concept presented!"
Very cool.
"I'm surprised I haven't heard about this more, as it sounds so revelatory."
"I think each of these concepts sounds so complicated, it might be easier to focus on just Alice at it was the one that caught your attention."
"I was so interested in this that I looked it up online, and it looks like you took some of your info and text ""The team looked at how digital and analog books currently are being read, shared and collected, as well as at trends, business models and consumer behavior within related fields."""
straight from their website?
Bummer.
"It is important not to do this, as you will for sure get in trouble for it."
"If you have any other cut/copied text in there, get it out of there because Prof. Finn said he would run this through plagiarism software and it will catch this."
"What you want to try to do is read the web page, think about the information and process it, but say it in a completely different way."
"Or if you still want to say it in exactly that way, you need to attribute it to the web page."
"I think this is a lot to write about, as it sounds sort of overwhelming and complicated as three different book-related technologies."
"To me, it would be more digestible to just approach it from Alice, since you said that was the more interesting one."
"That way, there may be less pressure to summarize so much of what the company is doing, and it might be easier to just explain the technology of Alice itself?"
"Wow, the technologies I've critiqued thus far are crazy."
"I had no idea the ""future"" of the book was so advanced!"
"This is a great choice of technology to feature, as it is obviously right on the pulse of the future."
"I like how you mention the possibilities with children quite a bit, as I think that is important, I know many children who already use iPads as reading tools and I can definitely see this as a possibility in the future."
"You also managed to explain everything in an eloquent way, there weren't any grammar errors in your writing that I could find, so great job on that as you are talking about some complicated tech topics here."
"I think what I'm missing here, from the title down, is a clear and brief description of what augmented reality is or how it works."
Are there glasses?
What makes it different than how I use my iPhone or iPad now?
The pictures become 3D when I look at my iPad?
I point my iPad at a picture?
"Where is the picture, what do I point at the iPad, my eyes or the picture?"
"I guess for the non-techie, that aspect lost me."
"Just a slower, more clear description of the process of reading in this augmented reality."
"I pick up my iPad, and then what happens?"
"Is there text on the screen, or only pictures?"
What are QR codes?
"I would leave that part out, and focus on explaining the process of reading this sort of book like you're talking to someone who only reads hardback novels, and has no idea about the tech world."
Just walk them through the experience.
I'm a fan of making things really simple.
"And for some reason your title shows up as ""Untitled 341,"" but then you have a subtitle?"
"So I'm not sure what happened there, if that was a glitch in the system or something."
The entry strengths are good because it explains how The secret lives of Men and Women can attract to people who want rather read from  the internet.
"It challenges the assignment because it provides reasoning on why this would be the future book, such as how people adapt to social media and how this future book can relate to it."
"I think that the entry fell short on providing more reasoning as to why it will be a future book, and I would suggest to explain more about it."
The entry strengths are the detail explanation about the book.
It meets the challenge of the assignment because it discuss and explains how this book can be a future book.
"I think that the entry falls short in the reader not understanding the reason this book can be the future book, It give the reader many explanation about but not very well convincing."
I think that it needs to be more convincing as to why this can be a future cook.
The reader gets a full understanding of what is being describe to be the future book.
It meets the challenge of the assignment because it is explained and gives a good knowledge about why the role playing game and choose your own adventure game can be the future book.
I think that this entry had good supporting information as to why it can be a future book.
I think that the reader was convinced and maybe provide more information in proving the point of why it is the future book.
I really think this post was good because it provided the book information in details and that it was an ebook.
It met the challenge of the assignment because their was enough information to convince the reader about the future book and why it could be.
I think that the entry did not fall short and that its was well written with enough information for the reader to be convince.
"The only feedback would be about the font, It was not the regular font which is New Times Roman, that should be changed."
The strengths can be found in that there was a lot of good detail information to why the digital book is the future.
It met the challenge of the assignment in proving reasons as to how the digital books will be the future books due to modern technology.
I think that the entry did not fall short and the reader was convinced that the digital books and society adapting to modern technology will enhance the demand to want digital books.
I think maybe explain his question at the end.
The author certainly supports that podcasts are a way forward for creative works.
There are a number of outside sources within the Field Guide that support the idea that podcasts and recorded audio work in general could surpass the written word as a way to consume both fiction and non-fiction.
"First of all, there are certainly some typographical errors that are easily corrected, such as ""individuals over the age of 18 who do not has doubled."""
"I assume that is meant to read ""over the age of 18 who do not READ has doubled""."
I believe that this field guide would also benefit from more focus.
"Rather than focus on the technology of podcasts or audioblogging, I would like to see how a specific podcast functions and demonstrates the way forward."
"The author does mention one work, ""99% Invisible"", but it is given as an example of the form rather than being the focus of the field guide."
"This follows in the ""Future Factor"" portion of the response."
"Rather than focus on how the podcast points the way to the future of books, the author instead digresses on an unrelated tangent."
"While it's certainly interesting information, thoughts on book distribution, government censorship, etc."
don't seem to have a place in this particular assignment.
I believe the primary changes that need to be made are in organization.
"Focus on a single work, demonstrate how the form is superior (or at least the way forward) and finally why this constitutes the future of the book."
The author does an excellent job in summarizing the appeal of the novel itself.
"In addition, the way the book is created, with crowdsourced financing and increased interaction between audience and author, is a compelling way forward for future publications."
"I may be wrong in this assessment, but I believe that the ""description"" aspect of the assignment was to be less focused on the content of the novel and more on what makes the novel different from other novels."
"As the author notes, the content itself isn't unique in that sense."
"I would suggest refocusing the ""description"" on the process of the publication, rather than the content."
"That way, it would clear-up plenty of space in the ""Future Factor"" section to discuss how this process shows us a way forward in the future of the book."
"The author does an excellent job at describing the uniqueness of the work itself, as well as the visual style of the art."
The ability to alter or eliminate the restrictions of the printed page is well-explained in how the work takes advantage of the lack of limitation in electronic form.
"I'm not certain the author adequately explains the benefits of the ""lack of borders""."
"There is mention that ""the visual style of this story goes hand in hand with its format"" but not having read the work I'm not sure what this means, aesthetically."
"Likewise, ""it takes the act of reading a story and makes it almost into a film strip"" does not indicate why this is necessarily a positive development, or one that can be expanded to other works."
"There is also some confusion that seems contradictory, such as ""some hosting sites have shrunk the pages down to a more ""normal"" size"", suggesting a traditional page layout, yet the author also says, ""it simply could not have been published in the old media""."
A few lines clarifying this apparent contradiction would be helpful.
"Overall, a focus on the effect of this borderless approach with this book, as well as ideas on how it could be beneficial in the future would be helpful."
This field guide entry does an excellent job in explaining Tumblr and how it can be used by authors and artists to distribute their craft.
"It also demonstrates how this can be effective in a changing electronic landscape, incorporating both multiple forms of media and reader-response into an ongoing product."
"In this case, the author focuses on a technology, rather than a specific work."
"I believe that to properly fulfill the assignment, the guide should be refocused on a particular work that uses Tumblr as the medium, and use examples from that work to demonstrate how Tumblr is different from other mediums."
"While one author is mentioned as an example, the field guide would be stronger if it were focused on the work, rather than the technology."
The author does an excellent job focusing on a single work and expanding on the method that work uses in order to demonstrate how this can be used for a variety of works.
"Each aspect of the expanded website is well-explained and clear, and it's easy to see how this is a useful tool to expand the world of the novel."
I have very few criticisms of this work.
"Perhaps it would be beneficial to distinguish between these sorts of websites and an ""ordinary"" website dedicated to a particular piece of fiction."
"For example, would the myriad of fan-made websites be considered a part of this expansion of the book, or would it be limited to author-run websites?"
I love the way you portrayed the ongoing relationship a blog can establish between author and reader in the “Future Factor” section and how it differs from that of a novel.
"You did a great job in your description as well, and made a compelling case as to why a blog can be considered a “future book.”"
My only critiques are grammatical ones.
"In your summary you said “people can subscribe to as many different ones to follow and read each entry.” You have a strong voice throughout your entry, however this sentence feels awkward and could be rearranged so I it feels more cohesive with the rest of the entry."
"Then, in your description, when you said “to skydive out of a plain,” plain should be plane."
That’s all I got :) great job!
You did an excellent job with this assignment.
Your descriptions were very clear and you made a compelling case as to why Pottermore is a “future book.” I had never heard of it and you made me want to go check it out myself.
You have a great tone to your writing that made your entry enjoyable to read.
"I love your last line and the idea of technology as a tool to “feed” the fans, great imagery (and very accurate I believe)."
Fans are always hungry for more and are constantly searching for new ways to feed that hunger.
"Technology offers a great way for fans to connect with the author, as well as other people who have the same interests."
My only critique is a grammatical one.
"In the description when you said “A animated and interactive telling of the books,” a should be an."
That’s it :) great job!
I loved your entry!
It was thoughtful and very creative.
You have a great tone that makes your writing enjoyable to read.
"I loved the way you described the aesthetics of the book, invisible like a ghost."
I also liked that you included Gaiman’s Halloween gift-giving tradition.
That history gives the work more solidity.
You did a great job in your description and made me want to go download it immediately.
"You also made a compelling case as to why this is a “Future Book.” 
Bibliobibuli  is a great word by the way, I actually had to look that one up :)"
Um...well...I really don't have much.
"What can I say, you did a great job."
I guess you could give us a quick line describing what the story is about.
I think that could make your description stronger.
This was a great entry.
Your description was excellent and by far your greatest strength in this assignment.
It was very detailed and I could clearly imagine the book in my head.
"Your description was excellent, but I feel that your argument as to why this should be considered a “future book” was lacking."
To me it felt as if you were defending it against modern technology instead of embracing it as part of our future and where books are going.
I think if you removed these sentences it might help alleviate that defensive stance: “Scanimation books are impossible to recreate in digital format.
"If one was to do so, it would entirely devalue the retro novelty and simply exist as crude animation, like an animated gif."""
"Also, in your description, when you said “11 Iconic Scenes from a Galax Far, Far Away…” Galax should be Galaxy."
This was certainly the most creative idea I've read.
The idea that we are all stories is one that I firmly believe.
It's a great concept.
"I like the way you portrayed all the footprints we are creating through photographs, videos, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc."
Our great grandchildren will have a far more accurate account of our story than we have of our own great grandparents.
What I also like about this concept is that our stories never really end.
Our story is part of our parents' story and our friends' stories and many other stories that are constantly overlapping and weaving together throughout the years.
Your summary is very unclear.
Even in your description I wasn't entirely sure where you were headed.
"I didn't fully understand what your entry was about until I read the ""Future Factor"" section."
"Creating a clear summary and immediately describing what this ""Future Book"" actually is will strengthen your whole assignment tremendously."
"This entry provides a detailed account of the author's ""future"" book."
"I thought the field draft was well written, however in terms of the book's future factor I would like to know more about why other books would follow suit."
"It is clearly stated what makes the book different now, but what makes it special enough to be the future for other books?"
"This entry was very interesting, particularly for those who are interested in science fiction novels."
The description of the book's synopsis is what makes it really captivating.
The student started their description with a question bringing the reader in as if we were reading the back cover of the book.
It was a very good entry with very little I can find wrong.
The future factor is well described and I feel I have a grasp on what Unbound is all about.
"Additionally, the student explained why this way of writing publishing could be popular in the future."
The student also gave us a taste of what his/her full field entry will look like with a clear and well lit picture.
"I suppose if I wanted to see anything more, it would be more about the history/inspiration of the book."
This entry is actually very realistic and makes a convincing argument for the popularity of orality over reading with examples of existing podcasts and other media today.
"Similarly, although the future factor contains a lot of hypotheses there seems to be enough realism to make it believable such the expense of printing and digital."
I feel the student's entry for future factor could do without the first three sentences.
The student could easily use more examples of how the podcast is increasingly popular and what advances it is already making as well as why it will be more popular later.
The students gives a wonderfully detailed description of his/her future book.
The format was thoroughly explained enough for me to understand what I would be getting into without the student actually giving away the story.
"The student also made a great point in their future factor about how creative format books such as ""House of Leaves"" would not be able to be e-books or digitized."
When reading the future factor I would like to know more about why this type of format is a natural progression.
Would certain people not find it tedious?
"It is true that it may be a richer experience for those who are willing to try, but in all honesty how many people are willing to work and read?"
We live in an age where easy access and fun at your fingertips is most popular.
So what makes this book accessible and how will other books follow?
The student has provided sufficient background for his/her future book as well as a convincing and believable argument as to why the format for such a book will become even more popular.
Perhaps the student could explain why it would be a good idea for Emily C. to have her work only accessible online.
"The student has done a great job explaining why it was savvy for Emil C. to use her online resources, but why not also publish in print?"
What about people who are still reading physical books and struggle with the digital age?
How will authors like Emily C. ease the people drifting behind into the future of e-books and online videos?
"The part about ""Alice"" met the challenge of the Assignment."
I liked the idea of being in Hogwarts and walking around and looking at notes!
Maybe the author could set these scenarios up in such a way that the curious are rewarded.
I think the references to Nelson and Coupland were unnecessary.
I think Alice covered all your bases on this assignment.
A very spirited campaign for the blog!
I could see how reading a blog could approximate the book-reading experience for you.
But will the blog replace the book?
"I see them co-existing as they do presently, but unless blogs progress in some way, I am not seeing the ""future book"" part."
Description was strong.
Many good points and examples.
I listen to podcasts often while working myself.
Future factor was weak.
Reference to Konstantinou seemed only tangentially related.
You seems do be saying podcasts are the future because publishing might be shut down...?
"Are you saying in the future, there will be no blogs?"
"If there is no internet, how are the podcasts disseminated?"
"I'm sorry, I was confused by this."
"Future Factor was strong, but it did not match Summary and Description."
Future Factor section had a great idea for future book format and good points about how fast technology is moving.
Is the answer documentary films or a book with digital capabilities?
You answered the assignment with two different forms.
I would say stick with the latter and re-write #1 & #2.
This was a great example of a story in a new-ish format.
It made me interested in seeing and reading the comic!
Not sure how this is the future if it is now...?
"Also, can it be read on a phone or is size sometimes still a consideration for this format?"
I think the subject of the field guide was well chosen.
This is an interesting competitor in a very new and exciting space.
You did a great job of conveying the sense of newness and excitement for the 3 different programs.
I agree that interacting with books in the future could be heading in this direction.
The persepective in section 2 confused me a little bit.
It was almost more like a sales pitch or business case from the IDEO company than a field guide entry.
I think the field guide entry should contain observations from an outside observer.
I would remove the sense that the author has some sort of insight into the IDEO company motives for creating the programs and provide a more in-depth description of how the interface between the programs works.
Section 3 could also use more objectivity.
It reads like one who is partial to this particular program.
This entry highlights a very recent innovation.
The case for this being futuristic is easy to make.
I don't think it is a stretch to anticipate an increase in supporting content for novels.
I agree that we will very likely see more of this type of interactive website in the future.
My only criticism of this is that I would like the focus to be aimed more closely at the actual books hosted on Pottermore.
The focus of the assignment should be specifically what constitutes the future of the book.
The format of the books on Pottermore may be the way of the future.
"Maybe someday all books will be hosted on a centralized website, like libraries of the future, with interactive material being an expected requirement."
This entry provides a strong sense of what is means to be a future-ready book.
"I agree with the sentiment that readers in the future will want increased speed, technology, and convenience."
"The ebook or hybrid book definitely fits the speed, technology, and convenient requirement nicely."
This entry falls short in providing an actual example.
Describing all ebooks is too generic for a field guide.
I would pick one and explain why the ebook is the future of books through the description of a particular example.
I love the connection to video games.
"Video games are growing in such a huge way that it would be easy to conceive of a distant future where movies, TV, and even literature take inspiration from them."
This is a very fun and futuristic vision.
This entry falls short in providing an actual example of this particular hybrid ebook.
I think a field guide should focus on one example and describe the execution in detail.
Excellent future factor!
I have a few friends that hate reading and have switched exclusively to audio books(where possible).
I have yet to listen to one but it is clear that this type of format is already catching on.
Your particular entry sounds like an improvement on the traditional audio book.
Good job.
I loved this entry.
"It is hard to come up with comments here; however, if I was to try to make an argument for the future factor of audio books I would cite the increase in handheld smart phone devices, blue tooth car interfaces, and other technological advancements which make audio books easier to consume."
I would be very surprised if there wasn't readily available data regarding a correlation between increase in tablets and audio book popularity.
"This entry focused on the Ideo, a really innovative technology."
"This entry delves into the specifics of Ideo, and the different concepts that they have developed."
"It is well-written, and a thoughtful post."
It meets the challenges of the assignment by examining such an innovative concept.
"This entry could focus a little bit more on the history of the book, and how e-readers fall into the development of the book."
"Furthermore, the author could touch on the ways in which people interact with e-readers today."
I really enjoyed this entry's selection for the assignment.
It was innovative and interesting.
The author takes a unique perspective by examining the children's book.
"As children thrive on constant stimulation, electronic devices are great for kids."
The description section could be a little bit longer.
"After reading it, I was still wanted to know more."
"I would also discuss the history of children's book, and how they have progressed briefly that way there is a comparison with the future."
This entry does an excellent job at incorporating images and text.
"The author clearly thought about this assignment, and the work is very well-written."
"The author selected an unique text, and successfully described the book's elements."
"This entry could delve into the history of the book, and how this is represents the future of the book."
"The assignment called for what happens in 1000 to 5000 years, so perhaps a more complete picture of what makes this ""futuristic"" is necessary."
This entry's strength lie in the last section.
"The production of the book is what makes it futuristic, and it is a coincident that the book also happens to be about the future."
"The author was also able to include an image, which makes the post stronger."
The description section was written very creatively and sounded like something you would read off the back of the book.
The summary of the book could be a little more specific.
What formats are you talking about?
"The description section, while it is well-written, seems out of place for this assignment."
"The only futuristic thing about this book seems to be the plot line, until it is explained that it is a crowdsourced book."
"The author could speak a lot more to the futuristic elements of that, as oppose to a summary of the book."
This entry's strength is in thinking outside of the box.
"I would have never examined a Post Secret book in a futuristic manner, but I understand the logic behind it after reading this entry."
This author has a detailed explanation of postsecret.com that aides in understanding the concept.
"Overall, it is well-written."
This entry could do more to find the futuristic nature of the book.
"Specifically, the line, ""This additional element of art makes the book futuristic as well,"" doesn't really make sense because art has been incorporated in books for thousands of years."
What/how will we be living that makes this book so applicable to the future?
This entry clearly defines the Pottermore website and its attributes as an extension of the Rowling series of books.
It definitely could be viewed as a futuristic technological leap for books especially this type of story that has an epic quality too it and multiple books contained within a single story line.
There are quite a few editing errors that need to be made throughout the draft.
A close reading should catch them.
"Otherwise, this site sounds like an interesting website for those interested in the Harry Potter series."
The author clearly describes the book in great detail as far as its physical look and appearance and gives a good comparison helping the audience understand somewhat what scanimation is.
There are some minor editing errors that should be seen on a slow re-reading of the entry.
"Additionally, I was a little bit confused on the concept of scanimation."
The author of the entry gives a comparison but I find myself still struggling to see the futuristic qualities of the book.
The book sounds like it fits the bill to a futuristic book but also just sounds like a picture a book.
Perhaps a little more explanation of scanimation would explain the book better.
I love how the author of the entry describes all the parts of the book that make it futuristic.
It sounds like the book using the internet in a major way to tell the story and this integration of literature and internet technology definitely speaks to a the future direction of books.
"It sounds like a great read, I'll have to check out."
The author of this entry perhaps goes to far in re-telling the entire plot of the book.
The entry is incredibly long and quite possibly far over the 500 word limit.
A tighter description of the futuristic qualities of the book and a lot less plot telling would make the entry more successful as a field study guide.
Right now it reads more like a book report.
"This entry does a great job of capturing the futuristic essence of ""The House of Leaves."""
There is great descriptions and focus on the formatting of the text in the story.
This appears to be the greatest example of the book's author's forward and futuristic thinking.
"This too, sounds like a great read."
There really isn't much to critique in the negative of this entry.
This entry does really great at explaining hybrid books and how they are a potential future book type.
"However, this wasn't the assignment."
There isn't a clearly chosen book that is being described just an idea of a book type/genre.
This entry doesn't describe an actual book.
It merely covers the idea of what a successful future book would look like.
The assignment was to find a book that speaks towards the future and describe it's merits as a future book.
This entry doesn't do this at all.
The strength in this entry is definitely the hard fact that this concept and company are brand new to most of us reading the entry.
The description and use of persuasive language in the description was exceptional.
It made me want to watch the video for a second time.
This meets the challenge of the assignment because it is simply an actual attempt at a company predicting the trajectory of where the future of the book will be.
The problem that had me questioning whether it would work as an entry was the fact that two of the three products were things that surrounded and enhanced the use of a book or ebook.
I might focus on the last company(?)
that actually altered the way we would read books.
"The strength in this entry is the third section which explains the ""future factor""."
"While the actual product might not interest me completely, the explanation as to how it represents how we as readers can interact with a story in different ways made me want to check this story out to at least experience the different mediums."
"This entry meets the challenge of the assignment because it provides us with an actual product that is being used by authors and readers today, but is only a glimpse into what is possible in this new technology."
The formatting is a little bit confusing.
I could not tell if there were parts that were quotes from the actual links provided.
"The strength of this entry is the very fact that instead of going with a digital future book, the writer found an example of what a future physical book might look like."
"This meets the challenge of the assignment because while at first glance of this book we might not look at it as the future, the writer explains to us how the formatting is what make s this a prime example of how the future book might evolve."
There are a few grammatical errors in the entry that caused me to have to reread the sentence.
The strength of this entry is the writers passion for reddit.
"The writer seems very invested in this particular website, and states very vehemently that this site is already replacing books."
The entry meets the challenge because it is one of the specified examples in the assignment description.
This entry falls short in two ways.
First is a summary and description.
I was confused for almost all the post as to what reddit is.
"Even once I followed the link, I was unsure as to what exactly its function is."
There needs to be a more concise explanation as to what it is.
The second way is in its contempt of the book.
There are people who will more than likely be offended by how callously the author has decided to write of the importance of books.
"Maybe by explaining why they think reddit will replace physical books and bookstores, the reader will have better insight as to why the thought is replacement versus  growing alongside them."
This entry's strength is it's description of the technology.
"While this is the second entry to describe a technology that interacts with books in the form of an app, it explains the technology in a way that I am able to picture in my mind."
This meets the challenge of the assignment because it introduces the readers to a new way to interact with printed books.
This entry falls a bit short in the summary section.
I think it might be the grammar in the first sentence that throws me a bit off as to what the actual product is.
This is better described in the second section and there is a moment where the concept is clarified in my mind as a reader.
The strengths are definitely the added images.
