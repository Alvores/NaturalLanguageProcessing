I found these deficiencies -
1) There is no test plan
2)  There are no mock ups
3) The points under the Requirements heading do not actually describe the requirements, they mention the 'flow' . 
For example, in the Requirements heading the author has written the following - 
""1.The user should login as an instructor.
2.The instructor should create an assignment by checking allow self-review option.""

1 & 2 are pre-existing functionalities, and are not requirements. Infact, 1 & 2 are steps or part of the flow of a use case.

Please change the heading name for better clarity.

4) The 'Files to be modified' section is at the bottom. It should be moved up, and ideally transformed into a block diagram so that any viewer can quickly see whats to be modified in the existing Expertiza application.",,,-1,"About the visual aids, I think the author did a good job of it, he add some very helpful tables and diagrams, for example, in the database design part and application design part, the author added some useful diagrams, even the working flow, I think it;s very useful for reader learning about what you need do and why you wanna do that.",,,-1,"Everything related to problem statement, design and future implementation has been mentioned properly, just that test plan is missing from the wiki page.",,,-1,use case and application flow diagrams helps to understand the flow the things they are going to proceed ,,,-1,"Test plan is missing completely.

In the sense, they can specify exactly what are the current issues and what they intend to do. Also, the project design is just two sentences.

However, this wiki fails to provide a testing plan. 
Therefore, I suggest that you add a testing plan next time. ",,,1,"The detailed description  is included in the design document, But I have a few suggestions:
The problem definition is too short, please provide more detail about that. And the data base is fully implemented.

New design does not look complement. 
I guess design explained in this doc is enough to solve this problem.",,,-1,All functionality is included in the document. everything is captured,,,-1,Seems fine. Nothing to point out. Simple implementation of a formula to calculate the composite score is required. Good topic to work on! The team has put efforts into the design document. ,,,-1,"Yes, all the functionality as part of the google doc has been incorporated into the documentation. However, the test plan is missing which is an important part of their project. They could also specify their tasks in detail.",,,-1,the design doc shows the flow diagram of how the things would be approached.,,,-1,The document does not explain what features would be added to what controllers; it only mentions what is to be modified. So I could not determine if the methods are added to a wrong class and/or any kind of impact new code would make to the existing code.,,,-1,Datadesign and user flow diagram shows that author has complete idea about what they are doing. Also they are following DRY principle to avoid code duplication.,,,1,"The author is trying to mix self review and peer review into 1 module. I would probably try to separate it out. Going back to 'peer review only' should involve as less steps as possible.
",,,-1,Design doesn't seem to have any gaps.,,,1,"According to the document, this assignment requires 3 main functionality to be done:
1. It should be possible to see self-review scores juxtaposed with peer-review scores. 
2. Then implement a way to combine self-review and peer-review scores to derive a composite score.
3. The author(s) should be required to submit their self-evaluation(s) before seeing the results of their peer evaluations.

According to chapter ""Requirements"", only the first functionality is clearly stated, but it is not clear whether the other two are covered.

In the ""Application Flow"" chapter the 3rd functionality has been implemented in the ""Pre conditions"".

In the ""Method to calculate the composite score"" chapter the wiki finally mentioned the 2nd functionality.

In fact, all the functionalities are covered, but they are not well organized, which make it not clear about what functionalities are designed.

Therefore, I suggest that you should modify the content in your ""Requirements"" chapter, to explicitly mention the other 2 requirements.",,,-1,The design talks in detail about the changes and database design. The design patterns being used are also mentioned. The required changes are also included in the design and the plan looks proper that would not cause issues as most changes are being done in already existing code.,,,1,"Most of design are shown in this wiki and fully implemented, which is good. But I hope if they can provide possible file that would be better.",,,-1,"At the current version, I didn't  find problems.",,,-1,neat table of calculation is present that is very helpful to understand the requirements,,,-1,the design incorporates all of the functionality required. ,,,-1,"I don't think they need to add any methods to any class as this is just an algorithmic design to the problem, In no way would they cause any merge conflicts with the original branch, More focus on design should be there.",,,-1,The description covers the big picture and then moves on to explain the smaller details which makes the description easy to follow.,,,-1,The classes chosen seem apt for the placement of methods.The designs are simple and easy to understand.,,,-1,"Team has explained this project nicely. They have mentioned all the files that need to be changed and in what way those changes they are planning to do.
",,,1,"This wiki provides only the design of functionality, no design of code is provided, so it's impossible to evaluate the quality of the logic design.
I suggest that you should add code design for each problem.",,,-1,"There is no problem in the design proposed, which is detailed and everything looks good.",,,-1,"1) the methods are well designed.
2) the design is simple and easy to understand.
",,,1,"The changes that the author needs to make is shown by a table to calculate the composite scores based on the self review scores and peer review scores. The calculations seem legitimate. However, if mistakes are made by the reviewers (given wrong rating), it will indirectly reduce the composite score. This could be handled by using the ""mode"" i.e., the most common rating found in all peer reviews rather than taking the average of the ratings in peer reviews. I might be wrong, but that is what I think would be the best and it would be appreciated if you give it a thought and try with all the permutations and combinations.",,,-1,"Explanation looks adequate. 
However, I found 2 issues - 
1) The files to be changed could be mapped out to a block diagram for better comprehension.
2) The document does not mention what functionality has to be added to what source file. Only the sources to be changed have been listed. ",,,-1,"Changes are very good, the author has proposed Design patterns they will be used in the implementation, along with that method to calculate score has been explained elaborately",,,-1,This is perfectly explained. Each scenario and edge cases are written well.,,,-1,"The design doc provides a comprehensive explanation of the high level design and the requirements, ",,,-1,"The explanation of planned changes looks proper.

The use of diagrams makes it even easier to follow the explanations.",,,-1,"I think the explanation of current changes are good, it clearly and easy to understand. It's mostly about the design of database, but I think this project also needs some code implementation, I think the author should add this part, and give a good explanations.",,,-1,explained in detail. therefore easy to the document. ,,,-1,I find the explanation of the problem lacking in accuracy and detail. They haven't discusses their plan of action and how they want to implement their changes. The logic has been discusses well using the table.,,,-1,Author has shown a valid approach .It seems a good way to start the project.,,,1,"This wiki gives clear design of the requirement, and also provides multiple diagrams to support the description.

However, the wiki fails to provide explanations on why they designed it this way.
I suggest that you should give an explanation for each design.",,,-1,The explanation and description are fully implemented,,,-1,the quality is very high. they have a detailed explanation of the changes.,,,1,"This wiki employs two diagrams and one table to illustrate the functionality design, which helps a lot for the reader to get the idea. 

There is a little problem with current visual aids: no picture of the page is provided in this wiki to illustrate the effect of the design. 
I suggest that you should also include some snapshots of the page to enrich your wiki.",,,-1,"The design flow look good, but they did not provide us enough detailed information. Try to use UML diagram.",,,-1,they do have a visual aid. it can help the reader understand this project. ,,,-1,"The authors explain well what Mutation Testing is, it would be better if they give more description about their project scope.",,,-1,The Initial steps and Subsequent steps mentions all the project functionality requirements.,,,-1,The changes proposed are replaced the existing mutation strategy with the newly added mutation strategies. The proposed mutation strategies still lacks exhaustive explanation for newbie to follow.,,,-1,The design pattern seems not sound for just displaying an UML.,,,-1,Two UML diagram helps viewer to digest the processing model.,,,-1,The author has not provided any UML diagrams.,,,1,"The design processing is clear, but visual aids is missing. It would be better to add some UML or User Case Analysis.",,,1,"All the important things like Project purpose, design, and its test plan have been thoroughly explained and documented. The project description includes ""At present the calibration functionality is limited"", which uses calibration, so it will be better to explain calibration first and then use it or explain calibration somewhere else. As calibration is used various times in the description, its explanation seems to be very important.",,,1,The author has accurately explained where the changes are needed by explicitly specifying the file name which shows they have identified the problem's main cause. But a bit more explanation along with the file specification where changes are to be made could have been more useful.,,,1,The Visual aids have properly been used but certain images showing the difference in current stage(including problem) and after images(once the proposed solution is implemented) could have been more useful as it makes it easy for the user to exactly identify what is the thing that needs to be changed and how does it appear on the view.,,,1,"The project purpose and design have been briefly explained, although some more information would have made it better like how will a user be assigned a role, whether he will be able to pick it up or some else will be assigning him that role or is it a first come first serve basis where a user who is able to select a role quite early gets the role as it is possible that he may not be the correct fit for the role, or the team members decide together and take on roles the but if this is the case there is no chance of being a conflict in the role of a team member by stating proper test plan which is yet to be added by the author.",,,-1,"There is a test plan provided in the wiki which covers manual as well as the automated testing part of the project. In the automated test cases part, the authors have provided how they aim to approach the test cases.",,,-1,The team has adequately explained the changes that are needed as part of this project. It is clear from the writeup that what the issue is and what are the changes they are planning to incorporate.,,,-1,I think more explanation to the changes to be made to the system is better.,,,1,"This wiki first gives clear definitions for the 3 problems:
1. Implementation to see self-review scores juxtaposed with peer-review scores. Design a way to show them in the regular View Scores page and the alternate (heat-map) view
2. Implementation of the methodology to combine self-review and peer-review scores to derive a composite score
3. Checking if the author has submitted the self-evaluation(s) before seeing the results of their peer evaluations(already implemented).

Then it uses an application flow and a use case diagram to describe the design of changes on the system. The wiki also provides descriptions for the diagrams. 
In this section, it is difficult for me to determine which problem this design is aimed for. It seems this section is about problem 1 and 3.

I suggest that you should explicitly indicate which problem this design is solving and how.

After that the wiki briefly introduced the database design. It is too simple to explain this change.

I suggest that you should explain why you designed it this way and how it helps in solving the current problem.

Finally in the ""Method to calculate the composite score"" chapter, the wiki provides a way to deal with the second problem. It clearly explains how the composite score is calculated, and also provides a table to support the explanation.

To sum up, all the problems are covered, but they are not well organized, which make it not clear about what functionalities are designed. 

Therefore, I suggest that you should arrange the design descriptions according to the problems described in the beginning.",,,1,"According to the assignment document, 3 main designs are made: 
1. It should be possible to see self-review scores juxtaposed with peer-review scores. 
2. Then implement a way to combine self-review and peer-review scores to derive a composite score. 
3. The author(s) should be required to submit their self-evaluation(s) before seeing the results of their peer evaluations. 

From the description and diagram provided in the wiki, I can see that the design is able to solve the problems stated in the first section. 
This wiki also provide the logic design on the score composition algorithm.

But the wiki doesn't talk about how they are gonna to implement it with code, so it's hard to tell whether it follows appropriate principles or using appropriate patterns. 

I suggest that you should provide your code design for each function design so as to show the principle or design patterns you used in your design. For example, you could use a class diagram to show the architecture of your code.",,,-1,The team has added strategy pattern to decide the change at runtime. Also the design allows for a little modifications to run a new variation of mutation test. ,,,-1,The design is clear and tackles the specific problem statement mentioned and the steps seem clear enough.,,,-1,The author has clearly written the problem statement and explained where ever necessary. And necessary figures and flow diagrams have been provided for further understanding. ,,,-1,Class diagram has been added where necessary and explained in detail. ,,,-1,There is no test plan as the project it self is about testing the existing test scripts.,,,-1,"In my opinion, the design they provided sounds reasonable. They mentioned the problem of the existing mutation testing, and next, they mentioned their solution of the problem with several code blocks, a graph of execution flow, and the design pattern they are going to use in the project, which is the strategy design pattern.",,,1,"Compared to the last submission, the completeness of the design doc is great: the write-up contains a short description, the introductions of several terminologies such as Servo, Rust, Web-platform-tests and Mutation Testing, detailed project description such as setup, steps, strategy, execution flow, design pattern and testing. However, there is something I felt they missed, for example, I still don't get what purpose is for this project. Maybe they should put more focuses on the purpose of the project, such as why they need to do this mutation testing? Is it for the performance or for finding bugs? Maybe they should mention about what they can acquire from the mutation testing. That would be a great help for us to understand the goal of their project easily.",,,-1,"For their design pattern, they chose to use the strategy design pattern, which can help them reduce the redundant code when facing similar but still different situations. And their execution flow clearly shows us what situations their program will face during running and what decisions it can make to go through different results. Also, they offered code blocks to show us their solutions, which for me are simple enough to implement.",,,-1,"They offered the reviewers a clear execution flow graph, the UML design pattern to describe their strategy design pattern with relationships and functionalities inside. In addition, they also gave us some code blocks which include their implementation of the project. This also gave us another concrete view of the solution of their project.",,,-1,"The author just added some sentences from google doc.
I am giving some suggestions:
1. brief discussion of 2 lines what is the functionality, why the previous project was rejected, what changes you are needed to be done. ( project purpose)

Good job! But In your wiki, you write wrong line numbers for your refactor method, which should be 568 and 571, not 561 and 567.

Firstly, the method score is still very long, more than 50 lines. I think less than 25 lines is good. Secondly, the name of new method extracted from score method is not appropriate. For example, in line 203, a verb name ""get_score_max"" is better than a nouns name ""score_max"". Then, you did lots of creation in your spec file.

Is a Test Plan section appropriate for this project?  If so, consider speaking with your mentor about the best way to test, and include a section in your Wiki about it.

Also, I am not sure how much you guys are planning on tackling in terms of refactoring, but it may be helpful to specify which of your fixes apply to which pages  e.g., does you your proposed changes improve load times on expertiza.ncsu.edu/tree_display/list only?

The tasks have been properly mentioned and the modularity of the write-up is something that is commendable. Code snippets are too long in the write-up though.,,,1,"Yes, the write-up does mention how the authors performed the task. The plan of work explicitly states so.

Well done to the team.",,,-1,"This tam did a very good wiki write up. It explains every task they did clearly. Because they are TFD design project, so they explain what is TDD.

Good job! But In your wiki, you write wrong line numbers for your refactor method, which should be 568 and 571, not 561 and 567. What's more, I think the method is less readable after you refactor, because the output is not clear in self.export method. I suggest changing your line 568 code to ""csv = Assignment.export_not_nil(csv,@scores,parent_id,options)"", which is more clear to check what's is output.",,,1,"Most of the code is good. But there are still some things I think you can modify. Firstly, the method score is still very long, more than 50 lines. I think less than 25 lines is good. Secondly, the name of new method extracted from score method is not appropriate. For example, in line 203, a verb name ""get_score_max"" is better than a nouns name ""score_max"". Then, you did lots of creation in your spec file. I think using double and build is better in order to improve your efficiency of your code.",,,1,"Generally, you finished your work on time and systematically. Good job! But some issues are needed to be modified.
1. ""socre""method is very long, which should be refactored.
2. I think some method can be extracted from scores. For, example, from line164 to line 177 can be extracted to a new method called ""get_rounds_scores"".

They should add more content and explain how they are going to implement it.,,,1,I think that the team needs to expend more time on the design and write to-do steps after discussing with mentor so that their work is elaborated.,,,1,The team has used very few diagrams and that too of the badges which they are going to implement this semester. They need to add UML diagrams and a visualization of tables they will create as it becomes easy to follow. ,,,1,"The design doc includes the appropriate headings but fails to explain how they arrived at what changes they are making in tables and why they chose that design.

So I cannot comment on how far they have thought about the design.,,,-1,The design incorporates many things but they are just straight forward statements which only the team working can understand. A little bit explanation for each point is required.

@assignment_new_path, @course and @destination_path are not suggestive, because they are not used in the following  action or erb file, it's uncessary to make them instance variables.
I suggest that you should make them local variables.

In app/models/assignment.rb:
@assignments is not suggestive, because it is not used outside of this method, it is unnecessary to make it a instance variable.
I suggest that you should make it a local variable.

The update method in app/controllers/assignments_controller.rb is too lengthy.

In ""app/controllers/assignments_controller.rb"":

I suggest that you delete this line.

It is not DRY to use @assignment = Assignment.find(params[:id]) in different actions.
I suggest that you should define a new method set_assignment to set @assignment, then make this method a before_action for all the actions that need it. 

In line 127,  statement ""if !params[:course_id].nil?"" does not follow the Ruby Style Guide.

From the use cases, we can easily to understand what actions might occur between the presenter and reviewer, such as signing up, adding contributors, creating a submission, uploading paper, reviewing submission. For the database design, we can see how they designed the table for Paper class and the table for handling with many to many relationship between contributors and paper presenter. For the class diagram, we can see the relationship between User, Presenter and Paper class. As a result, the visual aids they offered are useful for me to understand the ideas.",,,-1,"Adequate visual aids, but I still expected screenshots.",,,-1,The link between user login/sign up to upload paper is missing.,,,-1,"I think for the use of visual aids, the author did a good job, for database design, they draw the different table to explain their plan and give the class diagram for explaining the relationship between 3 class: user, writer and paper. As a reader, I can easily understand the objective of author's job.",,,1,"This question is only based on the class diagram and the use case diagram. The use case diagram has been explained brilliantly. All use cases have been covered. The class diagram is also self-explanatory. However, they could have shown a diagram which indicates the flow of control.",,,-1,The best thing about this project document are visual aids provided by the authors. They have provided UML diagrams to demonstrate the working of the application.,,,-1,"Yes, there's a class diagram and a UML diagram in use cases which are very helpful to understand.",,,-1,All diagrams are easy to understand,,,1,UML diagram is descriptive.  Static html page could have been created for better aid.,,,-1,Visual aids are very good and make it easy t understand.,,,-1,"Yes, the authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the system. They have a separate section to list files to be created, and another separate section for files to be edited. After the above two sections, they have implementation section that talks about the changes to the flow of data in controller and view. It could not have been explained better.",,,-1,"On their wiki webpage, their write-up described the introduction for the background of Expertiza, the definition of the problem, the scope. Next, they mentioned the requirements of their project, the use cases that they will face, the database design they will use, the diagram of classes they designed for implementation, and the design practices for their projects. For me, the completeness of the design doc is great enough. Especially they offered the requirements and the use cases in the write-up because I didn't see these in the write-ups from other groups. And these make their idea more concrete and easier to understand.",,,-1,"The design docs is great and captures all the changes that need to be done in detail. I am happy that you have added visual aids such a screen shots, UMLS, code examples and stick figures These are very helpful for the overall design on the document. The is commendable.",,,-1,"In this current version, I think the author modify many things,  the author added some screen shots and background information, descriptions about the project's objective. All these parts can help reader understand this project more clearly and accurate. Additionality, The author also posts their changed codes into the design doc, I think it good! With the codes and figures, reader can understand the design doc easier.",,,1,"Most of the explanation has been done through visual cues. I was expecting some more textual based explanation because using visual aid I am only able to understand UI changes or UML Diagrams but now understanding the tasks that the team would accomplish to make these changes. Apart from that, very well documented.",,,-1,"The authors seriously needs to work on the design document, the authors have not provided any details about the changes to be made to the system. They have only provided the code snippet. How will the reviewer understand the reason these change needs to be there?",,,-1,"Yes.

And they are going to apply ""Do not Repeat Yourself (DRY)"" principle, which is also good for keeping the functionalities for themselves and other developers in the future. Although they are not going to use some fancy design pattern, such as the strategy design pattern. However, sometimes a simple idea is better than a fancy idea. But I found that they didn't mention the model part in their write-up, which is in charge of communicating with the database. It seems that they put too many jobs in the controllers, but some of jobs should be done in the models.",,,-1,"As it is, the design document incorporates all the functionality proposed. It is aimed and extending the scope of assignments from just regular class assignments to other types of submission and I think the team has implemented that well. Great use of class designs.",,,-1,"In all, I think this design doc is sound and follow appropriate principles, but in this design doc, I didn't see the design pattern used in this project, I think the author needs to add this part, with the illustration of design pattern used in this projcet, reader can get more clearly and accurate understanding of the jobs the author have done and check if these changes meet the appropriate design patterns.",,,-1,"Yes, the design does follow the appropriate design patterns and uses proper convention. They have only stated what kind of patterns they are going to use. They haven't mentioned the way in which these patterns would be implemented.

The addition of explanations to the code added and what they do it good and helpful.,,,-1,"I think for this part, the author did a good job, in the design doc, the author added many figure to help reader understanding the project, when I read this design doc, these figures help me a lot, I just follow the screen shots the author provided and do the same as the use case mentioned. I think this design doc is friendly for reader.",,,-1,"Yes, the design is simple and clear and to the point. The changes that the user plan to make are implemented in a concise manner which would not affect any other modules of expertiza.",,,1,"The design is simple and clear but missing important aspects such as explanation of design principles and patterns, proposed solution.",,,-1,"Yes. The design appear to be simple and clear.

Otherwise, the team should provide more details about the test plan for automated test cases.",,,1,"The test plan only described what events they are going to test, such as when users publish papers or users edit the attributes of papers. However, what I expect to see is what kind of tests they are going to implement, such as integration tests or unit tests. For the unit tests, what units and what corner cases they are going to test. For the integration tests, what controllers and what the flow of usage they are going to check. If they can mention these details more, this part will be easier for reviewers to understand their idea. ",,,1,The test plan is not comprehensive as it does not describe the tests or the framework to be used. The test plan just explains what is to be tested without actually specifying how to test. I expected to see at least mock-up code for the testing and the test framework to be used.,,,1,"Yes, I found this test part in the final of the design doc, but I don't think this test plan is complete enough, the author just brifely introduce some plans. I think the author needs to improve it, for example, can list some pre-conditions and  expected result.",,,1,I am not very convinced with the test plan for this project as it is a very shallow test plan. They haven't mentioned how to implement these tests and what the test cases will uncover. They need to follow a specific testing pattern to write these tests.,,,-1,They have described their test for UI but omitted the test plan for the methods to be written. I think it will be better if they can include the automated test plan.,,,-1,"The authors have included the test plan stating the automated tests they are going to implement, but I find them bit shallow.

They mention what they will test in the future, it is good. But they should add some example or demo of their code or pending test.",,,-1,Test plan is added which was previously not there. They have explained the test case that must be satisfied. ,,,-1,I think your need to add what your are planning to do with your project not what the page can do or that steps to get there.  You need to add the steps for your future project.,,,-1,Test plan is mentioned on how to do it manually. No scope for automated cases?

There does not seem to be server-side validation of many user actions, however.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The interface is straightforward, but has several form fields that are extremely particular and do not accept valid entries, often emptying the form on errors. For example, the LinkedIn profile field would not accept my (the reviewer) LinkedIn url as valid, and kept clearing the form every time.</p>",,,-1,<p>Was unable to find any instances of not following best practices.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes it follows good coding practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p>1. The code was written following good Ruby and Rails coding practices</p>
<p>2. There were lack of comments in the code, which is necessary for a new person reviewing the code base. For example in the companies controller, some amount of comments for each of the GET/PUT/POST methods would have been useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The proper naming convention i.e snake case for naming symbols, methods, variables and Camel case for classes has been used. In the models eg-Application model and other models used, the in-built DSL&nbsp; Rake methods such as validate, have been written without parentheses. The code is clear to read and self explanatory which doesn't necessitate comments.</p>
<p>There is a controller named as ApplicationTrackingSystemController. It violates the Ruby way of naming classes on nouns eg:-&nbsp; ApplicationsController, CompaniesController, JobController etc. The name ApplicationTrackingSystemController is the functionality of the entire app and doesn't illustrate the function of the class.</p>
<p>Single line definitions can be adapted for empty methods eg- In the show method of jobs_controller. The method can be defined as def show; end</p>
<p>In the Users Controller, there is a statement ""puts Viewing all users"". This statement can be displayed in the vie for the index method, thus clearly separating the role of Controller ad View</p>",,,1,"<p>It follows the best practices to the best of my own knowledge. I see most of the functionality its stored within the models, and the views do not perform business logic. The controllers implement the CRUD functionality required.&nbsp;Models contain validation fields and the errors returned are succinct and inform the user of how to correct their forms. To improve maybe add a password confirmation field in your /users/new functionality. Also include a method of preventing non-logged in people from accessing portions of the site they should not be able to. For instance I can visit the site while logged out and simply type /jobs and view all open jobs as a non-user.</p>",,,1,"<p>Your code looks great on GitHub!&nbsp; Most of the models, controllers, and views are setup similar to the scaffold build in RubyMine.&nbsp; One thing that I would recommend doing is either in your GitHub commit messages, your ReadME file or in your code, you should document any Ruby files that act as helpers to other Ruby files.&nbsp; For instance, try documenting any Ruby files that work with the gem Devise.&nbsp; I am not familiar with this gem and some documentation on why is it used would be helpful for me or any other reviewer to understand your thinking process for this project.</p>",,,1,"<p>I like your use of third-party gems, such as devise for authentication, to keep the coding ""clean"" and readable.&nbsp; I would suggest also using ""CanCanCan"" and ""Rolify"" for authorization.&nbsp; There is also a tutorial for using the three gems in conjunction(Devise+CanCanCan+Rolify).</p>",,,-1,"<p>I think they did an excellent job especially they thoroughly completed the authorizations of controllers by using ""before_action""</p>
<p>But there're still a few flaws:</p>
<p>1.there is no validation for company attributes except for company name.</p>
<p>2.In user model, user should not ""belong_to"" company because a user can be a job seeker who doesn't have such a foreign key. (you may add ""optional: true"" to ""belong_to :company"")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.In the partial ""_form.html.erb"" of user view, the company selection field will be shown in both recruiter and job seeker signup view and make choosing a company mandatory. (you may create a radio button for selecting role and a if statement before company selection field)</p>",,,1,<p>Code is clear and easy to follow. Use of enums for types in model would make it easier to update in the future and easier to use throughout the application.</p>,,,-1,<p>The interface is simple and intuitive while there is not much information in README.</p>,,,1,"<p>You all have done a good job following the ""good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". It looks like all of your major components were built using a rails scaffold, which is good because it helps to organize the code in a good ""ruby on rails"" way.&nbsp; You also did a good job following all of the ruby on rails style guidelines such as using ""each"" were it is appropriate over ""for"", and using 2 space indentation.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have taken one star off though because you did not comment all of your code very well.&nbsp; Specifically the models could use with some documentation.&nbsp; For example, ""app/models/company.rb"" has no documentation.&nbsp; While it isn't necessarily a difficult to understand file with only 4 lines of code, it would still be helpful for anyone working on the project say in the future to know exactly what the model is used for.&nbsp; It could be adding something simple such as a small inline comment explaining what the validation is for, and what the model is used for as a whole.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows good practise. The readme is also well defined.</p>,,,1,"<p>Easy to follow and use the user interface here. I like the big jumbotron approach. Also the table views for indexing having lines delimiting the columns and rows makes it easier to read. I would maybe see if you change the ""been clicked"" color of the links in the home page.

The README file contains the login credentials of the admin. The app is simple to use and the flow of views comes naturally without having to search all over the place. I appreciate the optimistic ""Find your Dream Job, guaranteed!"" message at the welcome page and also the Help prompt.&nbsp;The Home and Logout button are available on all pages and thus making navigation easy for the user. also,the password authentication is much like the ones that most websites use.One suggestion would be to keep the Log-In and Sign-Up links next to each other just as a matter of convenience.The README file also instructs the user to run <strong>rails db:seed</strong> to initialize admin details. I was able to correctly login in as admin so you might want to edit that line from the file.</p>",,,-1,<p>The interface is quite user friendly and easy to use.

There are some missing functionality buttons. I cannot seem to find a logout feature/button, nor an apply button when viewing an open job listing. I would suggest including these two buttons to make the user interface with the system more intuitive. I am also not sure which/what system you are using to deploy the production version of this system but I would also suggest updating the URL to something more human readable if possible. Overall a good job with room for improvement. I really like the table view you added to your index and show values, where there are lines separating the cells.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The application was very intuitive to follow through&nbsp; and also was visually appealing .

Implementation in small pieces allows for the project to develop more fluidly, and is less prone to error.&nbsp; Good job!&nbsp; One suggest I have with regards to pushing, is using issues.&nbsp; Using issues helps to segmentation the project, and allows for chunks of code to be pushed toward an issue.&nbsp; This is something my team did not do either, but we are going to try it in the future.&nbsp; Maybe consider using github issues in the future as well!</p>",,,-1,<p>There are git commits for every new feature implemented.

The interface is more than what was asked for and hence is appealing. The topic wise links is a smart move, which helps fluidity across pages.&nbsp;<br /> One improvement in terms of moving across pages is including a Home page button that would take us back to the home screen rather than hitting the Back button multiple times. The back button is missing when an admin tries to create an account and there is no option to cancel as well. Also the placement of the Back button changes across different pages. Keeping it constant (either at the top or bottom) would be helpful. Also, the placement of the Logout button could be better (probably place on top-right) since it's too close to other links and I ended up clicking that by mistake.</p>",,,1,"<p>The website is easy to use, but it lacks the instruction in the README file.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think they did an excellent job on&nbsp;project code.

For eg: In Companies controller, after line 71 that contains the private access specifier, there should be an indentation for the code that follows. Also, the index.html.erb in views contain redundant table rows. Eg: Line 42-50 of users/index.html.erb.<br />Overall, Ruby coding practices have been followed well.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is developed in good standards.

However, I think the views have a lot of ""if-else"" statements - we've learned in class that most of the code should be in the model. It's probably easier to write code directly in the views, but it might not be very maintainable in the long run. Another thing that I noticed is that you guys have used an integer to represent user type, and check for the type of user in the view to render certain elements on the page. I think it would be better to use an&nbsp;<strong>enum</strong> in place of the integers - that would make your code more readable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, I noticed that there are some buttons such as ""deleting a company that a user is not a part of"" that is displayed for every recruiter or job-seeker. While you guys do generate an ""Access denied"" message if these buttons are clicked, I think they need to be displayed based on the type of user that is logged in.</p>

<p>First, you should look back at your code and double check that your instance variable names correspond to the action(s) it is storing information in.&nbsp; For instance, in your recruiters controller, all of your controller actions except view_jobs are storing a recruiter user as @recruiters.&nbsp; You should only keep this pluralized name if you are gathering all recruiters from the database.&nbsp; Otherwise, you should use a singular name like @recruiter for the new, create, and destroy actions.&nbsp; Not only will this help differentiate in terms of what actions handle one or many recruiters, but it will also be easier to use each instance variable for other classes.</p>
<p>Another improvement is to document your Ruby files.&nbsp; While it may be a tedious task to do, it will ultimately help those reviewing your code, including myself, to understand your thinking process in terms of what new classes, methods, and instance variables you had to create for this project.&nbsp; Alternatively, you could also do the same for your git commit messages and explain changes that you have made to certain files.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code in git is clean and easy to follow.&nbsp; The use of enums in the model file for job_application status shows proper placement in a central and single location.</p>,,,-1,<p>The code is neat and easy to understand. Have followed the practices that are considered good.</p>,,,-1,<p>There is no changes in the readme. However the code has followed good practices.</p>,,,1,<p>Looks pretty straightforward scaffold generation with not much deviation. The job filtering mechanism is very clean and works well. Wondering why there are controllers for each type of user instead of 1 users controller? Having multiple controllers like this violates the DRY principle of ruby since these controllers do roughly the same things. Try to combine them into one users_controller and consolidate the three controllers into one.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The User interface is not that easy to navigate. For example take the following examples:</p>
<p>1. While logging in as an job seeker, the first user page that he encounters is cluttered and not easy to navigate</p>
<p>2. The ""Logout"" button is top of the ""Home "" button</p>
<p>3. While logging in&nbsp; even as an job seeker, the the companies dropdown is available which should not be the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The ReadMe file is well documented</p>",,,-1,<p>Default testing along with additional tests related to models and controllers has been done</p>,,,-1,<p>There are enough number of commits to justify that the team has constantly pushed their changes onto GitHub</p>,,,-1,"<p>90 commits by a 2 person team, very thorough in commits and updates.

The number of commits is also good that is 90 which is clear indication that the team is working on the project throughout the project period.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes the team has continued to push changes continuously.</p>,,,-1,<p>&nbsp;I am not sure if the team has only one member. I could not see other people's commit.</p>,,,1,"<p>The code followed the good Ruby and Rails coding practices. The code was well maintained. The code implemented almost all the functionality. But here are some points that I observed could be improved.</p>
<p>Points to improve</p>
<p>1) When the admin tries to create a user for the first time it pops up an error but creates the second time we create the user.</p>
<p>2) The URL&nbsp;could accept standard conditions or display appropriate messages to&nbsp;guide users in entering a valid URL.</p>
<p>3) The revenue field in a company&nbsp;is taking 0.0 for every input provided.</p>
<p>4) The job seeker also has a field company.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows good ruby and rails practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes the code on git follows good ruby and rails coding practices.</p>",,,1,"<p>Very intuitive, the views are nice. The home page buttons could be space slightly better but there is nothing wrong with them. For a few forms (user sign up/create/update) if you try to put a password that is too short it crashes. Update this so that instead it gives an error and tells the user what to change and to try again. On users there is also no validations for your phone number field. Please update the color of text after the buttons have been clicked, its hard to read them. I really like the Jobs in this company portion of the company show view, same for applications and jobs. The job seeker application process is a bit wonky, would add an apply button to job show and index.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The user interface is elegant and well designed. The navigation is easy but could make some changes to make it easier. Like guiding the user to enter text fields in an appropriate format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The README File contained information about admin login details and deployment&nbsp;details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The interface is easy to use.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Buttons on the main screen is not that user friendly.(becomes grey out after 1 use).</p>
<p>applying to a job is not straightforward.</p>",,,1,"<p>The spec folder has tests for the search controller and the user model. the tests are okay, they cover a decent amount of the possible paths, but they are not fully tested. The test folder contains the scaffold created tests, I do not see any team added tests in these files.</p>",,,1,<p>The team made good effort to test all the functionality of the application. They tested the models and controllers but there are some functional issues which I have mentioned in above review comments.</p>,,,1,<p>Models and controllers need to be tested.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Follows good ruby practices. The variables are stores in snack_case, the models contain the business logic, the controllers implement the CRUD functionalities, and the views are mainly there to provide the UI not to perform business logic.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Most of the code is straightforward scaffold generated code. So,it is easy to follow and well-written. The method search_companies is defined in ""search.rb"" file i.e.in the Model file. This can be done in the controller to clearly separate the M,V,C components of the architecture.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>A good practice was used in using helpers and models to implement business logic.&nbsp; The use of a separate Searches table could have been grouped with the companies and/or jobs logic.</p>,,,1,"<p>The UI is intuitive, the readme is slightly lacking but the UI doesn't need much explaining so its okay. When I attempt to create a new user with a blank password I expected a form error. Instead I got an error from Heroku saying something went wrong and to check the logs. When a recruiter is creating a new job you can hide the company select drop down.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the app is very interactive, user-friendly and easy to follow. The README provides login credentials for default users and like it says there, the app is pretty intuitive.It is very much like currently used job-finding portals. Only concern is that the text displayed in red color in the menu bar is not easily visible.</p>
<p>While searching for jobs using filters, there is a lot of scope for making mistakes while typing the search parameters. It would be easier to have a drop down for the filters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, after clicking back after viewing companies, jobs or job applications, it lands on the index view rather than going back to the previous page. So, we have to click on the Home page again to view all the actions.</p>",,,1,"<p>The role selection requirement was to allow the user to switch between roles.&nbsp; The use of a radio button for this would have been better than a checkbox.&nbsp; Also, adding an admin selection for the admin user should be present.</p>",,,-1,<p>The default tests which are generated after running scaffold has been implemented.</p>,,,1,"<p>Rspec testing done on the controller for companies, the model test for controllers is in the Test folder, but it lacking a few tests. Maybe instead create an rspec test file for the models.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The default tests have been done for one model and controller.</p>,,,-1,<p>they created a rspec folder for test</p>,,,-1,<p>13 more commits than last time. and three people contributed. just one of them only pushed one commits.</p>,,,1,"<p>The team made a lot of smaller commits, but some had a few days in between. There is a decent number of merges between different branches that might have been avoided if they had some communication among their commits/pushes. I might recommend just committing more often, 53 commits is a good number, but it could be slightly higher.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The user interface is very easy to use and attractive. The interface displays all the required information and links so that the user can easily access the application.</p>,,,1,"<p>While I really enjoyed the addition of the ""applications to this job"" and ""jobs in this company"" portion of the views, it really goes against DRY principles. The code is just copied and pasted from the index of the related model. Models are just validations, there are no methods abstracted into those files, and controllers are a bit bloated. The overall ruby practice is good though, the variables are snake_case, there are minimal global variables etc.</p>",,,-1,<p>Cannot find code for testing.</p>,,,1,"<p>There are some inconsistencies which were observed. For example the admin cannot edit application information,only the applicant can do so. Similarly the recruiter cannot destroy a company, only the admin can destroy a company. An applicant shouldn't be able to edit jobs which is being done here.</p>",,,1,"<p>1. The code in users_controller.rb&nbsp;can be dryer like what it looks like in other controller files. Extracting User.find params[:id] and params[:user].permit(:first_name, :last_name, ..) to become new private methods and then call these two methods from the public methods.</p>
<p>2. The if statements in update method is a little bit hard to read, maybe in this situation, you can add some clauses between conditions to make it easier to read.</p>",,,1,"<p>It seems no big problem.&nbsp;They followed the naming convention, properly used partials in views. Code is clean and well-written.</p>
<p>Maybe I can give a little advice:</p>
<p>If you do not need some actions in a particular controller, for example you do not need edit and show actions in dashboards_controller, then you do not need to write a blank method in it which may raise some issues when a user try to access them by URL, and instead you can write:</p>
<p>resources dashboards, only:[:index, :new, :create, :update, :destroy]</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is well structured throughout. Proper naming conventions have been used for variables, classes and methods. Devise has been used for authentication which is good. Most code is self-explanatory and commenting for code not auto-generated by Rails isn't necessary. The updates have been consistent with Ruby practices and MVC architecture.<br />However, as earlier, in controllers, after mentioning an access specifier, there should be an indentation. For eg: In Companies controller, after line 75 that contains the private access specifier, there should be an indentation for the code that follows. Also, the companies/index.html.erb in views contains redundant table rows. Eg: Line 41-48 of users/index.html.erb.<br />Overall, Ruby coding practices have been followed well.</p>",,,1,"<p>It's much better than I saw last time.<a name=""OLE_LINK3""></a><a name=""OLE_LINK1""></a><span style=""mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK2;""><span style=""mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK3;""><span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black;"">&nbsp;Apart from the functionalities specified in the requirement they did a lot extra user-friendly design.

The application is deployed on Heroku and README file is very well detailed out. It includes information about what the application is capable of and what it is not. So no issue in testing the application. The interface is more than what was asked for and hence is appealing and intuitive. I loved the way there was a sidebar giving the user necessary options.<br />An improvement could be that all options be listed out in the sidebar since initially I thought there was no way to view other users or applications. Another improvement could be to do an authorization check on the view level instead of just on the controller side. This would hide options such as 'Create'/'Edit' when the user is not allowed to. But I don't think this should result in any deduction of points. Great job!</p>,,,1,<p>Since the last review the UI has changed a lot. It has become easy to use and very informative.

However there is only 1 branch present</p>,,,-1,<p>The code on git follows good ruby and rails coding practices.</p>,,,1,"<p>The naming convention has been well through out</p>
<p>The indentation has been taken care of</p>
<p>There is a bit of Java style which has been followed for example array assignment in seesions, that could have been done a bit better but overall a very good code</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Your code on Git is very organized and everything based on what I saw follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices.&nbsp; I like how you organized your views for the admin, recruiter, and job seeker in separate folders so that you demonstrate specific functionalities for each User.&nbsp; Your models look good also.&nbsp; I noticed that for models like company and job that you don't have validations for your attributes to check if they are present or not.&nbsp; While it's not a major issue, I think that you should be checking if the user actually enters in information to create a Company.&nbsp; Otherwise, you are allowing the User to make blank Companies and Jobs associated with blank Companies, which would not be a good idea in a real world setting.</p>",,,-1,<p>The decision to make separate controllers for each role has allowed the team to separate business logic related to the different roles.</p>,,,-1,<p>The code is well written and formatted.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes.</p>,,,-1,<p>The code has followed good practices but readme needs to be more informative.</p>,,,1,"<p>1. README looks like a sample text file not being revised too much.</p>
<p>2. The user interface is not friendly, no ""back"" or ""home"" button for me to go to other pages.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the application is easy to use.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The Readme file gives a great deal of information about what the project is, who the admins are, how to start the project and what each role will do and what their functionality will be. I liked the way they have systematically given everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>User interface was very easy and intuitive!&nbsp; Well done!&nbsp; There were a few things I noticed and tested that I was not able to do below.&nbsp; I was not able to view the admin's profile due to a NoMethodError which states that the user is not associated with a company.&nbsp; When logging in as a Recruiter, I am not able to delete any of jobs he/she created due to again, a NoMethodError in which the user_id does not exist.&nbsp; Finally, while I was able to view applicants as a recruiter that posted an application for a job, I was not able to update the status of said application.&nbsp; Besides those, most of the functionality is present and the page routing looks efficient!</p>
<p>Some minors things I have with the program.&nbsp; While I don't mind the switching of user roles, it would be good to have this done when the user edits their profile so that one user is associated with one role.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can keep what you have, but only show the switching of job seeker or recruiter if the user has two accounts created in which one is a&nbsp;recruiter and one is a job seeker.&nbsp; By comparing emails between the same user, you can then allow them to switch easily rather them having to log out and log back in.</p>",,,1,<p>The screen real estate is used well.&nbsp; Switching between roles is easy.&nbsp; Using table borders in the View All pages would make the pages easier to follow visually.</p>,,,1,<p>The UI is pretty easy to understand but navigating through the pages is a bit tedious. Admin account has a lot of loopholes if a user is deleted. The readme is very well described but the navigation still is tedious.</p>,,,-1,<p>Navigation is a little tedious as some pages do not have Back option So interlinked links are difficult to get back to. Readme file is well described.</p>,,,1,<p>The UI is pretty easy to use. Can use more colors and components for UI.</p>,,,-1,<p>They got some&nbsp;code&nbsp;in the&nbsp;test files but I think they didn't run it to find out most of the bugs.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The recruiter model has some errors being displayed on the screen. For example, while viewing jobs posted by the recruiter, an error is displayed on the screen. Due to this, the recruiter cannot perform many of the tasks which he/she should be able to.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Other then default controller&nbsp;</p>
<p>Job application controller has been throughly tested and looked into, regex match has been looked into</p>",,,1,"<p>Thoroughly tested at least one model and one controller by Rails testing.&nbsp; If any of you are doing unit testing for the OSS project, I highly recommend you check out RSpec and practice writing tests on your application as practice so that you can use it for your OSS project.</p>",,,-1,<p>There are some tests for the job application model.</p>,,,-1,<p>The team has tested the applications model and applicants controller.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team has tested models and controllers for respective functionality.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. It is also present in the github readme.</p>,,,-1,<p>It looks like they just started it from six days ago which means they don't keep commiting&nbsp;during the period.</p>,,,-1,<p>The changes have been pushed regularly.</p>,,,1,"<p>the amount of commits is around 144, which does state the work has been continuesly pushed into but some of the later commits have been just about readme, but still the team did a good job in keeping the commits on time</p>",,,1,"<p>Based on the number of commits, it looks like a lot of your commits for the final submission week happened on the due date and after.&nbsp; While that's fine since you all contributed to the project, I think all of you should try to at least work and commit your changes every 2-3 hours a day so that you don't overwork yourselfs with getting everything done the day of submission.</p>",,,-1,<p>The commits have been fairly consistent throughout the project.</p>,,,-1,<p>There are a number of commits but most of them done on the day of deadline and a few after.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>Regular updates are done. Can go through bugs and change their code.</p>,,,1,"<p>The code is clear and easy to follow. However, it is pretty much the basic code generated by scaffold generation. In the authorize method of the application controller, the notice just says ""XYZ"". This could be changed to a more specific message.The homepage controller has only two empty methods, create and new. This implies that its function is just to manipulate the views. I feel that this could be implemented in the user controller itself instead of creating a new controller for it.</p>",,,1,"<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- No violations of Ruby on Rails coding practices.</p>
<p>- Proper naming conventions used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>- Validations need to be added. (regex, empty values, etc.)</p>
<p>- Relationships should be defined clearly. (eg: has many, belongs to)</p>",,,1,"<p>The code follows good Ruby on Rails coding practices. The code implements most of the functionality. The code was maintained properly in Git. However, There are some functionality issues that I have come across during my review process. They are</p>
<p>points to improve</p>
<p>1) The job seeker is associated with a company by default which needs to be changed.</p>
<p>2) The recruiter&nbsp;was not able to see the applications that the job seekers have&nbsp;applied.&nbsp;</p>

The controllers contain code for basic CRUD functionality. The views do not contain the logic and are used only for displaying necessary information to the user. Two space indentation was used instead of four space indentation. The team used DRY concepts and I couldn't find code duplication.

If there is one suggestion that I have for your team in the future, it would be try javadoc.&nbsp; Here is a helpful resource regarding javadoc and how to use it!&nbsp;https://dev.liferay.com/participate/javadoc-guidelines</p>",,,-1,"<p>The README file contains login credentials for admin. There is also information about the implementation all bundled into one paragraph. This is however just the specifications given as part of the project. It could contain more detail about how to use the app rather than listing out what has been implemented.</p>
<p>There is no Home button or Logout button on all views so it becomes difficult to navigate through the application.</p>",,,1,"<p>User interface is very simple and basic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>README can be formatted better with subheadings and bullet points. It is hard to read. Doesn't explain all possible things that can be done in the application clearly.</p>",,,1,<p>There is no user interface. All the actions can&nbsp;be performed through links. The user interface could have been much better.

<p>The application was deployed on the Heroku platform and the corresponding github repo was also shared. The deployment was done properly and I had no issues opening up the application and running it. As soon as I clicked on the deployed app link, I was redirected to the home page of the system, which was the login page. The database migrations were also done properly as I was able to register and login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;User interface:</p>
<p>The user interface was minimalistic and easy to use. Everything was self explanatory and most pages were linked properly. Only the back button of the view job applications page was wrongly linked, otherwise everything was fine.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the application has been deployed successfully.&nbsp; The user interface is clean, and though it is a little bland, it is easy to use.&nbsp; The ReadMe is helpful when getting up and running with the application.&nbsp; It does a good job explaining how to login as an admin and such.&nbsp; One area I see for improvement still is in the readme layout and styling.&nbsp; Github allows for the use of markup to style and edit readme and wiki documents on github.&nbsp; This is a great tool for creating tables, headers, and bullet points to help make documents more readable.&nbsp; If I were to give your team one suggestion moving forward with this section, it would be to give markup a try to help make the ReadMe and other documentations more readable.&nbsp; Here is a helpful resource regarding markup shortcuts, and how to use them!&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet</p>",,,-1,"<p>No, the testing has not been implemented.</p>",,,1,<p>The models and controllers&nbsp;have not been tested properly. The code for testing the models and controllers is not present. The could also have developed the testing code.</p>,,,1,"<p>The admin model hasn't been tested at all. The configured email and password is not being authenticated.&nbsp; When the show button is clicked while viewing the company/job information , the recruiter is being able to edit the job &amp;/ company info even if not belonging to that company. Furthermore, if a recruiter leaves a company, the jobs created by him/her are retained and can be edited/destroyed by the same recruiter which shouldn't happen according to the spec file. All these things should be take care of . You just have to put certain conditions in the appropriate views to display links to certain pages.</p>",,,1,"<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml>

For future projects, I would recommend to start pushing early and have more frequent commits. This will ensure continuous integration practices are followed.</p>",,,1,"<p>It does not appear that the team pushed many changes to the project as there were only 3 commits to master.&nbsp;&nbsp;Committing and pushing to github regularly is helpful for many reasons.&nbsp; One, it makes building a large, shared application much easier as everything can be built in little bite sized pieces.&nbsp; And two, it helps the rest of the team know what is going.&nbsp; Github provides two really helpful features I suggest you trying to use in the future.&nbsp; These are branches and issues.&nbsp; With issues, you are able to lay out a plan for your project and assign little pieces of the plan to each of the members of your team.&nbsp; This way, everyone can contribute, and knows what everyone else is working on.&nbsp; Branching is helpful, as it allows you to make a new branch for each issue.&nbsp; This way, when you are merging into master, the only changes that need to be reviewed are those that are contributing towards a specific issue.&nbsp; This makes it easier for the reviewers to understand whats going on and keeps the team all on the same page.&nbsp; Hope this helps!</p>",,,-1,"<p>In the companies _form view there is a long list of options to select that are placed on subsequent lines and im unsure if thus would count as good practice. I dont know if the good coding practices include the logical if statement within the jobs index view page, as this sort of style is well known to be used in other languages such as Java or C. Throughout the models, there seems to be a great use of ancestry to create the relationships that make the MVC idea work well. Within the controllers, i can see that you all used the relationships between the controllers and views well, to create the logic for searching through the list of jobs in the jobs_controller ruby file.</p>
<p>After looking through all of the project, I think you all showed pretty good instances of rails design, though im unsure of a few matters. Truth be told, i think my group did a similar type of if conditional, just wondering myself if a better option is available.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows good ruby and rails coding practices. They have maintained the required MVC structure.</p>,,,1,"<p>They create really similar models and similar controllers. Controllers, like admin, job seeker, recruiter could be just one controller. Models, too, like, auser, ruser, user, jobseeker, recruiter, admin could be just one model.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has followed good Ruby and Rails coding practices. The code was properly maintained and well organized.</p>
<p>The team has improved a lot of functionality changes when compared to the first submission. There are so many functional improvements. I observed some other changes that need&nbsp;to be added/improved to make the application much better.</p>
<p>Points to improve</p>
<p>1) Headquarters should have been a text field instead of existing states.</p>
<p>2) Company field could be dropdown of existing companies.</p>
<p>3) Website Url validation regex could be much better to accept different types of website URLs.</p>
<p>4) Job seeker account cannot be created from admin.</p>
<p>5) The Recruiter was able to publish jobs for any company.</p>
<p>6) The Recruiter was not able to view applicants for a job.</p>
<p>7) The job seekers functionality is not implemented. Like job seeker is not able to sign up and login etc.</p>",,,-1,"<p>From the looks of it, the team followed good ruby and rails coding practices. The controllers were simple and easy enough to manage. However, they seemed to have been unchanged from the one the the default scaffold generator makes. The models also seemed pretty standard (they give associations and validations in the models). The team used the models. Unlike the other teams' work that I have reviewed, this team defined a functions in the model for other part of the app to use, which is definitely the ruby on rails way of doing something. The example is job.rb. The team also made their veiws straightforward. THey mostly avoided using ruby code in the views, which kept things nice to look at. Overall, the team used the MVC well.</p>",,,1,"<p>Naming does appear to have taken care of, every controller name gives specifically what it doing like the widget contoller or static page controller,</p>
<p>I would suggest that that the admin, jobseeker and recruiter controller should have been clubbed and formed as a user controller, it would have been better</p>
<p>I would suggest using before_action even in job application controller</p>
<p>Naming is good and one can get a clear picture of what it does</p>
<p>comments is something i didnt find</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The code is easy to understand follows the good ruby and rails practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes the code was well written. It&nbsp; followed the MVC architecture , and functionality was also goof</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is well structured throughout. Proper naming conventions has been used for variables, classes and methods. Most code is self-explanatory and commenting for code not auto-generated by Rails isn't necessary. The access specifiers have proper indentation for the code following it. Devise has been used for authentication. So everything good there.</p>
<p>However, devise authentication hasn't been used the way it should have. Roles should be used to manage access to certain pages. Even a recruiter can view all users of the application via the url. Also, there is some redundancy in the code like creating multiple views for each user when it could have been done using one.</p>",,,1,"<p>Y'all seemed to use good ruby conventions/practices including the model-view-controller architecture and the coding syntax.&nbsp; In addition you had a large number of commits from different people. You did not use the ""issues"" tab from git but I don't view that as a necessity but it would have been nice to have (still gave you full points).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The UI is rather understandable, though i'm not sure what happened with the Job Seeker functionality. Perhaps it wasn't able to get working, but it doesnt seem like they can do anything but edit their profile from what i saw. Other than that, I had no trouble, and i like the way you all listed the actions that could be taken down the page. It made it easy to locate the option i was looking for, as well as telling me who was logged in at the top of the page.</p>",,,-1,<p>The user interface is quite user friendly and display all the required information. Although for the Job seeker the views lack certain links apart from that everything else works just fine.</p>,,,1,"<p>The user interface is a little bit confusing. Especially the part, where admin creates new jobseeker or new recruiter, who is actually logged in at the end? Both the admin and new created user?</p>
<p>And it seems like when admin creates job seeker, the email in the job seeker's profile is not the one admin just used to create the account.</p>
<p>README helps a bit. Just feel it is an interesting design choice.</p>
<p>I think it is because of the cross model visits. The same link would trigger different behaviors. (such as if admin creates a recruiter, and tries to create another one, it won't go back to the signin page anymore, it will just go to recruiters/new). Here is a solution I found (point 6):</p>
<p>https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-to-Setup-Multiple-Devise-User-Models</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for a job seeker to be able to view companies and jobs, he needs to type in the url by himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>There is no user interface. There are links to perform actions. The user interface could have been much better.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>I tried to login as an admin, but I got the error below. I also got the same error when I tried to sign up as either a recruiter or a job seeker. As a result, I could not test this app well. However, from the looks of it, the UI seems to be a little too complicated. For example, there are 5 links on the login screen, each of which allows the user to login as an admin/recruiter/job seeker or sign up as a recruiter/job seeker. This seems excessive and the code could definitely made more DRY.</p>

<p>The view is clean, it gives enough information on whats going on and what actions are possible</p>
<p>Its a bit complicated in understanding what create recruiter means after i have signed up as recruiter, it creates a bit of confusion</p>
<p>there should be a option of having no company even for the recruiter</p>
<p>The readme is pretty descriptive&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The UI is intuitive to some extent but some times it is difficult to navigate as there is no back button that is consistently present in all the pages. The readme briefly but precisely explains what is expected of the application.</p>,,,-1,<p>The user interface was clear to understand&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The application is deployed on Heroku and admin details and certain applications details are provided in the README file, so that's a plus. The interface is simple and nothing fancy which is alright since that is not the focus of this application. However, the interface is lacking the navigation and fluidity that it should have. It could have a single log in and sign up rather than having multiple options to do so based on role. Also, the job seeker doesn't seem to have any options but to update profile.</p>",,,-1,"<p>User interface is a little hard to use. Having sign in/sign up options for different roles is confusing.&nbsp; Would be nice just to have 1 sign in option.&nbsp; Also the searching of jobs for a job seeker is not working for me.&nbsp; But overall, seem to have most of the functionality working</p>",,,-1,"<p>No, it seems all i could locate is the scaffold created controller tests that test basic functionality, and empty model test files. It does not seem like they implemented anything of the sort that I believe was required.</p>",,,-1,<p>No code for testing is seen.</p>,,,-1,<p>They did use rspec to do the testing. But the testing is not that thoroughly. Only one test case for model widget. I didn't really understand the purpose of this model widget.</p>,,,-1,<p>The team seems to have tested the models and controllers but there is no testing code implemented to test models and controllers.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team seems to have tested their controllers. However, the test for the controllers is very similar to the default ones tat are created by the scaffold generator. Furthermore, none of the models were tested.</p>",,,-1,"<p>They have used rspec for widgets which is something i found good.</p>
<p>Default test cases found only for controller</p>
<p>I was not able to find test for models, i did look into rspec and test package</p>",,,-1,<p>couldnt find full testing though rspec was present&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>Default test cases are available for Controllers in the test folder. The team has used Rspec for testing which is good. However, it would be helpful to test one of the important models like Company / Job/ Applications.</p>",,,1,<p>Yes the company model/controller seems to be thoroughly tested.&nbsp; All functionality seems to be avaliable</p>,,,1,"<p>I think the range they committed from was pretty good, since they committed through two weeks the majority of their commits. They committed slightly more than half across the week of February 18th and the rest basically one day in the next week. Perhaps that could have been spread out better, but other than that I think they showed a good push history.</p>",,,-1,<p>There are enough number of commits to justify that the team has constantly pushed their changes onto GitHub.</p>,,,1,"<p>They have 54 commits, and 2 branches. But I think they mainly work on the master's branch, which is not that a good practice. But I know it is hard to integrate work.</p>",,,-1,<p>The Team has got a good number of commits that is 54. And the team also made several changes throughout the project.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team seems to have started on the project very recently (Feb 18). However, they seem to have been making a lot of commits to the repo since then. To be exact, the team made 44 overall commits to the repo, with the last one being 5 days ago.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There was a gap of almost 6 days between last commit and prev one, which does seem a bit odd, but after careful looking into it, it was just related to bugs so it does show they looked into the errors and rectified them. Commits do seem to be evenly distributed&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has been consistently pushing their changes throughout the term of the project.</p>,,,-1,<p>Continuous commits were observed</p>,,,1,"<p>The number of commits on Git is impressive. It looks like the team has been working on it regularly. However, the number of commits by each member of the team is skewed and it does not seem like the work has been divided equally. This could have been justified by stating what work each member did in the README.</p>",,,1,"<p>Not really.&nbsp; After the initial due date there was period of inactivity and then some inactivity for 1 single day.&nbsp; I don't necessarily think this is bad if there was not much to fix but considering some things could still be fixed in this, I think it could have been worked on a little more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>In the jobs_controller.rb file I see if statements that were checking a negative condition in the search method; for this type of set up, 'unless' could be used as a ruby term to represent that negative condition better. Also this if structure seems reminiscent of Java or C, and could potentially be done in a better way. I do see good use of the sessions_helper.rb file in the project, which I have come to appreciate through the completion of my own team's project. Helper classes can be very useful to return functionality with great coding practices. The models have the good ancestry and relationships set up between models, to allow the sort of functionality needed in the system. The homepage index view file seems to have a lot of embedded ruby code, which I believe is not indicative of good coding practice. I think some of the functionality, such as figuring out which type of user is signed in, could be levied to the controller, where you then use what the controller returns to decide how the view responds. Other than these specific instances, I think the rest of the project is set up in a great way.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows MVC architecture and shows good Ruby and Rails coding practices.</p>,,,1,"<p>Your code still follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices.&nbsp; Your models/views/controller look good in terms of functionality, establishing relationships between classes, and your routing from page to page.&nbsp; I did notice some files that were blank as I was looking through your code.&nbsp; For example, a few controllers like welcome_controller.rb and homepages_controller.rb contains just the template and nothing else.&nbsp; In the future, you can individually make your own files in the terminal if you need just a model/view/controller (i.e. rails generate(or g) model Model_Name Model_attributes).&nbsp; There's a scaffold I believe for models/views/controllers also if you prefer to use RubyMine's way of generating code.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There looked to be Java/C++ conventions (for example, != """" instead of .blank? or .nil? and if blocks instead of if/unless at end of statement.&nbsp; While not necessarily a coding practice, there was no validation of user access in the controllers, only the views.&nbsp; Also more of a general Git convention, they uploaded things like tmp files that shouldn't be committed.</p>",,,-1,<p>The ruby and rails practices are followed</p>,,,1,"<p>The code is well structured throughout. Proper naming conventions has been used for variables, classes and methods. Most code is self-explanatory and commenting for code not auto-generated by Rails isn't necessary. MVC framework was followed.<br />However, in controllers, after mentioning an access specifier, there should be an indentation. This has been done in most cases however it is missing in the Applications Controller starting line 65. Also, you could have used Devise for authentication. Entire information regarding jobs/user/companies/applications was visible/editable/delete-able by any user which shouldn't be the case. <br />Overall, Ruby coding practices have been followed well.</p>",,,-1,<p>Wel written in ruby format. Naming conventions appear to have been followed.</p>,,,-1,"<p>I think their UI was quite extensive in that I was able to locate every action I needed to verify. All of the actions were nicely listed and when I clicked on them they brought me to the logical next place in the website that tells me the information I requested. It was also nicely outlined in the README file, where you can locate the paths to test every single aspect of the website, which I think was definitely a nice touch.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The user interface is very simple and easy to understand It provides the necessary links. But certain views are not properly detailed. Certain views show links that are not needed in that view, like a recruiter should only be able to view the available jobs there is no need to provide an apply link for the job for the recruiter view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Application is successfully deployed on Heroku platform.&nbsp; The user interface is&nbsp;basic to function and is not too distracting despite not having any CSS styling pages.&nbsp; Most of the functionalities for each User is present except for a few functionalities with a Job Seeker.&nbsp; Your filtering system is present in the Jobs View page, but doesn't function when trying to filter jobs based on a company.&nbsp; All I am treated to is a blank page.&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing you could do to improve on your filters is to use a dropdown menu of existing items instead of asking the user to type in what to search for.&nbsp; While this may not be good in the real world, for a small program like this, I think this is appropriate to include so that job seekers can easily find jobs based on available company information in the system.</p>
<p>The resume uploader doesn't seem to work even though I can include files while creating an application.&nbsp; When I look to edit the page, it doesn't stay selected next to the Upload File button.&nbsp; I don't know much about uploading files in Ruby, but you could do some research of other people's code to see how they implemented it correctly.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It wasn't easy/clear to switch between jobseeker/recruiter role.&nbsp; While technically possible, you had to disable one role to make it work.&nbsp; As a recruiter, you couldn't see the companies in a list.&nbsp; Job applications had no way to see the job they were connected to which made it difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to do anything useful with the job applications.</p>",,,1,<p>Readme file has been defined well.user interface could have a home button to make navigation easier and efficient.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The application is deployed on Heroku and the admin details are provided in the README file and there are some more lines about the application. So no issue in testing the application. The interface is simple and gets the job done.<br />However, that being said, it was difficult to navigate around because the admin could be deleted and thereafter I couldn't test further functionality of the admin. Also, the README says a user can login using gmail and receive notifications using a gmail id. But neither worked for me.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the application has been deployed successfully on heroku.&nbsp; It works very well and is easy to use and understand.&nbsp; On top of this, the Read me documentation is very easy to follow and informative!&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The test was done on the jobs_controller and model by simply testing the scaffold generated file. I think we were supposed to test extra aspects, but if not then this requirement was satisfied.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has only tested the Jobs controller. According to the spec file a model and a controller has to be tested</p>,,,-1,"<p>Only the controller for jobs was tested, and it is not thoroughly tested.</p>",,,-1,<p>Controllers had autogenerated tests and Job controller also had a single RSpec test implemented. There were no tests on the models.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Models need to be tested, controller&nbsp; is checked</p>",,,-1,"<p>The default tests for controllers are present in the test folder.

Also, there are no tests for any of the models.</p>",,,1,"<p>The jobs controller was thoroughly tested using proper rspec techniques.&nbsp; The tests were well named and easy to follow and understand.&nbsp; On top of that, the team did a good job testing all of the crud operations associated with each controller.&nbsp; What I did not see though, was model testing.&nbsp; This should definitely be added, for instance, filling out ""test/models/compnay_test.rb"" shouldn't be difficult.&nbsp; For some information on how testing in ruby on rails works, I would suggest this resource.&nbsp; http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html</p>",,,-1,<p>Only tested one controller.

In fact there were only 2 commits before the first review period and then the rest of their commits came in the next week before the final review time was to take place. Not only was it in this last week, but centered around one day, so they pushed at the very end basically. Honestly you can get into trouble with this sort of approach, especially if you are working for some client and they just don't know how anything is turning out.

<p>Points to improve</p>
<p>1) When the admin tries to create a user for the first time it pops up an error but creates the second time we create the user.</p>
<p>2) The URL&nbsp;could accept standard conditions or display appropriate messages to&nbsp;guide users in entering a valid URL.</p>
<p>3) The revenue field in a company&nbsp;is taking 0.0 for every input provided.</p>
<p>4) The job seeker also has a field company.</p>",,,-1,"<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes the code on git follows good ruby and rails coding practices.</p>",,,-1,<p>The user interface is very easy to use and attractive. The interface displays all the required information and links so that the user can easily access the application.</p>,,,1,"<p>Very intuitive, the views are nice. The home page buttons could be space slightly better but there is nothing wrong with them. For a few forms (user sign up/create/update) if you try to put a password that is too short it crashes. Update this so that instead it gives an error and tells the user what to change and to try again. On users there is also no validations for your phone number field. Please update the color of text after the buttons have been clicked, its hard to read them. I really like the Jobs in this company portion of the company show view, same for applications and jobs. The job seeker application process is a bit wonky, would add an apply button to job show and index.</p>",,,-1,<p>Follows good practices</p>,,,1,"<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml>

<p>It can be seen that the code follows heavy java convention, but that comes naturally for java developers</p>
<p>I liked the fact that before action was used well</p>",,,1,<p>The application seems to follow good ruby on rails coding practices. Most of the code is scaffold generated hence they strictly adhere to the applications structure for MVC. They code is also properly formatted with proper indentation. One things missing is the lack of comments in the code. The authors could improve on that.</p>,,,1,"<p>The code looks good and ""dry"", and the team followed &ldquo;good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". However, I&rsquo;d give some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;use indentations: for instance, when declaring &ldquo;private&rdquo; (applications_controller.rb, line 35). It makes a declaration more visually noticeable.</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;use blank lines between methods (applications_controller.rb), which improves readability.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- [if !supportLists]--></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the code is very properly maintained with using suitable dependencies in database and proper test modules for every task in models, views and controllers&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The controllers' code is sometimes not DRY. For example, the team specifically checks if the user is logged in with ""<span class=""pl-k"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: #d73a49; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Menlo, Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; white-space: pre;"">if</span> <span class=""pl-k"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; color: #d73a49; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Menlo, Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; white-space: pre;"">!</span><span style=""color: #24292e; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Menlo, Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; white-space: pre;"">logged_in?</span>"" in the companies_controller.rb&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of this, they can use a before_action in someplace thats more common for the flow of code (like the application_controller.rb). The code in the controllers also seems to ""play it safe"" when creating or editing things (they use new and save instead of functions like create! or save!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also did a decent job with the models. They look for validations and assign associations between the models. In the views, the ""code"" was simple enough to follow. The team did not fill the vies with ruby code too, which is good.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code is well formatted and easy to understand.</p>,,,-1,<p>pretty good.</p>,,,1,"<p>In general, it is easy to navigate within the team's web application. I think it's&nbsp;good&nbsp;that they added some additional instructions on UI in README.&nbsp;Although, I'd like to give some suggestions that would probably improve the UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding ""home"" (for an easy jump to homepage) and ""log out"" buttons would be helpful on every page, maybe, in the upper right corner.</li>
<li>Keeping ""back"" button&nbsp;consistently at the same spot throughout the web app, maybe, even a little bit away from other buttons.</li>
<li>Adding drop-down lists for&nbsp;Employment Type,&nbsp;Gender,&nbsp;Race,&nbsp;Veteran Status,&nbsp;Disability Status.</li>
<li>Making 'additional information' for a job application optional.</li>
</ul>",,,1,<p>&nbsp;The README could be made more clear with different sections for each user type</p>,,,1,"<p>The user interface was slightly hard to use. In my opinion, there were too many clicks to get to applying for a job. By looking at the URL in the browser (and in routes.rb), I see that you guys have 3-level nested resources. This may be a bad idea. I suggest looking at the following link for more information:</p>
<p>https://medium.com/@jaredrayjohnson1/4-things-i-learned-toying-around-with-nested-resources-in-rails-fed6d761e924</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the readme.txt on github provided enough information for me to get started.</p>",,,-1,<p>The UI is not very intuitive. Much of the things are cluttered in a small space. Routes are somewhat haywire and are not very well defined. The readme is well described but doesn't compensate for the lack of intuitiveness in the UI.</p>,,,-1,"<p>a little bit too simple, also has no design.</p>",,,1,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">I went through each file in test/models, and couldn&rsquo;t find any tests for any model.&nbsp; There are some tests in test/controllers folder though. Some information on tests in README would be helpful.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One suggestion is to restrict some data types on data fields. Like, revenue should be only integer, phone number should be max 15 digits long, email addresses should follow conventions.</p>",,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;Yes, they have made test modules for every controller and view</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team seems to have tested&nbsp;job_applications_controller_test.rb thoroughly enough. They have tests like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - should get index</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - should get new</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - should update job_application</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - etc.</p>
<p>Tough the team seems to have tested this controller, the tests also seem to be very similar to the ones that get automatically made by the scaffold generator. The team did not fully test any model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The companies model is tested.</p>,,,-1,<p>they write rspec test for almost all the files. a pretty good work.</p>,,,-1,<p>The team did a great job using&nbsp;github.</p>,,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;yes, the changes done were throughout the period and uniform</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team seems to have started on the project early enough. The first commit was about 20 days ago, and the most recent commit was 5 days ago. Throughout this period, most of the commits seemed to have enough change to the app to be notable.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has been consistently pushing changes throughout the term of the project.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>over 120 commits, they really did a hard work.</p>",,,1,"<p>They didn't use gem to help them build log in system.

I need to learn from them.</p>
<p>Another thing they did very good is that they uses model's method in the application model to help listing all the applications for a job seeker. I think we did it in the controller. I like their way better.</p>
<p>I gave 4 stars:</p>
<ol>
<li>because they put a lot of logic in their views, such as index.html.erb for companies and jobs, trying to hide edit/delete button from job seeker or recruiter. I feel what you need to do is using authorization gem such as ""pundit"" to restrict user's ability for some actions on the website. Hiding buttons is good. But I don't think it is enough. Job seeker can still go to ""https://fathomless-brook-57752.herokuapp.com/companies/1/edit"" for editing companies.</li>
<li>(I don't know where to put this point, I will put it here) because I tried to update user's profile, eg ""Name"", but it kept tell me to include ""@"", I felt strange, so I went back to ""views/devise/registartions/edit.html.erb"", yes, you made a tiny mistake in line 16, by indicating that name field is an email field.</li>
</ol>",,,-1,<p>It follows good ruby and rails coding practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p>They must've made their github page private because I cannot access it. I get a 'Page not found' error. As a result, I could not access their admin details...</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes</p>,,,-1,"<p>The interface is probably the best among what I review.</p>
<p>They improved a lot since my last review, by indicating what the website is for and what can user do after logging in.</p>
<p>I gave 4 stars, because as an admin, there is button ""Your Applications"" -- I think what they mean is actually all the applications. And there is another button ""Users"" -- I think it is supposed to show all the users, but it will give you the error (page does not exist).</p>",,,-1,<p>It is easy to use.</p>,,,-1,<p>The UI is VERY pleasing to use. It seems to have been professionally made. All the parts of the application were easily accessible from the toolbar at the top. Well done.</p>,,,-1,<p>The UI is neat and easy to use.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the user interface is easy to use. There should be a prompt for the jobseeker that he/she cant apply till they have updated their profile.</p>
<p>Readme is well stated.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I don't think the team has tested thoroughly one model or one controller. Is it in the spec folder? There are only three test&nbsp; cases. In the test folder, I only find rails default testing. We didn't do well on testing either. So let us do better next time.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The admin model has some problems: 1. When clicked to show users, an error screen was displayed 2. The admin cannot destroy all companies, just the ones created by him/her as a recruiter 3. The admin shouldn't be able to edit company info which he can in this application.</p>

Some even after</p>,,,1,"<p>Your code still follows good Ruby and Rails coding practices.&nbsp; Your models/views/controller look good in terms of functionality, establishing relationships between classes, and your routing from page to page.&nbsp; I did notice some files that were blank as I was looking through your code.&nbsp; For example, a few controllers like welcome_controller.rb and homepages_controller.rb contains just the template and nothing else.&nbsp; In the future, you can individually make your own files in the terminal if you need just a model/view/controller (i.e. rails generate(or g) model Model_Name Model_attributes).&nbsp; There's a scaffold I believe for models/views/controllers also if you prefer to use RubyMine's way of generating code.</p>",,,1,"<p>The user interface is very simple and easy to understand It provides the necessary links. But certain views are not properly detailed. Certain views show links that are not needed in that view, like a recruiter should only be able to view the available jobs there is no need to provide an apply link for the job for the recruiter view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The default tests for controllers are present in the test folder. The team has however used Rspec for testing which is good. They have tested the Jobs controller. However I do not feel it is thoroughly tested. Also, there are no tests for any of the models.</p>",,,1,"<p>The commits were not that spread out. In fact there were only 2 commits before the first review period and then the rest of their commits came in the next week before the final review time was to take place. Not only was it in this last week, but centered around one day, so they pushed at the very end basically. Honestly you can get into trouble with this sort of approach, especially if you are working for some client and they just don't know how anything is turning out. I would definitely recommend pushing new functionality each week as a much better practice to become familiar with.</p>",,,-1,"<p>A good number of commits since the last review. However, it would have been good to see an equal or almost equal contribution from all members. One seems to have contributed very low towards the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code looks great. The team followed &ldquo;good Ruby and Rails coding practices"". They use indentations and blank lines appropriately.&nbsp;Just one&nbsp;suggestion: breaking some lines in your code into several would improve readability (line&nbsp;85&nbsp;applications_controller.rb, ln 41 in&nbsp;companies_controller.rb).</p>",,,1,"<p>The code for the most part follows good coding practices.The code is clearly written and is easy to understand for the most part.However, the use of comments especially for non-scaffold generated methods will help the user to understand the code much better. For eg:- filter function in the jobs controller.</p>
<p>Some of the empty-body methods can be written in a single line For eg:- ""show"" and ""edit"" method in users_controller. In the applications controller, there are parameters ""j_id"" and ""job_id"" which is slightly confusing.</p>
<p>Also, there are two controllers application_controller for authorization of users and applications_controller which handles CRUD methods for job applications. You could name it differently to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Methods for destroying and closing an application have been defined in the Model ""application.rb"" and similarly, in the Job Model file ""job.rb"" This negates the use of MVC architecture where the controller controls the interpretation of actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Everything a user could see (job applications/jobs/companies) could also be edited by adding /edit to the url even though the edit button was hidden. A jobseeker could also add companies and jobs by adding /new to the url. This means the controller wasn't doing the same validation checks that the view was.</p>,,,-1,<p>The code is easy to understand and follows the good Rails coding practices.</p>,,,-1,<p>looks pretty good.</p>,,,1,"<p>It's pretty easy to navigate within the team's web application. They have drop-down lists whenever it's useful and appropriate, which makes it easier to choose, not typing. They also added&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;additional instructions on their UI in README, which could be a bit shorter.&nbsp;There is one suggestion I would give to the team&nbsp;that would probably improve the UI: -Putting&nbsp;""home page"" and ""log out"" buttons in the upper right corner, which would&nbsp;make them more visually noticeable, and prevent an accidental log out case.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The last time, when I checked the deployed app on 03/05/2018, the app was not working. However,it seems to be working fine now.</p>
<p>The layout of the app is clean and simple and easy to follow. There was no confusion in navigating the app. However, it took quite some time to enter the address in proper format. Same goes for the website and revenue while creating a company. You may put a sample address and phone number in the README if you are strictly restricting the format. When applying for a job as a job-seeker, the error prompt for the portfolio format says that it should be of the form http(s)://www.website.com/org/etc however it only accepts the format http(s)://www.website.com. The same issue arised while creating a company while signed in as a recruiter.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the README file is very detailed and helps the user to understand the working of the app very well. It could be a little brief or be displayed as bullet points instead of paragraphs to make it easier to read.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>&nbsp;The radio button on the bottom made it easy to switch between roles.&nbsp; An improvement could be recruiters being able to view job applications for a specific job.&nbsp; If they are viewing a job, they should be able to view its applications.&nbsp; It's ok as is in this system, but in a larger system with a lot of applications, a recruiter would want to be able to go from a job to its applications directly.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The UI is very user friendly and intuitive. Navigation through the pages is effortless and very much sticks to the norms of what is considered an intuitive UI. There is hardly any need to go through the readme to understand what the system does as it is very obvious. Also, the readme, although not required to understand how to go about interacting with the system, is very descriptive and covers all the aspects of the system.</p>",,,-1,<p>Readme is well described. But the sample accounts are not working.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>readme file is very detailed. it's easy to see that they spend some time working on it. just still can't log in with the account in readme file on the cloud platform.</p>,,,1,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">I went through spec folder, and found some RSpec&nbsp;tests.

Also this if structure seems reminiscent of Java or C, and could potentially be done in a better way. I do see good use of the sessions_helper.rb file in the project, which I have come to appreciate through the completion of my own team's project. Helper classes can be very useful to return functionality with great coding practices. The models have the good ancestry and relationships set up between models, to allow the sort of functionality needed in the system. The homepage index view file seems to have a lot of embedded ruby code, which I believe is not indicative of good coding practice. I think some of the functionality, such as figuring out which type of user is signed in, could be levied to the controller, where you then use what the controller returns to decide how the view responds. Other than these specific instances, I think the rest of the project is set up in a great way.</p>",,,1,"<p>There looked to be Java/C++ conventions (for example, != """" instead of .blank? or .nil? and if blocks instead of if/unless at end of statement.&nbsp; While not necessarily a coding practice, there was no validation of user access in the controllers, only the views.&nbsp; Also more of a general Git convention, they uploaded things like tmp files that shouldn't be committed.</p>",,,1,"<p>The application is deployed on Heroku and the admin details are provided in the README file and there are some more lines about the application. So no issue in testing the application. The interface is simple and gets the job done.<br />However, that being said, it was difficult to navigate around because the admin could be deleted and thereafter I couldn't test further functionality of the admin. Also, the README says a user can login using gmail and receive notifications using a gmail id. But neither worked for me.</p>",,,-1,"<p>1.

<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>- More comments to explain the code&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The code followed good&nbsp;ruby on rails coding practices. All the code is well organized in models, views, and controllers. The code functionally implements most of the functionality but only some mistakes exist. Overall, the project code was good. Here, are some points which have been improved and which needs to be improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Good Improvements</strong></p>
<p>1) Company Information perfectly organized and automatic assignment of company id.</p>
<p>2) Submittal status has been added in this submission</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Functionality Mistakes</strong></p>
<p>1) Recruiter company information is not displayed for admin.</p>
<p>2) An invalid number of numbers in phone number is accepted.</p>
<p>3) Job not creating for existing companies</p>
<p>4) Job seeker himself can set the application status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) A phone number cannot be viewed by an admin of users in information.</p>
<p>6) A recruiter is able to create same company with all identical details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7) No match between creating an application for a particular job that recruiter has posted. It is implemented as creating an application for any company and not to specific job in a company.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has used standard scaffold generations and have extended it. Standard naming conventions have been followed. However, the models have not been validated thoroughly. For example, there is no check to see if a linkedin&nbsp;profile URL or a portfolio URL is valid. The gender, disability status, veteran status etc.. can take arbitrary values as long as they are less than 255 characters long.</p>",,,-1,<p>The Code on Github seems to follow Ruby and Rails coding practices</p>,,,1,<p>The code has good standards. Logic is present in the views to hide buttons and elements. This can be better implemented using pundit gem.</p>,,,1,"<p>The user interface is mostly easy to use. I liked the use of CSS. However, there are a few things that were out of place. I have listed some of them below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>While applying for a job, the user is expected to enter his current company. This should be auto-populated. Also, there are no drop-downs for fields such as gender. race, disability etc.</li>
<li>While creating a company, the founded field expects a date format. I kept trying to enter just a year initially, and the error message I got was ""Founded can't be empty"". It was only by chance that I figured out that the founded field needed to be a date.</li>
<li>Applying for a job isn't intuitive. There is an option to view all jobs, but there is no way to apply for a job from there. One needs to click on Manage applications, create a new application,&nbsp;<strong>enter a job id,</strong> and then apply. I don't think it is reasonable to expect a job-seeker to remember the job id of the job he's applying to. Also, the job filtering mechanism has not been implemented - one can only search by company id, which is again not very reasonable.</li>
<li>Clicking on ""Home"" takes us to a very generic home page. I think this page should be designed such that it is easy for the current type of user to see his available actions. For example, this page can list all the applications of the current job seeker who's logged in.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Editing a user's profile requires clicking on&nbsp;<strong>Settings,</strong> rather than&nbsp;<strong>Profile.</strong> This isn't particularly intuitive. It might be better to rename the options as&nbsp;<strong>View Profile&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Edit Profile.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The README isn't very helpful apart from telling us how to post a job.</p>",,,1,"<p>The user interface is very elegant&nbsp;and appealing. It was very easy to use and navigate. All the information is perfectly organized but some improvements could make this even better. Like a drop down for existing companies and job id, company id information cannot be remembered by the user.Hence, drop down with existing entries would be helpful. And a drop down for gender, veteran status, and disability status could make it even better. Appropriate comments for the information entered in the comments would be helpful. Like phone number only 10 digits are permitted etc.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team added on the top of the requirements a nice user interface, which helped&nbsp;easy to navigate within the team's web application. However, I'd like to give some suggestions that would add some improvements to their UI:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Adding drop-down lists for&nbsp;Employment Type,&nbsp;Gender,&nbsp;Race,&nbsp;Veteran Status,&nbsp;Disability Status, Size of company.</li>

<p>The team has mentioned that they have used factory design pattern however I think that it doesn't quite qualify. The factory pattern lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate.According to the link for Factory pattern provided in the Wiki, the constructor should be made private so that the factory methods are called based on the type of Review report. However, the class implemented by the team just invokes the constructor with different set of arguments. Using a hash table would save some of the code lines.

So there is no way to test their code or tell if their code is working properly.</p>",,,-1,<p>All features work as intended.&nbsp; It appears that the author has thoroughly tested all test cases.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Code Climate produces several notifications, namely issue with spacing, tabbing, and potential for minor refactoring.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team explains in great detail about the menu items, which is the focus point of the project.

The team has clearly stated the issues that the project aims to solve and also explained them in sufficient detail. The screen captures to show the menu items gives context to the explanation provided.</p>
<p>However, I feel that there is some extra information on the wiki as well. As this is a wiki page for the project,I would suggest putting the information about Test Driven Development and Unit Testing as embedded links or maybe at the end of the document as it is does not serve as an introduction to the project but rather gives a background to the project. I have similar views about the section in the document - Expertiza Environment Setup. Setting up the environment again is not the main function of the project.However I do agree that it helps someone who is completely new to the Expertiza platform</p>",,,1,"<p>wiki for this project is well written and organized. The hierarchic structure almost covered every thing need to be mentioned: There're ""introduction"", ""problem statement"", ""plan of work"", &ldquo;implementation steps&rdquo;, &ldquo;conclusion and learning outcomes&rdquo; and &ldquo;references&rdquo;. But I'd make 2 suggestions:</p>
<p>1. The &rdquo;introduction&ldquo; part is&nbsp;very long and all about&nbsp;explaining what expertiza, TDD and unit testing are, which I think is not necessary. ""introduction"" should focus more on your project&nbsp;rather than something so general.</p>
<p>2. There's no result shown in the write up such as how many coverage percentage they finally got.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The description is so well-organzied and has all required steps.

I really like the images showcasing how to navigate to test the functionality of their code.</p>,,,1,"<p>The authors have given a very detailed introduction to their project.

It does not, however, give much detail into describing edge cases and invalid input scenarios, and how those situations are handled.</p>",,,-1,<p>The test plan is described very well in the wiki. The test plan includes different conditions that they need to test. There is no mention of any edge cases in the testing cases. If there are the authors need to add that in the wiki as well.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. Their test plan is a clear outline for their work. They did not include those pre-conditions in the plan but they did that in their steps.</p>,,,-1,"<p>They got Plan of Work instead of Test Plan which I think is almost the same thing. In this section, they concisely present their plan and it turns to be reasonable and easy to understand. But it just briefly talked about the main steps they've taken and it's too short to cover different-conditions, edge cases, etc.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The test plan was very thorough but missed a lot of edge cases and invalid values. For example, #above and #below don't test cases when there is no above or below values to return.&nbsp; .find_or_create_by_name should also test both cases (find and create) but only one of the cases is tested. .items_for_permissions is a good example of a more thoroughly tested method</p>",,,-1,<p>The test plan in explained in great detail.

But I'm a little confused about the ""expertiza environment setup"" part cuz they didn't include&nbsp;installing bower code in ""setup commands"" which is essential to run expertiza on local host. Also, I didn't find database migration in their setup process.&nbsp;It's a minor problem but I'd recommend making that part complete.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. They explain their work with great details.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes they explained TDD and Unit Testing well. They also explained everything about the model they were testing very thoroughly.</p>,,,-1,"<p style=""text-align: center;"">The write up explains everything that the projects needs to work on. They have mentioned the design pattern they used and why.

They have mentioned the same under ""Testing conditions"". They written test cases for the various functions in the model.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The writeup describes, in detail, the background of each method being tested, the test written for it, and why the test operates the way it does, in context.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the write up does do a good job explaining what the authors did and why the authors did it.&nbsp; Since this project mainly focused around Unit Testing, there wasn't really any ""design patters or principles"" that the team needed to follow.&nbsp; That being said, they did write clean code that followed the Ruby on Rails style guidelines as far as I could tell.&nbsp; One&nbsp;small problem I had with the write up was the amount of information that was presented on Test Driven Development.&nbsp; While I appreciated the section they wrote on Unit testing since it related directly to what they were doing with their project, it seems that including a section on why TDD is good is a bit ironic.&nbsp; I say this because while TDD is good, this is an example of testing after development and not TDD.&nbsp; Because of this, having a large section in the write up that explains TDD seems out of place.&nbsp; I would suggest removing this section.</p>",,,-1,"<p>No writeup link provided in the submission.</p>

They describe their planned implementation, but don't go into project level specifics and actually explaining them going through the plan or how it works. They simply provide the interface by which they will receive these metrics, but not how it will talk specifically to Expertiza.

<ul>
<li>forgetting edge cases</li>
<li>the scope of a few things is inefficient</li>
<li>the code is not DRY enough</li>

By looking at the comments on the pull request I can say that there is a good chance it will be accepted.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It seems like the objectives of the project were not met fully. In addition, as a Mozilla reviewer also pointed out, the code style and readability are not optimal. In addition, the structure of the code (e.g. extracting functions from longer ones) will require attention. Overall I think the team is on the right track and this is a good starting place for a future team to pick up (as long as the code stays readable!).</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team did a good effort to develop the project. The primary purpose of the project has been achieved. however, a lot of the process is manual rather than automated.

I feel some description that they have mentioned in the youtube video could have been added to the readme as well so that the reviewer dooes not have to go through the whole video to understand a part of the project. This could also be done by adding annonations to the video or by mentioning timestamps in the youtube video description for the features the project has. For example you could mention @4:00 part two of the project (screenshot) feature, or something similar.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall, the writeup was good. The one area the team could've done better is the implementation section. As of the time this review was written, the implementation section has two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the process of building the project</li>
<li>the process of running the python script</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;I would've like to have read more about the structure of the python script. This is mainly because looking through code can be a strenuous process.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup is neat.

<p>The write-up just included the project description which was in the project description given initially.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is well written and organized. However, there are some problems in the code after the second round. They are</p>
<p>1) The program code_generation.py did not include comments which makes it difficult to follow the code and takes more time to understand and review.</p>
<p>2) In the program servo_automation_screenshot.py, the entire program is implemented in the main function(Long or Complicated function). Instead, the program could be modularized which makes it easier to maintain and reuse.</p>
<p>The names of functions are appropriate and simple to understand its purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall the code is very readable and quite easy to follow. Variable names don't always follow the naming conventions exactly but they are named in a way that it is clear what their purpose is.</p>
<p>There are a few instances where a try-catch blocks are needed, or some other way of ensuring certain edge cases don't break the program. For example, one of the functions that saves a screenshot to a local directory does not check if the directory exists before trying to write to it. <br /><br />In addition, the code is commented quite well. Functions had headers that explained what they do, and in some instances certain lines had comments that clarified their purpose.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It appears that the team added a few test cases. I was able to observe the presence of various types of exceptions for a good amount of functionalities, so it is apparent that the new functionalities that team implemented were tested in some way. If not, the possible errors were in mind and the appropriate exceptions were created.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Since it is a mozzila project, i dont think coverage is required for it.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>No new tests were added. Even though the project specification didn't state to add tests, it would have been beneficial for the team to add some.</p>",,,-1,<p>Since it is a Mozzila project I feel the test cases were not required as part of this project.</p>,,,-1,<p>Manual testing was explained and everything checks out</p>,,,1,"<p>The team did not add test cases. This is one of the caveats of thier&nbsp;project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the project is satisfied but including the test cases could have increased the coverage and range of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Great. Lots of comments for the conditions.</p>,,,1,"<p>The team's work looks pretty neat with no DRY problems. Every test case is commented. However, the RSpec coding&nbsp;structure is not fully met. According to the provided video&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzkVfaKChSU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=35s which gives a good test structure, every method being tested should begin with 'describe' block, and a condition of the method can be tested in 'context'. For instance, the method #above from menu_item.rb&nbsp;could have been written as: describe '#above' do context 'when&nbsp;an item with parent id'&nbsp; do it ..... end end context 'when an item without parent id' it ..... end end end.&nbsp;</p>

I would urge them to consider how they will test the updates and various improvements they are planning on making. I don't think they are missing much besides that, but perhaps they should put a quick numerical or bulleted outline above the design section that quickly lists all of the changes to be made that they go into detail about later. As a reader, it was sort of difficult to read everything when it was so crammed together. Though, as a counter point they did have nice use of headers to distinguish different parts.

The problem statement and suggested solutions were described in detail. In addition, screenshots of the issues were put in place, which helped provide context and visualize the problem. However, a test plan will need to be added, and it would have been good to include a few mock-ups of proposed changes. Overall, this is a great wiki.</p>",,,1,"<p>I really like how y'all included a lot of information about this project.&nbsp; While the information was great I do wish you had a stronger&nbsp;introduction.&nbsp; It is confusing about what is new (what y'all are going to do) for this project.&nbsp; Also, nothing is included about tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>I like how you explain the reasoning behind fixes as you describe the proposed implemented solutions. It seems that you all have really divided up the tweaks and improvements well, that they seem to be quite modular and all small chunks that are quite manageable, so good job! Overall, i still think it may seem a bit too cluttered and maybe just that small summary of all of the improvements before the design section could help out.</p>",,,1,"<p>The explanations of the changes are excellent. On top of being documented with a problem statement (in those where its necessary) and picture, the specific improvements for the changes are provided as well. I would say the only issue is that some of the suggested changes are in bulleted points, and those lack some of the explanation that other changes have. I would suggest splitting all of the suggested changes into bullet points to increase readability, but to keep the level of detail (or add in cases where needed like in the <strong>Checkbox questions</strong> section).</p>",,,1,"<p>On the add metrics chart section, I think it would be helpful if you would at least show a mock-up to illustrate the type of graph you expect you will produce. That way as a reader, we can understand the certain contribution and how helpful this will end up being. Other than that I think the design looks well constructed. I would perhaps be specific in which files you plan on editing to perhaps get a better look at the specifics, so we understand where you will have to be careful and to ensure you have thought the design through well enough.</p>",,,1,"<p>The designs appear to be sound. There are no apparent code smells, and, while there was a lack of designs/mockups, it is clear that the proposed changes aren't too complicated. However, the team did not indicate which files and classes they are going to change, so it is unclear whether or not unecessary or out of place code is going to be added.</p>",,,1,"<p>The mock-ups provided look good, but what I notice is they seem to essentially all be the same as the ones provided in the requirements document. Where this ok right at the beginning, it doesn't seem to show any editing to indicate your specific contribution. I would urge you to consider showing by some fashion how your contribution will improve expertiza. A simple mock-up is alright, at least something that illustrates each change you plan on making. Also perhaps you should show a UML diagram showing some sort of flow of information that represents what your project aims to do and the problem it aims to solve.</p>",,,1,"<p>The visual aids are used to illustrate the problems and serve their purpose well. However, I would suggest a design mockup to be made either on paper, whiteboard, or wireframing software. These types of pictures will help visualize how the changes will affect the application and allow for reviewers to spot potential problems and suggest changes to the design.</p>",,,1,<p>Several different screenshots really helped convey what changes needed to be made. Maybe a UML diagram or mockup would have worked as well but I think the screenshots made the best since for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>I believe their code looks well written with few DRY problems.

However, since the build never completed, there is no coverage report from which I can tell if the coverage increased or not. The majority of the logic for this project seems to be in the github_data_controller and github_datum model and these two files were extensively covered using tests.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team added two tests, one for the model and for the controller. The tests seem to cover the basic expectations of the project i.e to retrieve the expected data. I would think the coverage would increase, but I am not sure since there is no mention of this. I believe the team could have a few more test cases testing edge cases or scenarios where the values are not retrievable due to a private repository or when a student uses multiple accounts to push commits.</p>",,,1,<p>The team did a great job at this as far as I understand. The testing plan in the wiki page clearly specifies where to look and what to expect which I really liked. The files specified has a new functions and the content in one of the files was not present earlier in the first round of review which is now present. I believe they have done a great job at this.

The team could have looked into creating a detailed video showing the improvement work as expected.</p>",,,1,"<p>As I said earlier team has really put in efforts to improve from the first round and they seem to have added functions as well as improve the code. However, a screenshot of a terminal showing the test cases have passed/failed would have better helped understand for the reviewer.

Results have several graphics on each of the metrics saved, which allows a viewer to understand precisely what their solution did. The part that could have been done better is the testing section, as there is just a single line that only says where the tests are kept. I think for this project the team did a lot of great work on the implementation but not a whole lot to test the routes through which the data flows, which is in a lot of ways the most important aspect.</p>",,,1,"<p>Well the writeup briefly mentions what the project is about and what is the team's approach towards the same.</p>
<p>One suggestion that I would like to give regarding the writeup is that the authors should elaborate a bit more on the Proposed Design and Improvements section.</p>",,,1,"<p>I found the writeup to be not sufficient.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Sample view does give a idea of how the view would be and they have improved from the previous Wiki page and have taken suggestions into consideration, I would remove the code part from the wiki.</p>",,,1,"<p>The write up has improved in comparision to the first review , but in totality more information could be added , example the test sub section is written in a line , probabily more description would have been better</p>",,,1,"<p>The write-up looks complete and informs the reader about what the functionality does. The use of images to explain things done and achieved is helpful as it's more powerful than words. They have improved it significantly since the first review. They could add more information in the testing section about what tests were made and the results. But overall, job well done.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup has significantly improved for sure. They have added an improvements section which shows what they did in this round. They have also added screenshots of their outcome which I really liked. However as I suggested earlier, I would put&nbsp;more information about whether the test cases are passing or not. If they are failing then reviewers might be able to help solve the issue</p>",,,1,"<p>I do not think this code is ready to be deployed mainly because of the staggering amount of code climate issues and the fact that the build failed. I think they did a great job in implementing such a useful feature, but there are hardly any tests done to validate that this won't break any pre-existing code. I think that maybe this could be used by a future team and built upon by fixing said issues and adding tests, and after that teams contribution could certainly be deployed to the production server.</p>",,,1,<p>The code should be only deployed to the production server when all the issues suggested by Code Climate are fixed and also there was an error because of which the build could not complete.

<p>The documentation and steps a reviewer should perform to get to the specific part of the code was not there.</p>
<p>So, apart from the snapshots, it was tough for me to find out the exact changes in the code made by the contributor.</p>",,,1,<p>The Travis build failed and there 87 code climate issues to be fixed.

So the code is not ready to be pushed onto production.<br /><br /></p>,,,1,"<p>I would keep the code out of deployment until all the test cases have been met, which could be a different project as there are many aspects to be considered and many things will be looked into, even though the team has done a good job, but due to lack of test cases and more corner cases needed it would be better to keep this out of deployment.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, I think the code in terms of functionality based on the writeup and images is ready to be deployed in production and the team has put in a good effort. However I have two big concerns - one needs to manually test it to see if it's working as the team describes it does. Second, there could be more test cases covering different scenarios. But this could be added as a future responsibility to a different team. In terms of use case, I believe it would be helpful to the instructors in assigning a grade.</p>",,,1,"<p>Apart from the issue that the Travis CI build is failing, they have produced a neat and understandable code. If they can overcome the issue that would be really great. I would add more comments in case if this project will be continued by members who have not worked on this. Even if the same team or same members are continuing the project, it is always a good idea to add comments for better readability and understanding of code.</p>",,,1,"<p>The build did not pass and there are a multitude, about 90 issues with Code Climate.

I further investigated on why it is not passing and found that they are trying to run install commands in deployment which seems to be the major issue why the build is not passing. This issue can be solved either by finding another way to resolve dependencies before the deployment mode. I would first search what would be the ideal way to install dependencies and if not, ask mentors on how to solve this. This does not seem to be a big deal as fas as the code is concerned, there are no issues there.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Ultimately I like the idea behind the UML diagram. It seems to me that it is meant to enable the reader to understand the importance of the&nbsp;<em>users_controller</em> and why it is important to create these integration tests. This controller seems to enable new users to sign up and then to be approved by an instructor, which is quite pivotal to Expertiza. Perhaps before next submission you could come up with a few graphics as to the testing interface and how these integration tests will go through and ensure correct operation of the controller. Other than though, i think the UML is quite well made and easy to understand!</p>",,,-1,<p>The design wiki is completed. A lot of related pictures are shown there which introduces what they want to do very well.</p>,,,1,"<p>The authors have not included a testing plan in the document. The major focus of the project is on making a lot of changes to the UI.

<p>Testplan is not mentioned anywhere in the document. Please add test plan that Adding bulleted point wherever necessary could have improved the readability of the content.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design doc is almost complete.

The design which the team proposes to solve this issue has also been explained thoroughly. However, the test plan section is missing . They haven't mentioned anything about testing their proposed design.</p>
<p>Also this team has mentioned the changes that they need to make in detail but have not mentioned the files that needs to be changed. This would make it easier for the reader to gauge these changes and see if they are accurate or not.</p>
<p>Thus, I would suggest to add a test plan explaining in detail the proposed testing methodology and include the files to be changed with a brief explanation of changes in each file.</p>",,,-1,<p>Very thorough with the description of the purpose and design. The only thing missing is any plans for testing.</p>,,,1,"<p>The design doc is very well written and is easy to follow.

Apart from that, the authors have done a flawless job.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have done a great job explaining the intent of the project. The screenshots and descriptions are very helpful. The only improvement I can suggest is to segregate the sections properly. At the moment, the ""present scenario"" and ""proposed implementation"" are mixed up. The authors need to separate these into different sections.</p>
<p>Secondly, the proposed implementation should also contain details of the application files (views/models etc) that needs changing.</p>
<p>Third, the authors need to add a ""Test Plan"" section and describe the same.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document provides in depth details about the current issues and things to be implemented which is good. They make use of images to good effect. The only issue I see is that they are missing a few key sessions. Consider thinking forward and adding test plans, as well as setting up a git fork that you'll be working on and adding it as necessary external links.</p>",,,-1,<p>The Design document does incorporate all of the functionality they are supposed to implement as per the requirements.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required.</p>",,,-1,"<p>After checking the specification provided for the project, it can be observed that the authors' proposed design has incorporated all of the required functionality and does not appear to have missed any part.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the doc incorporates all the functionality required.</p>
<p>They have tried to implement all the functionalities to their best</p>",,,-1,"<p>Looks like the project has lot of changes to be made in the system and the team has carefully noted them and included in the design document.

<p>Just one suggestion , the project requirement states that in the review report , the course name and the student name must be shown as correctly it does not display that. This part has not been clearly stated in the doc but rather implied.

The team has provided a highly detailed view of what the project is and what should be expected of it.</p>",,,1,<p>Yes. The authors have captured all the functionality mentioned in the project requirements. They have also done a good job explaining the same in their documentation. They could improve this by separating their documentation into mode logical sections than it is now.</p>,,,-1,"<p>As far the functionality goes, the design doc covers it and it seems to include all details no matter how small. I couldn't find anything that is missing based on the requirement spec. So, well done!</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes! Everything seems to be included.&nbsp; I like how you included screenshots just like in the spec of the projects.&nbsp; Helps convey info better!</p>,,,-1,<p>The wiki introduces the functionality very well.

So I feel there can be certain additions to the explanations that describe how the proposed changes will be implemented.</p>

The changes mentioned could be understood by anyone who doesn't have any prior knowledge on the system. Good work team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important part is that they have explained everything in detail with all the necessary supporting examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes made in the Review Summary Page like changes in Header, where the team is trying to figure out fixing whitespace is not clear to me. This could have been explained well.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author has proposed some pretty concrete changes in the this doc. All these changes address the requirements as stated in the project problem statement. The idea of color coding in the review report is great and would make the job of the instructor easier. The idea of propagating the change in background color after sorting is great. This is not explicitly mentioned in the problem but rather have been spun up by the team to add convenience. This is really good.</p>
<p>However , I would suggest that , instead of just stating your plan of action , the team should have given a brief explanation of the implementation of these proposed ideas for the reviewer to judge. Including the files required to be edited would also be great and increase the understanding of the implementation that the team has in mind.</p>
<p>Adding a brief explanation of the implementation and including a list of files in which the proposed changes have been made would be really helpful for the reviewers.</p>",,,-1,<p>All of the changes were well explained.&nbsp; More details about exactly what needs to change will probably be added as they get into the code more.</p>,,,-1,<p>The changes that the authors have proposed are easy to understand.

It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly. The only thing I felt inadequate was that there's no mention about the potential files and/or functions they would have to change to implement the requirements. Including these give a feel that the team has been thorough and have a solid foundation to work on.</p>,,,1,<p>Explanation of each change is very good and detail - I really like the screenshots.&nbsp; I do think you need a better introduction explaining things.&nbsp; Just go into a little more detail about what expertiza is and what you're trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The wiki doesn't introduce how to achieve all the functionality in detail. But some of them are good.</p>,,,-1,"<p>As I mentioned earlier, for all the proposed changes the authors have not mentioned what files will need modification and what files may be added so I cannot make a comment about the problems mentioned in the question.</p>",,,1,"<p>I did not find a section where the classes, models, controllers or views that would be impacted were listed.</p>
<p>They could have listed it in a separate section so that they could have been visible properly</p>",,,-1,"<p>They didn't explain their changes much at all. They gave score formula tables, but didn't say how they'd be used. The ""planned approach"" section is mostly just a list of requirements a second time.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a testing plan, but it's not fleshed out in enough detail to be used. It's just ""We'll make sure we meet the requirements"" but phrased as test cases.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Project Purpose: The purpose of the project has been clearly explained in detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Design: They have provided appropriate links and diagrams to justify the solutions have been provided.</p>
<p>Testing Plan: The test cases have been included in the design doc&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design doc. has included the required section mentioned in the question. Although I suppose the authors could elaborate more on certain aspects like planned approach, files changed, etc. Overall the team has done a good job but the document could have been more thorough if it included more details about the approach.</p>
<p>Suggestion: If possible, provide detailed explanation of what you plan to do and how you intend to achieve that.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think the design doc is complete and has all the important part. It also proposed three ways to calculate&nbsp;composite self-/peer-review grades, which shows that they did a good amount of research for this project. Nice job.</p>
<p>One minor thing is that I don't really understand the purpose of this project. I know it is to judge the difference between self review and peer review. But what is it for? Is this in some way helping students understanding more about their work?</p>",,,1,"<p>What the team has mentioned is sufficient.The introduction is well framed. I feel that the approach can be explained in greater detail. The team has elaborated on one part of the design that is score formulas but haven't explained about how they will address the other design issues. For eg you can elaborate on the design steps:-</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Remove the ability to see peer reviews before self reviews-</strong>Does this mean that the student won't be graded till he submits a self review or he just won't be able to view it.</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0.1em;""><strong>Create/find a function to link peer and self review scores -</strong> Which controller will be responsible for this? Which files will be modified or created for implementing this function.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also the step in the design approach <strong>""Implement function in a method that will be used when a self review is submitted"" </strong>is rather vague. The terms function and method are used ambiguously. I would suggest elaborating on what the function will include and what it will achieve and where it will be written.</p>
<p>If writing is too much of a hassle, you can just include a simple UML diagram/Flow chart explaining the design steps.</p>
<p>There is just a title for Files changed and nothing has been written under that section</p>",,,1,<p>The files to be changed are not provided by the authors. It would have been a good idea to add that part.</p>,,,1,"<p>The document has all the sections as mentioned in the question. The authors have done good job. However, the planned approach section just includes the bullet points of the implementation which is planned.It is almost restating what is included in the problem statement. It would have been a lot better if this team would have explained their approach and included the files which requires to be changed in order to realize this solution.</p>
<p>I suggest to include a brief explanation of the implementation. Also consider including a UML or flowcharts to explain the steps and the data flow involved in the implementation. This increases the clarity of the document and the readers will be able to understand it seamlessly.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors did a pretty good job in showing the heat maps for different scoring strategies, and comparing them .&nbsp;</p>

All these problems are addressed and solution has been proposed for it. However, this document is lacking in terms of details regarding the implementation.</p>
<p>Also the problem statement states that the authors have freedom in deciding how these scores are displayed and how they are computed. The authors have made use of this has have considered several methods for implementation and included all of them in the doc.</p>",,,1,<p>Yes the design document covers a lot of the functionality that is required from the project.

They have done a good job considering the options for Score calculations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion: In the planned approach section you have mentioned what needs to be done. If possible, you can add some explanation about how you intend to do it i.e. in terms of the files that will need modification and something on the code level. This will make the document will be more complete.</p>",,,1,"<p>They didn't explain their changes much at all. They gave score formula tables, but didn't say how they'd be used.

<li>Some of the sections are repeated. For eg:- The Introduction and Problem statement and Planned Approach sections are pretty similar. For eg:"" Ensure that users cannot view peer reviews until they complete their self review"" and""&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">Remove ability to see peer reviews before submitting a self review"" state the same thing.&nbsp;</span></li>

The authors should have explained the plan for the changes and the result of those in detail.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>&nbsp;The authors have covered all the problems mentioned in the problem statement and have proposed a solution. However, they have only stated bullet points or goals that they intend to implement but they have not specified the implementation of their plan of action. They haven't explained how they intend to implement this. &nbsp;For example - In the document , the authors have said, they need to find or include a function to merge the peer review and self scores in some way. They haven't specified which controller this method would belong to and what exact functionality they need to implement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also , the test plan provided by this team seems to cover all the cases. However , they have just added bullet points. I think they should provide a brief explanation of the test scenarios which would make it easier for the reviewers to understand snd help them analyze whether more scenarios can be thought of. This would improve the test plan of this team.</p>
<p>The authors have provided 4 possible functions for calculating the self reviews and discussed their drawbacks and merits. However, they haven't mentioned, which they have finalized. I would suggest to include a comparative study of the methods and which one was finalized including the reasons for it.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>They have given an exemplar matrix showing the self review scores and have shown different formulas applied to this matrix. This looks like a very good description of the project and thus makes the description helpful. They have also provided us with a comparison of the different formulas which is also helpful. They could mention the files that are going to be affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The explanation provided is good, but they could have explained the four score formulas in more detail. They could have explained each approach for better understanding. They could have stated pros and cons of each formulas and given which way they think is the most suitable in this case.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The&nbsp;team has done an excellent job explaining both the scope of their project, as well as the steps they plan on taking to completing their project.&nbsp; One area that could use a little improvement is the ""Testing"" portion.&nbsp; While the team has given some excellent scenarios to test, I feel as though there might be some cases that they are missing.&nbsp; For instance, the team is testing to make sure that ""Peer reviewers cannot be viewed before a self review is completed"".&nbsp; After testing this though, they do not test to make sure that a peer reviews can be viewed after a self review has been completed.&nbsp; I would also suggest adding some more explanation on how they plan on testing the project.&nbsp; Other then that though, great job!</p>",,,1,"<p>1) It has not been mentioned which files they are planning to modify. So it is hard to follow what method they are targeting.</p>
<p>2) New design doesn't seem to be ""smelly"", as they are trying to use new approach.</p>
<p>3) Gems could be used for rendering the views which they are trying to do in their fourth approach.&nbsp;</p>

However, based on the goals , I can comment that the function they are to implement seems a little complex. So here a few points to keep in mind while implementing.</p>
<p>1) Follow the DRY principle. If the code is getting repeated at any point, extract it into separate functions.</p>
<p>2) Use descriptive variable names which makes it easier to keep a track of the functionality implemented by the function.</p>
<p>3) Use appropriate design patterns to write reliable code.</p>

These gave a rough idea of how the calculations work.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Apart from the score calculations, you can include screenshots of the view UI where you plan to make changes. Eg. The project wants the user to see the self review scores juxtaposed with peer review scores. So you could provide a screenshot which depicts the current scenario and then explain what changes you intend to make and how it will be different from the current scenario. Screenshots like these will help the reviewer get a visual idea of the changes that the project will provide to the existing application.</p>",,,1,"<p>Y'all used conditional formatting in Excel, y'all rule.

The graph is quite helpful.</p>",,,-1,"<p>They have a good explanation as to the problem statement and then go into showing a nice UML diagram which represents the usecases of their solution. I think this is good because UML diagrams are great to model systems and flow of information or data.

Use Case diagram is very useful in this situation especially since there are multiple contexts that are used such as the difference between a student and instructor and the operations they are allowed to perform. I think this has all the necessary sections to achieve full points. I would recommend better formatting for the Test plan section instead of a numbered list, but I do not think that this alone should cost you any points. You could achieve this by making a table or using the wiki formatting syntax to make it appear cleaner.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Extra information : it has been specifically written not to write about expertiza</p>
<p>All the components required ie Introduction, plan of implementation and Test plan has been included.</p>
<p>One missing component here is classes affected</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The description is complete.&nbsp; The required sections are present and the use of diagrams and screenshots provide good visual insights into what will be implemented. There could be more detail about the database tables.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team has mentioned the project purpose , the project design and proposed solution along with the testing plan. They have also mentioned the work that was done in the previous implementation of the project.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design document provides in depth details about the current issues and things to be implemented which is good. They make use of images to good effect. The only issue I see is that they are missing a few key sections. I see that the views affected are mentioned, however consider adding the controllers and methods that would be added/changed. Also, there is redundant information on what Expertiza is whereas it was mentioned not to include these details.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes they did incorporate all functionality that was required of them as per the assignment criteria.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. It includes all the required functionality.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design seems to have all the required functionality.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design incorporates the functionality which the team has stated in their design doc as they are improving on the previous implementation of the design. These changes aren't fully listed in the above stated link.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, in Implementation Plan they&nbsp;covered all the required functionalities in detail and gave descriptive illustrations on their implementation plans. Also they made an awesome diagram showing usecase. Good job! Maybe their Test Plan looks&nbsp;a little bit simple, but I believe they will add more stuffs as their project progresses. And if so, I'd suggest to include the test results (like coverage) in Test Plan.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Addresses the problem statement directly, and&nbsp;provides their solutions from a design perspective. I think that if the design is implemented it will achieve full points. Each section has an associated visualization and explanation.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design documents appears to be covering all the functionality, they have mentioned the changes in views according to each sub topic which is a nice thing.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes the design discusses about the functionality which is required from this project and have uploaded images of how the view will look like when the functionalities will be implemented.</p>,,,-1,"<p>As far as the functionality goes, the design doc covers it and it seems to include all details no matter how small. I couldn't find anything that is missing based on the requirement spec. So, well done!</p>",,,-1,"<p>They mention almost all the functions, creation, assignment and approval. however seems they miss one requirement, when instructor try to create new badge, he/she should be able to upload the image. i didn't see the uploading part in their wiki.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>They have a good explanation about their planned implementations, but they dont explain why they will do this or why they will do that. They do show a lot of pictures of mock-up UI changes, which is very good because in this case it makes it almost self explanatory.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Overall, the proposed changes are well explained to me. Well done. However, the part where it mentions ""Approval of badges by instructor"" is not so clear me. It introduces a concept ""student-suggested badges"". I don't know where and how a student could suggest a badge for certain submission for a assignment. Is it about the badges assigned to the teammates?</p>",,,-1,<p>The explanations are easy to follow as they are supplemented by screenshots too.</p>,,,-1,<p>Almost all of the issues has a pictoral description to elucidate the point.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>All the explanations of their changes are well-written and easy to follow. They explained the previous related implementation, illustrate all to-be-done's in detail and split them into several reasonable steps in their Implementation Plan.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I think the explanations are easy to understand, and with the addition of visualizations, I think this only adds to the effectiveness of the design document. I think that your explanation should not rely too heavily on the visualization where possibly. Try to add more depth to the explanation if possible because you cannot always count on someone understanding your&nbsp;screen mock-ups.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The changes have sufficient explanations and diagrams to support those functionality. they are easy to follow and provide good explanation in general.</p>
<p>The overall implementation is divided in sub topics and each one has view files associated mentioned, it would be better to have controllers mentioned but with diagrams and all given the explanation is good enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>The restatement and expansion of the requirements from the description has a good flow and describes the&nbsp;proposed changes well.&nbsp; Consider reviewing and updating the Use Case Diagram arrows.</p>,,,1,<p>The explanations given are good and have good explanation for each of the features that are going to be implemented. The explanations however could be more detailed. The authors could mention the alternatives that the authors decided upon or the different design decisions that the authors are going to take.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The document covers the changes that the team will be making and seems to know how they'll be tackling them. It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly. It seems like it is a good functionality to add.</p>,,,-1,<p>they explained how they would realize the goal in details. they introduced the file in origin expertiza environment which need to be modified in their project.</p>,,,-1,"<p>For the scope of their project, I think their planned implementation looks pretty good. They just need to be able to coordinate the adding of all of those selections to different views and control their actions. I think any implementation could make the code ""smelly"", but they should be careful to not put too much code into the views. It does seem that it may be better for them to consider even extra implementation since modifying a few views seems like a fairly narrow scope, but overall their ideas seem logical and coherent.</p>",,,-1,<p>I think the designs would not cause any of the problems mentioned above.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The above listed problems do not exist with the design. The design seems clean, as seen from the multiple screenshots posted. I don't think the design can be simplified further. I think all the changes they have proposed are necessary.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors haven't stated any code changes as of now.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Their goal is to extend badging functionality and they will mainly add 4 new functionalities about badging, so I think they may increase the response time but it's inevitable. For example, the functionality that students are entitled to assign badges may slightly increase the time of loading pages.</p>",,,1,"<p>For the most part, the design looks good. The only thing that is missing is the UML diagrams or some model of the code that will be modified. I cannot check if the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class because I do not know anything about the code. However, aside from that issue, everything looks great! You tell us what files you are modifying on the front-end, but not on the back end with the database, which I imagine would be the more challenging portion. Please include that in the next iteration.</p>",,,1,"<p>In some cases it is mentioned which files would be changed but they are only related to view, it would have been beneficial to have included changes in controller as well.</p>
<p>In ""assignment of good reviewer"" its very difficult to just know a column by icon, usually if the space is very small it makes sense to have icon, but in this case it would be better to have written text.</p>",,,1,"<p>Though the files that will be changed are mentioned, a high-level overview of what code changes need to be made to these files is not given. It is suggested that this section be added.</p>",,,1,"<p>Some more effort should be expended on the design. There can be a section explaining the different designs that the team/ authors came across while&nbsp;deciding on the one they are going with, these could be explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The changes proposed are mostly to be implemented on the View side and hence I don't think there is anything too complicated or something that could increase the response time of the system. The team has mostly figured out as to where the changes need to be made. However, knowing what controller changes would be made would be helpful to know as to whether it would be efficient. Also, make sure the icons used are open source and do not have any copyright infringement associated.</p>",,,-1,"<p>i didn't see anything that going to be a problem in their right now plan. But one thing they might need to pay attention is when they modified the origin files, they should avoid collision with other related files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The UML diagram shows pretty well the exchange of data. It illustrates how instructors control creating and assigning badges, viewing badges assigned to students and approving badges. Then students can assign badges and view the badges they have received. Also their other diagrams show pretty clearly how they plan on updating the UI to enable these implementations.</p>",,,-1,<p>All the diagrams are helpful in making me understand the project.</p>,,,1,"<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Use case diagram provided.</p>
<p>- Multiple screenshots added for each part.</p>
<p>- In each screenshot, whatever is to be added is marked and mentioned.</p>
<p>- None of the above listed problems exist with the visual aids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>- Add UML diagram.</p>",,,1,"<p>The ""approval of badges"" should have been presented with an image to get an idea what and how the changes are to be reflected.</p>",,,1,"<p>They have made a cool usecase diagram which I think is very helpful for readers to understand the newly-added expertiza badging structure. But I guess there's a little problem with this diagram: ""View badges received"" should read data from the database instead of writing data to the database, so I think the arrow is backwards. Also, I'd mention a little advice even though it wasn't mentioned in the requirements:&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be better if they could illustrate (maybe not in this diagram) what other roles can do with badging (such as admin) rather than just instructor and student.</p>",,,1,"<p>Use of mock-ups is excellent, and are necessary. I think the explanations could be slightly improved, but I addressed this in previous feedback. The UMLs need to be added as well however I do get a solid understanding of what the authors want to do with the code even though I do not know exactly what parts of the code they will modify.</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall the visual aids provided give a good idea of where the changes would be and what the changes would be.</p>
<p>The user case diagram is bit confusing.</p>
<p>It would have been much better to compare the current expected functionality view and the use case diagram with the previous implementation, and write about why this change is needed&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The edited screenshots provide useful visuals of the proposed changes.&nbsp; As mentioned before, please consider reviewing and updating the use case diagram arrows.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have uploaded screenshots and&nbsp; UML diagrams explaining the project .&nbsp; The screenshots are very helpful as they reveal how the end product will look like&nbsp;. The UML diagram looks complete for the required project and shows the different use cases of the system that is going to be designed.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The UML diagrams are helpful and they have explained it with the use of mockups pretty well and hence I don't feel the need for further details regarding the flow they would take. The images convey what the current system is like. They also have some images depicting how it would look after the changes.</p>,,,-1,"<p>they use a diagram to show how will their project work, that's pretty good for reader to understand the project purpose. Also, they use&nbsp;some images to show what the website looks like at the end of this project.</p>",,,-1,"<p>They have explained the changes, but it was not listed in a concise list, instead its spread entirely over the whole wiki.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I don't see where in the wiki which explains how you designed it, instead it explains different components of a badge and they work.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Clearly explains how this badge system works, but not sure how your going to implement it.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I like the user case block diagram, it was very descriptive on what users access what objects on expertiza, as well as how the UI will look like when its implemented.</p>",,,-1,<p>Your testing plan is well developed for the TDD methodology. Checking if you can save a badge under different criterias.</p>,,,1,<p>I am not sure if implementation doubts should be part of the design doc? maybe they should just meet with their mentor to solve those doubts.</p>,,,-1,<p>The documentation is quite thorough and provides all the required information for the reader to understand what the project is about and how the team will approach the problem statement. Overall the team has a done a good job.</p>,,,-1,"<p>There aren't any missing sections, I don't think.</p>
<p>The problems I have with the sections that are there are well explained in other questions in this review.</p>
<p>I do think that basically everything should include more details, though, especially the diagram.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design doc is complete. All the important parts are present.</p>
<p>The minor concern about this new feature is that I am afraid that specific dividing labor among teammates would harm the cooperation.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document is well presented, but I felt that the introduction part could have been written in points , because it is the most important part of the project and if it is written in points, the reader can have an overall understanding of the scope quickly</p>",,,1,"<p>I might include a bit more information in your proposed implementation block. Currently as a dense list of steps its a bit hard to grasp what goal each step has, if you expand for a sentence or two on each one I think it would be perfect. Overall, great job on this, the write up flows well and is intuitive.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The team's wiki seems to be written after they have fully&nbsp;understand the goals of the project and I think they almost got everything needed in their wiki. They got Overview, diagram, Proposed Implementation, Test Plan which is good. But I'd mention that Test Plan is kind of brief. They just wrote what need to be tested, so I'd recommend to include more information about testing such as the to-be-tested&nbsp;files, to-be-created Rspec test files and brief descriptions of to-be-tested methods.</p>",,,1,"<p>the Document appears complete</p>
<p>in the proposed implementation: i do have doubt regarding what if one&nbsp;student&nbsp;is doing multiple things&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the files to be modified, it would have been better to include what changes should there be in each file, would give better idea as to why these files need to be modified.</p>
<p>Test plan should be more elaborate: testing before submitting project all the students should have some role</p>
<p>In the new files section rather then mentioning duties table, It would have been better to write about migration script and specify the columns and their data types</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Very thorough, covers each area that the team has worked on, the results of those changes, and the reasoning behind them. I think improvement can be made by updating 2 areas here, the conclusion includes a link to the future subsequent steps that the team hopes to implement, I would take this out and put it in its own ""future work"" section. Then you can expand upon the steps more and describe why this would improve performance. The second thing is the testing of the webpages. I see you have tested with slither.io and report some very slight improvements, but have you tried any other sites? Maybe report on speed up or slow down of a regular site that doesn't contain 2000+ canvases.</p>",,,1,"<p>Project Purpose :It has been clearly explained what exactly the purpose of the project is.</p>

Everything important is mentioned and described. The team has also added all the necessary links, which some of them serve as illustrations.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design doc is mostly complete. The project purpose is clearly stated. The fact that the ""Initial Steps"" and ""Subsequent Steps"" were listed out was nice. Project Design was mostly stated. However, most of the doc seems to pertain to the ""Initial Steps."" And since the pull request was accepted on 4/2, it seems like not much about the document was changed to include the seconds part of the project. The report had a testing plan, but it also seems like this was for the first part of the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think all sections are there, and complete. The test plan section could be a bit more in-depth&nbsp;than just describing one test that you perform for performance.

<p>The details present under implementation help in giving a better understanding</p>",,,1,"<p>You included all necessary parts (purpose, design, testing).&nbsp; I really like how you included all of the background on servo.&nbsp; While people who are doing mozilla project might understand I doubt anyone else would unless it was added.

However it is a little brief and mostly only includes hand drawn pictures of the potential results and thus is difficult to follow at some places. I would suggest to explain how the proposed changes are to be implemented in a little detail. This increases the ability of the reviewers to understand the ideas proposed by this team.\</p>
<p>Also i suggest to explain the problem statement in detail and not just state it. It makes it easier to understand.</p>",,,-1,<p>The doc seems incomplete as they have not explained the design as well as the testing plan for the project. The purpose of the project is clear but they lack information</p>,,,1,"<p>The team has written work to be done in a good way They have even put in&nbsp; hand drawings which was impressive, But i was not able to find and testing plan in the document&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The document actually looks very thorough and it seems they have considered what they need to do very well. They have included an incredibly thorough description of each method that will be tested thoroughly, the fact that they aim to have &gt; 90% coverage, and an individual testing plan for nearly every method. I think maybe less explanation of each method might be better, but that could just be personal preference. Otherwise it looks great!</p>",,,-1,<p>They have included project purpose and listed out the problems and how they are going to solve them.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Project purpose - problem statement is clear.</p>
<p>- Project design -&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Test plan is very details for every method.</p>",,,1,"<p>This design document is basically almost finished. Everything in it looks complete and well documented. The only issue I have is that you should create a section called problem statement instead of putting it in the intro. This is a minor organizational issue, and when fixed will merit full credit for sure.</p>",,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;Reference kept blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The design document appears to complete with all the files associated mentioned&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked that they have considered each method and what functionality they would test in that</p>",,,1,"<p>They have covered almost everything, including problem description, methods description, and detailed testing plans. It would better if they can include some background information about Expertiza. In fact, most Expertiza groups did not. But not everyone has the background information. While we are also working on Expertiza, Q suggests us to include the information.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document looks to have all relevant details about what the team has set out to achieve. They have mentioned all details about the files they are concerned which is good. Most teams seem to miss out on this important detail. Since this is a testing project, they have quite a few tests about how they would test the various methods. You could consider setting up a git fork that you'll be working on and adding it as necessary external links.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a good job planning out their course of action for their project.&nbsp; The Test Plan does a good job covering the over all scope of the project.&nbsp; I like how the team has described what each method that needs to be tested does, and then goes on to give an example of how they will test that method.&nbsp; One area that could be improved is edge cases.&nbsp; I did not see any reference to them at all.&nbsp; This could be due to there not being any, but it would be helpful if you touched on that just a bit.&nbsp; Over all good job!</p>",,,-1,<p>Very detailed description of what exactly they plan to do.</p>,,,-1,<p>Design doc is very extensive and complete.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Functionality is defined as simply creating the integration tests, which I can see is heavily documented already. I really like the incredible detail you all go into to explain your plan for each method RSpec test.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, since this is only a test project, all they need to do is to test the controller and it has been described in the document.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. The design incorporates all of the functionality required.</p>,,,1,"<p>Discusses all possible branches of the test file at length and lists out all used classes. Very well documented, and based on the problem statement I think that if the authors implement the functionality as stated in the wiki they will earn full credit on the assignment portion as well.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design document has mention of all the methods and classes associated one would test</p>
<p>Its good to see all the components present, they have done a good job in designing the document&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. They have incorporated all methods.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The design doc covers the testing details and it seems to include all details on the methods they would test. I couldn't find anything that is missing based on the requirement spec. So, well done!</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a good job covering all of the required points in the the final project description.&nbsp; The description required that the team create a new file named ""users_controller_spec.rb"" which they have&nbsp;described in their project design document. &nbsp; It also states that the team does not need to test private or protected methods, but needed to achieve at a minimum, 90% path coverage.&nbsp; The team did a good job covering this in their design document as well.&nbsp; All in all the team has done a good job incorporating all of the functionality required into their design doc.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Laid out all the methods that need to be tested and provided a ""it"" statement for each test they plan to implement</p>",,,-1,"<p>Design seems to incorporate all of the required functionality, including testing all methods and many edge cases.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Seeing as everything they are adding is new, I can't see much problem with this. I like how they have already included the context descriptions each test will look into.</p>",,,-1,<p>They have shown&nbsp;that how they are going to test each method that needs to be tested and it's easy to understand.</p>,,,-1,<p>Each method is explained clearly. It is very easy to follow.</p>,,,-1,<p>I think the Test-Plan was very well done and everything is easy to follow. One small suggestion to make is to resize the photo. It is too large to fit on the wiki and is a bit cumbersome to deal with.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>Being a Testing project, there wont be any changes but additions to test cases, each of their test cases has a well defined explanation of why this test case might be required.</p>
<p>Based on the number of test cases and functionality they will be testing it can be clearly seen that this will help in improving the over all test coverage</p>",,,-1,"<p>They have proposed their detailed plan very early, which shows they have a clear idea about the code.</p>",,,1,"<p>While the explanation of methods and tables is complete, this section may be better exemplified by using an ERD for the tables and UML diagram for the methods.&nbsp; The same is true for the test plan.&nbsp; For example, test 10 could be drawn out with decision diagrams to show the flow of execution and error/pass conditions.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Since this is a testing project, the document seems to cover the changes what the team will be implementing and what test cases would be written out. It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a really good job explaining what each method they will test does.&nbsp; They have also given the RSPEC test case headers that they will be using to test each method.&nbsp; While this does a pretty good job explaining what will be tested, it might help to add a short explanation for each test.&nbsp; For instance, under the ""Create"" method, one of the described tests states, ""Is this the name new?&nbsp; If yes, good.&nbsp; Otherwise, register the user by email address""&nbsp; This is a bit confusing to me, as I don't fully understand what is going on.&nbsp; It seems to be saying if the name is new, then don't register a new users, but this seems contradictory to the idea of a ""create"" method? Because of this, it would be nice to have some added explanation attached to each test.&nbsp; Other then that though, everything looks good!</p>",,,-1,<p>Very straightforward explanation.</p>,,,-1,<p>Explanations are thorough and very detailed.</p>,,,1,"<p>It looks they are inspecting the correct class as their project works around the&nbsp;<em>users_controller.rb</em> controller. I think at this point I would ensure you be careful when generating your tests and try to use a DRY approach. I found that correct use of a before(:each) block can truly make code look pretty and less cluttered with the same allow statements. Overall the thought put into creating the test definitely seems sound, I would just look through to ensure you are covering most avenues to acquire that 90% coverage. Otherwise great work so far on the design!</p>",,,-1,<p>The above mentioned problems do not exist.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Methods are added to the appropriate classes, and I think that most of the other points for this section can be disregarded for a test class. (i.e. runtime does not matter too much for tests unless they are significantly&nbsp;longer, but this does not appear to be the case for this team).</p>",,,1,"<p>There is no need to have design proposition as this is a test project, the test plan is good and doesnt appear to be smelly and doesnt over complicate the things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't change anything here, all the right classes and methods have been taken into consideration and the right classes and associated classes have been targeted for testing.</p>
<p>Good job here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>In fact, it is too early to check. Although they have a detailed test plan, they have not covered any code information yet. So do other groups.</p>",,,-1,<p>The group has the right approach in stating the tables and methods that deal with the users controller and defining the test plan to test the methods.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Since this is not a design requirement, there seems to be no reason to include any design proposition. But the test proposition seems to be adequate and should improve the system rather than decreasing any response time. Everything good here.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design appears to be very sound.&nbsp; Since the team is just testing one file, they only need to edit/create one test file and their design document reflects this.&nbsp; Great job.</p>",,,-1,<p>Design is solid. Tests all seem reasonable.</p>,,,-1,<p>The tests appear to be thorough and sound.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>I wonder if they could build UML diagrams for test plan?</p>,,,1,"<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Flow chart added to explain the methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above mentioned problems do not exist. This project does not seem to require UML diagrams or mockups.</p>",,,1,"<p>Diagram of the flow of the code is used appropriately. I am not sure that a UML is necessary for this project since it is just a test class. Of course, it would not hurt to include one to help represent the portion of the system under test, but I do not think it merits a significant loss of points.</p>",,,1,"<p>They have included diagrams, and adequate information can be extracted from the diagram, UML and other diagrams wont be needed in this case as it is a testing project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is a good enough depiction of the entire test plan and a lot of aspects have been taken into consideration.</p>",,,-1,"<p>They use a diagram to illustrate the new method, which is really helpful.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Adding more diagrams/visuals would be helpful, especially in the test plan section.</p>",,,1,<p>They have a diagram depicting the current flow for the creation of the users which is helpful. However I do not think any diagram could be expected of testing projects. You could include some screen mockups of when appropriate error messages should occur.</p>,,,-1,<p>The visual aids that are included in the write up are very helpful in understanding the project scope and design.</p>,,,-1,<p>The flow chart was very useful. Consider resizing it so readers don't have to scroll to see it.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The one chart is used properly, and aids in understanding the content.</p>",,,-1,<p>All the tests return with a success and can run rspec on it successfully.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes they have converted all of their explained tests in the Test Plan into automated RSPEC tests. I can't test whether or not they fail, but I assume they do work due to the nature of them, though I believe they should explain on the website that they worked or not and show how they worked.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. They have all the tests for all the cases. All of them passed.</p>,,,1,"<p>There is no formal test plan and so cannot verify this. However, this team has included a testing section in the wiki which explains the conditions being tested. Not as thorough as a testing plan but these tests are inclusive of most of the cases.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The writeup of the project had provided a test plan with a few test cases covering both expected cases and edge cases. I was able to find corresponding test cases written in the rspec file too.</p>,,,-1,<p>The author does not have a Test Plan.</p>,,,1,"<p>https://github.com/arunkrishce/expertiza should be linked, that is were I got your code from. The methods named question_max_score is not being tested, your only testing average_score_for_row method. The variables will look better is renamed from score to entry1,2,3. Name of classes and methods explain well on their purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>After looking through the code, I think they chose good variable and method names that are representative of the function and role they play. The build passed, but the codeclimate test checking device has issues that haven't passed, so i'm unsure why that is. I did mark that the build passed because the one labeled build passed, though this codeclimate issue should be looked into.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Do you think the name of ""no_of_columns"" could be changed to ""no_of_nonempty_columns""?</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the code written is short and concise and follows ruby conventions. The method name is descriptive of the function it performs and so are the variable name.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has modified a model and added a new rspec model file. For these code changes, they have used proper naming conventions to name variables, methods and class names. They have ensured that the newly created variables and methods use the same style as the code that is already present in the model file. I felt that every named item in the code was self explanatory and the purpose of each variable/method was understood from the name. For eg, row_average_score was a variable used to store the average of all the entries in a row. Hence I am giving a 5.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The author has successfully put in a Pull Request to expertiza.&nbsp; Furthermore, the code successfully increases coverage.&nbsp; The code itself is well written with variables and methods being named appropriately.</p>",,,1,"<p>There is no comments included, as well as its DRY. Use ""let"" to create the objects which can be reusable with before(:each) instead of defining scores every single time for each test. The code is easy to follow and is straight forward.</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall there isn't too much code to look at, but I think the format and place of the code was very logical. It was all in a model, where they altered aspect to exclude nil from the calculation. There really isn't too much that had to be added, so i don't think any needs to be extracted into a separate method. They did comment next to a line of code, which is not encouraged, since it can get confusing where to look for comments. Comments should be made before a method is defined on their own separate lines. Other than that, I think the model and testcases added are written in good Ruby style, is DRY, and overall structured in a logical and coherent fashion.</p>",,,1,"<p>The function is not long at all. And they are nicely written, easy to read and easy to understand.</p>",,,1,"<p>The function written is short and DRY. I cannot see a lot of repetition. However, i would like to suggest that in lines&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ""row_average_score /= no_of_columns unless no_of_columns.zero?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; row_average_score.round(2)</p>
<p>these lines can be clubbed together using method chaining which makes the code more ruby like.</p>",,,-1,"<p>By reviewing the code, I made the following observations:</p>
<p>1) None of the functions are too long; Neither the method added in vm_question_response_row.rb nor the methods in spec file are long, they are all around 8-15 lines each and good modular approach was followed.</p>
<p>2) I felt the code was already modular and hence no new method is needed.</p>
<p>3) Apart from a couple of comments in the model file, I couldn't find comments anywhere else, especially in the rspec file where they have made a lot of changes in their different commits including the hex codes.</p>
<p>4) Proper Ruby conventions were followed throughout, including double spacing, having the logic in the models and no code felt repetitive.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code seems reasonable and well written.&nbsp; The functions are of appropriate length and common code has been extracted successfully. One thing that would be helpful would be adding code comments to help the reader understand what is happening in the code.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The features work as intended, there aren't any edge cases I can think of in this situation, since the only choices you have to answer a question or leave it empty.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Unfortunately since we can't deploy our projects, i cant test the author's work.</p>",,,1,<p>This is only because we haven't figured out how to deploy it. And I could not test it manually.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the intended features are functional. The repo has not been deployed and thus i cloned the repo on my local machine and ran it. The features are working correctly. I cannot think of any corner cases where this code will break.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The project was not deployed on a platform such as Heroku or AWS and hence I was not able to test any of the newly added features. However, I am awarding two points because I was able to see a screencast demo of the project where the team was able to run the project in their local server showcasing the new functionalities.</p>",,,-1,<p>I was unable to test the authors code due to being out of time.</p>,,,-1,"<p>It explains that in calculating the score it ignores the empty fields, so the score does not calculate the empty fields as a zero in the final calculation of the score.

I can easily understand the project is focused around the subject of fixing peer review scores, as fields that are left blank are included in the math to calculate average review score. I understand that their project and goal is to fix this issue, to enable a more accurate calculation of average peer review score. They also describe very coherently how the project fixes the issue. They explain in the '<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px;"">/app/models/vm_question_response_row.rb</span>' model file, they alter code to exclude nil values from the calculation of peer review score, which are the values of those blank review score entries. Overall, i appreciate the thorough method in which they explain the project.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The explanation of their work is precise and clear. Especially with the youtube video, it is really easy to understand. Good job, guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup is very descriptive. It clearly indicates the problem statement as well as the proposed solution. The screencast added is pretty descriptive and makes understanding this wiki really easy. The UI results after the change have been clearly indicated and are suggestive of the fact that the implementation was successful.</p>
<p>I would suggest to include a screenshot of the successful tests to strengthen the wiki. Also it would have been better to add the original code along with the newly submitted code to the wiki to make it more descriptive.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup was well written. It clearly explains the problem statement, the solution, the files added/changed and the test cases included. Some screenshots were also provided which helped me in understanding the problem statement properly. From the writeup, I could easily understand that the aim of the project was to ensure that empty fields should not be included while calculating metrics such as average score. Overall, it was written in simple, easy to understand manner and hence I am giving a 5.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The author has done an adequate job with their write up.&nbsp; I feel as though they could have added more information about what their project was about and what it did.&nbsp; That being said, the attached video helped a lot with understanding the projects scope.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It looks complete to me. You have tested when there is no empties, when there are some empties mixed in, as well as when all the fields were left empty. The only concern I have with the Test Plan section is you using nil and empty interchangeably. This could be confusing, it is best to stick with one, unless you are referring it has two different things then explain when nil occurs separably from empty.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Due to the scope of their project, I can say the test plan looks complete. They tested essentially the three types of cases and then variations of them to thoroughly test their model. They test when scores are all non-nil, all nil, and a mixture of the two, which conceivably are the 3 separate blocks of cases. Then they further try tests where you have 0 in some, not in others, or nil mixed in, and it goes on from there. I think they covered all of the scenarios which pertain to their contribution.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yeah. I think the authors considered different scenarios for testing this method.</p>
<p>They covered all the cases (all null, all not null, and mix of both).</p>
<p>I don't think there are input values for this method.</p>
<p>Pre-conditions, if you mean @score_row instance variables, I think this should be tested in other places, not for this method.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There is no formal test plan section included. However this team has taken testing into account and have mentioned a testing strategy in the wiki. The test cases seems exhaustive. But including a screenshot of the running tests or coverage report would have been better.</p>
<p>I tried to run the rspec file on my local machine but faced an error saying could not load the file. This may be because , i am using my local environment and the database config might differ. Were the tests running for you.? If not, given the fact that your functionality is functional, you should check the tests once.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup has a separate testing section which mentions the new rspec file that was added and gives an explanation to the test cases added in the file. The precondition is to be logged in but precondition test cases were not written. Automated test cases were written for valid, invalid inputs and edge cases and screenshot of the rspec file was also provided. Although Automated testing was done properly, I don't find any steps to perform manual testing and hence reducing 1 point.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The wiki does not include a Test Plan.&nbsp; It does include screenshots of the authors test cases which is helpful, but without explanation, it is hard to understand.</p>",,,1,"<p>It was explained underneath the solution heading of the method used but does not clearly state why they approached it by ""<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">If a score is empty, it should not be counted while calculating average score. Only not null review scores are to be counted while dividing by the total number of reviews, for the average score calculation.</span></p>",,,1,"<p>They do explain how they did the work. In fact, they have a section well named 'Explanation' which talks about the implementation, and what they changed to enable correct functionality. Another note to point, it explains that the implementation directly corrects the problem they describe earlier on, meaning they talk about nil fields, and then they explain in the implementation how they fix this problem, which is good consistency. They don't explain why necessarily, but I think the explicit way they describe the problem and implementation implicitly answers the question. They did it this way because it leaves out those nil values recorded as an empty score field. They didnt use any design principles or patterns, but simply came up with a simple and quick fix to the issue.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The algorithm they used to&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">calculate the average peer-reviewed score is well explained.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the wiki clearly indicates the proposed solution of the problem. No design patterns have been used. This is because the controller method that was modified to achieve functionality is relatively small and therefore does not warrant the use of a design pattern. Overall the method is well written following ruby conventions and the method name is descriptive of its functionality.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup explains the problem statement and then goes on to explain how the team went about solving it. It mentions the name of the file that was modified and test scenarios are also explained clearly. Screenshots of code snippet were added, which was very helpful in understanding the implementation of the project.

They continuously name the same variables (score1, score2, score3, ... scoren) where they could potentially put them in a before(:each) block and eliminate the need to use up all that space. The expectations are done well, but setting up that code in a more DRY way can be very useful and just make the code more manageable and easier to understand and follow. Other than that, they do have the situations labelled well as to distinguish specifically what each test does.</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall the code is written really well. Good work. And testing is really thorough.</p>
<p>I suggested one variable name change. Maybe they don't think it is a good idea.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is pretty concise and well written.

<p>In the first round, it was suggested that the lines shown below could be clubbed together using method chaining to make the code more ruby like. However this does not seem to be implemented.

Essentially, when a score was blank or nil, it was taken into consideration when calculating average score, even though it contributed nothing to the score. This in essence divided the score incorrectly to create the average. However after adding their code to fix this, the score is then calculated correctly.

What I mean by this, is there is not too much explanation, but ultimately due to the scope of their project, there doesn't need to be much explanation. They explain the problem, the implemented solution, and then have a concise but well crafted explanation of the tests they added. So when i say sufficient, i don't mean it as a bad thing, but as they kept it concise but satisfying all of the important conditions. They haven't added anything, but it seems in general they didn't fix anything between submissions, which I am a bit disappointed about.</p>",,,-1,<p>The writeup is well written.

Great job! The Wiki should outline a few more features and expected outcomes, as this provide a clearer picture of what changed from a UI sense and what can be tested.

<p>The other suggestion I would make is to either put references in the references section or have them referenced somewhere in the wiki. You currently have no references.

However, the tests seem to cover everything I can think of regarding the users controller.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team's design appears to be sound and follows appropriate principles.&nbsp; Since the team is writing integration tests, it is not really necessary that they follow specific design patters. That being said, the team does appear to be following strong RSPEC design principles as they have gone through and picked out all the testable case they know need to be tested.&nbsp; For each of these test cases, they have written an RSPEC ""describes"" clause describing what the test will do.&nbsp; Because of this, it seems like they are on track.&nbsp; Great job!</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes.

Good work!</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, since the team's project is to write integration tests, they of course need a test plan.&nbsp; The team provides a solid test plan and has done a really good job explaining what each method they test will do.&nbsp; While they have done a pretty good job explaining what will be tested, it might help to add a short explanation for each test.&nbsp; This is something I mentioned as well in my initial review.&nbsp; For instance, under the ""Create"" method, one of the described tests states, ""Is this the name new? If yes, good. Otherwise, register the user by email address"".&nbsp; This is a bit confusing to me, as I don't fully understand what is going on.&nbsp; It seems to be saying if the name is new, then don't register a new user, but this seems contradictory to the idea of a ""create"" method.&nbsp; Because of this, it would be nice to have some added explanation attached to each tests.&nbsp; Other then that though, everything looks good.</p>",,,-1,<p>Very thorough test plan.

Initially it is mentioned that these supplementary questionnaire will not be graded but the UML diagram mentions that the SRQ scores would be appended to the original review scores. Also I'm not sure as to whether these would be optional or not. If they are optional, I believe people wouldn't be keen on answering them. If they are not graded, it is not fair for some people reviewing to do additional work in reviewing the team's work. It could be added as an optional bonus if answered.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Very good explanation. While the topics aren't super simple and the explanation alone may have been tough to understand, the UML diagrams plus screenshots really make it quite easy to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Very easy to follow any your design makes sense. I think the only tricky thing will be ensuring that you are displaying the correct questionnaire for each team. Assuming that a questionnaire for each team would be unique then this should be pretty straightforward.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The code follows Ruby and Rails best practices to the best extent possible. Most of the code is generated by scaffold so follows the systematic hierarchy of the scaffold. The authors have also put comments wherever necessary, which is helpful. The code is also properly indented as per ruby standards.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows MVC architecture and shows good Ruby and Rails coding practices.</p>,,,1,"<p>The user interface is very simple and easy to understand It provides the necessary links. But certain views are not properly detailed. Certain views show links that are not needed in that view, like a recruiter should only be able to view the available jobs there is no need to provide an apply link for the job for the recruiter view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, it says that 20 commits were added between the first and second submissions, which is good that it basically means that functionality was improved.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has only tested the Jobs controller. According to the spec file a model and a controller has to be tested</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the code was regularly committed.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, there were enough commits to justify that the team has constantly pushed their changes to GitHub.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, it seems the majority of commits were made between the first and second round of submissions. Several of these commits seemed geared towards solving code climate issues and ensuring that the build passes Travis CI. The team did a good job of evenly dividing the commits between members, and a great job of committing changes early and often. The only suggestion I have is maybe more explicit commit messages.</p>",,,1,<p>Most of the code has been implemented in the first round with lots of refactoring and modifications done in the second round. There are lots of commits made (40 commits) which shows they have been pushing the changes then and there to the master.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, a good amount of commits have been made in the after the 1st round.</p>",,,1,"<p>You appear to have done a more then adequate job following ""good Ruby on&nbsp; Rails coding practices"".&nbsp; For example, in your controllers, all lines are indented with 2 spaces.&nbsp; You have used ""each"" instead of ""for"" when applicable and all end points are documented in the controllers.&nbsp; One thing that could still be improved is the javadoc or over all code documentation.&nbsp; As a whole, it is a bit weak.&nbsp; I would suggest checkout out this resource on how to javadoc methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Javadoc helps readability a lot by giving the reader a better understanding of what the method does.&nbsp; It also helps give the reader context, by explaining the parameters that go into the function, and the return value that comes out of the function.&nbsp; If there was one suggesting I would make it would be to work on javadoc in the future.&nbsp; Here is a resource that you might find helpful!&nbsp;&nbsp;https://dev.liferay.com/participate/javadoc-guidelines</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the application has been deployed successfully on heroku.&nbsp; It works very well and is easy to use and understand.&nbsp; On top of this, the Read me documentation is very easy to follow and informative!&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>There were lots of commits made during the 2nd round.&nbsp; In addition it wasn't just one big commit.&nbsp; Most were very small which is good. While I think y'all did a good job with the commits a little longer description could be nice.&nbsp; I had to go into the commit to truly know what was changed.&nbsp; But besides that good job!</p>,,,1,"<p>The jobs controller was thoroughly tested using proper rspec techniques.&nbsp; The tests were well named and easy to follow and understand.&nbsp; On top of that, the team did a good job testing all of the crud operations associated with each controller.&nbsp; What I did not see though, was model testing.&nbsp; This should definitely be added, for instance, filling out ""test/models/compnay_test.rb"" shouldn't be difficult.&nbsp; For some information on how testing in ruby on rails works, I would suggest this resource.&nbsp; http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes new code was committed during the second round.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the team pushed a total of 27 commits to&nbsp; master.&nbsp; On top of this, each team member contributed a decent share of the commits so this is good!&nbsp; This number of commits suggests solid group contribution.&nbsp; Committing and pushing to github regularly is helpful for many reasons.&nbsp; One, it makes building a large, shared application much easier as everything can be built in little bite sized pieces.&nbsp; While it appears you all had no problem achieving this, one thing that might prove helpful in the future, is utilizing separate branches, and the issues section in github.&nbsp; Using separate branches, allows each issue to be associated with a specific code branch off of master.&nbsp; This is useful, as when a pull request is made into master, the other team members are able to see exactly what that pull request contains.&nbsp; Creating Github issues is helpful in that it makes chopping up a large project into smaller, easier to understand tasks very simple.&nbsp; Each issue can be assigned to different team members, and it helps everyone contribute an equal amount and work well together as a team.</p>",,,1,<p>I was unable to access the AWS deployment so I attempted to test in my personal environment. After pulling the repo and building as normal I ran into several errors and was unable to test the functionality. I would leave the stars section blank but I cannot seem to remove my rating for some reason.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. It works as intended.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The sample submission link and functionality seems to be working.</p>
<p>This is not a testing project rather an implementation project.</p>",,,1,"<p>It wasn't easy/clear to switch between jobseeker/recruiter role.&nbsp; While technically possible, you had to disable one role to make it work.&nbsp; As a recruiter, you couldn't see the companies in a list.&nbsp; Job applications had no way to see the job they were connected to which made it difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to do anything useful with the job applications.</p>",,,1,"<p>From the screenshot, it is seen that the functionality&nbsp;is well implemented both from student view and from instructor view.<br />A screencast could have been attached to verify the flow.</p>",,,-1,<p>Controllers had autogenerated tests and Job controller also had a single RSpec test implemented. There were no tests on the models.</p>,,,-1,<p>Everything seems to work well.&nbsp; I did not exhaustively test everything (probably out of the scope of the review) but in the tests that I ran everything worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>There were only a total of 27 commits for 3 contributors and almost all of them were on the Friday of the final submission.</p>,,,1,"<p>The UI operations work as expected. Though not a testing project, the authors have included tests to verify their functionality.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Wel written in ruby format. Naming conventions appear to have been followed.</p>,,,-1,"<p>After each role signed in, the homepage is showing different tasks each role could perform. This is very nice.</p>
<p>However, the action each role could perform is not really restricted. Each role can basically do everything admin did by directly going to the url.</p>
<p>Another thing is, when an application is submitted, it is associated with the company, not the job. I find this is a little strange.</p>",,,1,"<p>Everything works as intended, but I had some difficulty making sure that the sample submissions were actually being displayed for the correct student.&nbsp; Nonetheless, great job on the UI ya'll!</p>",,,-1,<p>Only tested one controller. And not thorough testing. Did not test fail cases.</p>,,,1,"<p>The writeup is amazing! I really liked the graphics that helped explained everything.&nbsp; While it probably could have been explained in words, the pictures really helped make things clearer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Only 23 commits over 3 days of committing&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The writeup is quite descriptive. It contains explanation regarding the project issues. The authors have included code snippets which makes it easier for the reader to follow the changes made in the code. They could have included explanation regarding why the changes were made by adding a few comments. They have included a Test Plan stating all the test cases considered, they can also add a screenshot of the test passing so that the readers know that all the tests work.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I am not quite sure about this.</p>
<p>One thing is, for an instructor to select past assignment as a sample, it seems like all the assignment with valid course id would all show up in the list.</p>
<p>Does this mean every instructor would have accesses to all the assignments in the database? Is this an issue or my understanding is not correct?</p>
<p>Another thing is, could we improve this by providing a search function to search relevant assignments not listing all the available ones&nbsp;</p>

But it looks like mainly two of them were working on the project.</p>,,,1,"<p>The writeup looks great and I was able to understand what your project is suppose to do.&nbsp; One of the highlights that I thought strengthen your writeup was your use of diagrams and pictures to show the flow of how students are able to make their assignment public and how they are able to view sample submissions based on what an instructors makes public for students.&nbsp; The only thing that I think it lacks in is direction of how to guide the reviewer on how to test your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, when a reviewer wants to test your deployed application, which student/instructor should they log in as to ensure that what they see matches what your sample submission pictures in the writeup.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup is descriptive and well written. The project objective and the proposed solution has been clearly stated. They have added snippets and explained them which is an improvement from the last submission. This has made the wiki a lot easier to understand. The test plan section has been included with detailed descriptions of the different testing scenarios and the corresponding spec snippets have also been added. It would have been better to include the screenshots of the Rspec results.</p>

Not only was it in this last week, but centered around one day, so they pushed at the very end basically. Honestly you can get into trouble with this sort of approach, especially if you are working for some client and they just don't know how anything is turning out.

The sections are divided well and each one is explained in an easy to understand manner. They are not too verbose, but not terse either. The minus 1 is for the things. The developed code sections feels slightly redundant as you included the pull request at the bottom, a reviewer can check the pull request rather than read the wiki.

They certainly improved upon the readability of their document! They have a nice graphic that explains the couple of different control paths that were created and improved upon, which helped me to test out the deployed application. They clearly laid out the project tasks they had set out to accomplish, which is a nice touch. They then separated by each task and showed the code they added to accomplish said procedure, which i like because it gives an organization that is easy to follow as viewer. They have a clearly laid out test plan section where they show the test situations they added in RSpec. This is good, but perhaps it would be better if they would explain their reasoning behind the tests, which i feel would be more representative of a test&nbsp;<em>plan</em>, rather than show the test implementation right off the bat. They end on a future scope which is a great idea because it makes it slightly easier for the instructors.</p>",,,1,"<p>The improved the writeup a lot since last review.

I do think this is a good starting place though, because they definitely seem to have done great work! I do think the views should be limited in the inclusion of logic, and they were not quite aligned with this though, but other than that they wrote fairly well styled code.

But for now it's hard to say whether it's helpful and necessary to help reader understand the project, however I guess when they almost finished their tasks they will update a rectified DB table&nbsp;on wiki, so at that time by comparing the rectified and old table, it will be very helpful for readers to figure out their project purpose and how they achieve them. Anyway, the table is well designed and shows their intentions.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design copy and pasted the required funcionalities listed on the main document, so yes, objectively the design does incorporate them somewhat.

It is good that the team communicated that they will update the wiki to reflect the current DB schema, however instead of stating the potential changes, the structure of the entire wiki was instead presented. I think once the team dives a bit deeper into the project, they will be able to provide the names of the DB tables that were changed or removed.</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall, the scope of the project seems sound. It is difficult to guage whether or not the changes will have potential risky effects to the application without knowing which parts of the DB are being altered. However, as long as the team does go back update the doc with the details of their changes, it will become easier to analyze the effectiveness on the design of the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>No visual aids were used, and it would be a bit tricky for the team to include any on this one. However, screenshot of how various tables in the DB are linked together presently would have been a nice use of visual aids. I would suggest somehow providing a visual aid that helps provide the rationale for each change made to the DB. This would allow for more understanding regarding the project and the impact of the changes.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design does not describe how it will incorporate all of the required functionality,&nbsp;but it does claim that it will, and it describes several specific requirements that will be completed.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has made good commits for the 2nd round which indicates the team has been actively working on improving the project.

I didn't find anything hard in following it.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be try to check out Ext-JS(Javascript) library to sort the table. It provides and extensive way of sorting by clicking the column names.</p>",,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Travis CI build has passed, however, they are having code climate issues yet and the coverage is 45%</p>",,,1,"<p>The author hasn't made any changes to the code, so i couldn't comment whether he/she is adding to a wrong class or not and same is the case whether the new design could make the code smelly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the author has mentioned about using highchart javascript, it is one of the best libraries available around to do data visualization. Highchart javascript library maintains the response time of the system and it is really efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For sorting purpose, the author hasn't figured out any solution, so he/she can check out this gem ""sortable-table"" to do the sorting. This would my sugesstion.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author has provided one basic mockup screen to understand about the visualization. Though the screen looks fine in terms of appearance, it lacks the information that is expected by the user. There should be more details explained in the writeup interm of the mockups.</p>
<p>The author could have given a UML diagram that helps to understand the functionality more. Try to refer the good writeup posted by our professor to figure out how UML diagram has to be.</p>",,,-1,<p>Commits were made according to the review given in the first round and changes were made accordingly.</p>,,,1,"<p>The team seems to have a decent idea of the purpose of the project, what they are supposed to do, how they plan to do it, visualization of how it would roughly look like. Currently they have the testing plan section empty. As this is more of an add-on project, I believe they would be doing same tests as previously and additional tests for the new functionalities. I feel that they have a pretty good understand of the details in the picture they have created. I would try to point out each part of the picture and put text alongside it to help others understand. However, they have written it down below, this could be another alternate better visualization for helping reviewers understand.</p>",,,-1,<p>No visualizations are necessary for this project.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the code is well written and follows the conventions of Ruby design principles.</p>",,,-1,<p>The write-up is clear and self-explanatory</p>,,,1,"<p>No testing section is included, but the tests for this project are going to basically involve running the test from each other module that has some DB interaction. So that is out of the scope of this project I think.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, as per my understanding the code is well-written and has covered edge cases, but since the pull request has not been accepted yet, I believe there are minor changes to be done</p>",,,-1,"<p>They added new test cases for the project, coverage increases by 0.8%, altough there are few comments in the code, so it is difficult to understand the code flow</p>",,,1,<p>Again the design is to create migrations which should be rather simple to read and understand. As long as the team doesn't attempt to perform updates on several DB in a single migration then the design is sound and simple.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>As mentioned from the wiki, they have covered all the test cases</p>
<p>Since comments are not present, it is difficult to understand the flow of code</p>",,,1,"<p>The design in general is going to be to create rails migrations, as long as the team follows good migration practices this should be really straightforward for designs.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>I feel that by making changes to the code and removing unnecessary and repeated statements in the test cases the code can be improved more and thus can be dried up a lot, which will then be ready for deployment.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have done well with the writeup. They have done a good job of explaining the test scenarios and also have uploaded a screen cast which makes it easy for a reviewer to review their work.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The code works fine and tests cover all the scenarios, but the code could have coupled the repeated statements in before each and that would have been great.</p>",,,1,"<p>While the team has described the problem statement in their design document, the rest of their document seems to be a bit shallow. In my original review I had suggesting writing a UML or Wireframe to describe the technical layout of the teams project. This does not appear to be implemented as of yet, but is something I would highly suggest focusing on before you all begin the coding portion of your project.&nbsp; Having a wireframe and UML written up really helps all members of a team to stay on the same page as everyone can just reference the wireframe or UML when coding different portions of the project.&nbsp; This way, when everyone is working on different tasks, each member understands the big picture, and can implement a more moduler and appropriate solution.</p>",,,-1,<p>The coverage has increased a lot and reached 100% coverage. The team did a good job in covering all cases and edge conditions.</p>,,,1,"<p>The build passed in Travis CI. The codeclimate issues still exist and they could be taken care of, moreover I feel the code could have been dried up more by removing repeated let statements.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes they have pushed changes after the round1 of the project.</p>,,,-1,<p>The team has covered almost all the functionalities as per the document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hEnWHshzGCvN5zBMA90L9-eQuuNKX7skYkkwwOQSjyU/edit). I do not have any suggestions here.</p>,,,1,"<p>The code is well written but could have been dried up more, there are some repeated declarations in the let(..) statements of rspec that could have pushed up in their before(:each)&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>They have done a really great job trying to explain it to users. They have tried to help reviewers understand their work by adding the picture. They have also added description below it which implies they have the exact understanding of what needs to happen. However, I would better like it if they could add more details to the diagram instead of ""Data"" buttons, adding more texts like ""Round x""..etc. That would add some more clarity.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design appears to be sound. I don't think we should be expecting to see what new methods would make the code more smelly. As this is the initial stage of the design document, this would be something to evaluate in the later stages post implementation. However, they have done a great job at describing the purpose of their project and how they plan to accomplish it. They have even looked into what resources they plan to use for changing the color scheme. I would just recommend making the figure more detail oriented than it is as of now.</p>",,,-1,"<p>As I said earlier, they have tried to explain all the aspects of the projects. They did add what is expertiza section which was told by the professor not to do in last week's lecture, but well that doesn't matter much. They have added diagrams which I believe with a bit more details would be fantastic. Apart from that, great work!</p>",,,-1,"<p>Test plan section is empty, and there is no explanation of how the mockup fulfills the requirements, or how the intended functionality will be implemented.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There is very little information describing the intended design except for a single image.

However, very little detail is given.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has not included a test plan.&nbsp; That being said, they may not need one since the project only requires them to rewrite some of the database files.&nbsp; Because of this, they may only need to check to make sure previous tests pass.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The diagram is helpful and clean, however it is not explained, and it is difficult to determine where it fits in with their design.</p>",,,-1,<p>They have explained that the databases that are unused need to be removed.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>Simple and concise</p>,,,-1,<p>No Diagrams present however there is a huge list of databases which is unnecessary as a design doc</p>,,,-1,<p>No test plan outlined</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team explained what their plan is, the purpose of the project, added a mockup for visualization. The test plan is not implemented yet.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>According to the description for their topic, they have included&nbsp;all details. However, as the main document for the final project states: ""Your design document does not have to (and should not!) explain what Ruby on Rails is, or what Expertiza is, or what Mozilla/Servo is."" So, maybe you should delete the Expertiza description.</p>",,,-1,<p>It is unclear if they know how many databases need to be changed and how they plan to test if their changes cause side effects or how they plan to go about detecting unused databases</p>,,,-1,"<p>The changes that they are going to implement are clear and detailed, easy to read and follow.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team's plan is clear: to change visualization graphics.

Although not all things have been added, I am able to get an idea of what the team is planning to implement. There is an empty test plan section. As the functionalities that the team is expected to implement, they have a lot of freedom to try and implement different ideas. I would have loved if the authors had been a little more descriptive of the things that they are trying to implement.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>As the project is still in a nascent phase, I don't think the authors will have an exact picture of what the final product will look like. That said, the doc is descriptive enough of the functionalities the team would try to incorporate.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The functionalities the team wishes to implement are easy to understand from the doc. The team has made a good effort in trying to explain what the changes would possibly look like. As there no predefined changes the authors are expected to make, it is difficult to explain in entirety what the end result would be. But the team has done a great job with whatever they know as of now.</p>",,,-1,<p>It is very difficult to know as of now about the exact changes the team will make. But I think they are on the right track and the design they have proposed seems to do the job as of now.</p>,,,-1,"<p>There aren't any UML diagrams. The screen mock up they have provided seems good enough. They have also explained how they plan to make these changes. As of now, the visual aids they have provided seem to do the job.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has provided the project purpose and the design plan. The testing plan hasn't been provided at all.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design does incorporate the given functionality of integration of review performance and class performance.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The authors have explained the changes sufficiently, a demo image has been provided for easier understanding.</p>",,,1,<p>The exact changes which are required in the files isn't provided at all.

More diagrams such as flow chart of the logic etc should have been provided.</p>,,,1,"<p>Every&nbsp;section is included except for the testing plan. All other sections are well documented and easy to read. Great work on this. The lack of test plan is fairly understandable at this point so I did not feel that it should lose a significant number of points. On the lower end, however, there is no UML, but a wireframe is present at least. I think if a UML were added and update the test plan this would merit full points for this section.</p>",,,1,"<p>I like the use of the problem statement to list out all the items you need to address. However, while you do address these I think you need to add a section telling how you will fix these issues with your own functionality. I think you do this in part, and I if you keep on this same line of thinking when discussing the implementation you will earn full points.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think the wireframe and explanations that are provided are great and are presented well. However, I think it would be great to have a bulleted&nbsp;list where you address each problem directly with your solution. Use the same numbering as you did in the problem statement section. This will certainly improve the document and make it incredibly clear and easy to follow.</p>",,,1,"<p>The wireframe provided appears simple enough and looks like it solves the issue of the confusing visualizations that are discussed in the problem statement. Since only a wireframe is provided it is difficult to tell whether you would be adding methods to the wrong class. I think, however, that with more effort and with the creation of a UML diagram I could give more useful feedback about your design.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Again I think the wireframe provided is great, but you need to add UMLs to show what code you are planning to modify.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The wiki is well written. some sections are still missing, but i get the idea what the project wants to establish.

Although the given image can be used to get all the information about the project, more images can be added to make it more informative.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have given a good introduction to the project in their description. They have added a ""Problem Statement"" section and a ""Preliminary Design"" section for the same. But the team needs to expand these sections as well as add more relevant sections to their documentation.</p>
<p>They need to add ""Proposed Implementation"" and need to fill in details in the ""Test Plan"" section.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design incorporates the features, but only at a very high level.

The author has clearly explained the changes that are going to made to the system by showing the list of files to be modified. The changes are almost in the view part of the MVC though there is only one change in the controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the team has mentioned about the files that are going to be modified, it would have been more understandable if they had included more information or specific information on the changes made in the file.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author has explained the design process of the system by using the flowchart and also they have included few screenshot of the mockup screens and a simple visualization UI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team is using flot javascript library instead of highchart javascript library which the previous team has worked on. Looks like they have chosen the correct design pattern as flot library is more efficient and has rich tools to provide visualization.</p>
<p>As the team is modifying one controller file they could have explained the particular design pattern they are using for that. MVC is most cases.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has provided a clean design process flow of what the system is going to offer with necessary visualization to have the reader understand the design clearly. The design looks simple as almost all the changes are made to the view files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design process shows how the&nbsp;specific&nbsp;screens are displayed by using the decision statements. Good work team.</p>",,,-1,"<p>This particular project is a visualization type and it requires necessary mockups/figures that describe the changes made to the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author has included a mockup screen on how the details are shown to the instructor. Design looks clean and neat. It is easy for the instructor to find specific information which is most important for any UI design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has included mockup graphs and&nbsp;charts on what all operation could be performed. Overall the visualization part is done well by the team after looking over the first review comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Almost all the changes done by the team are in the view and so the test plan is not necessary. Though one controller is being modified by the team, they have mentioned clearly in the test plan on what file they are changing and what the changes are.</p>",,,1,"<p>They have improved quite a lot from the first round of review. I noticed these major improvements:</p>
<p>1. Adding more content to the problem statement</p>
<p>2. Added design workflows to clearly describe step by step of how the user should interact.</p>
<p>3. Testing plan was empty during the first round of review which is now filled, so that's good.</p>
<p>4. Addressed the comments about visuals missing / different ways to represent it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion: It is nice to see significant improvements and you have tried to address almost all the issues. Judging by how your project is, I feel that more diagrams would make it really nice to visualize. You have lot of factors like:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=""language-markup""><code>number of reviews performed, the length of the reviews, the summary of the reviews, whether or not the reviewers uploaded a file in their review, the average ratings the reviewers received from authors</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>They have improved quite a bit from the last submission. They have added more visuals to the design doc which is nice. I mentioned in the previous review about the 2nd image in the design doc. I think that it is lacking more details on the screen and what those charts are. Also, the last diagram seems a little absurd to me personally as I am not able to understand the X, Y axis, what do the colors represent. These details can be very informative to the reviewers.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design does appear to be pretty neat as they are trying to disambiguate things by adding more visuals. But as I said earlier, this particular project seems like it needs lot more visuals than other projects might need. They have definitely improved over time but I think adding more details would be better.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Again, they have certainly put in work and improved a lot from previous submission. They have added work flows which show user interaction which has cleared a lot of things about the project than what I understood earlier. As I said, I personally feel that this particular project topic might need a lot more visuals compared to other reports as you have a lot of graphs, metrics, parameters to deal with and that needs more visuals, details on what graphs represent.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think this is a good enough test plan. They did not have a testing plan earlier which they have now which is nice. I believe it is okay to keep the same tests as the previous version, however adding more additional tests, ensuring the previous work is not missing any required test cases would be something I would include in the doc.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team did an excellent job concisely explaining what the problem is and what they need to change to enhance the visualization for instructors.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Everything is well-organized, all sections are descriptive to the point. They have added the testing plan and more visual aid since the previous submission. Good job!</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design is very clear, no clutter, the flow is intuitive and very easy to follow.</p>",,,-1,"<p>With&nbsp;the second submission the team did a great upgrade of what they had for visualization before. More charts, more explanations, a nice graphical process diagram, all were dded to enhance the design document.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The team mentions to add RSpec tests.</p>,,,1,<p>The chart showing stacked bar charts could be simplified to make it easier to see the relative percentages of teams in each scoring range.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The test plan is described but not in much detail. I am sure once the design is complete, the authors will come up with a detailed test plan.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have painstakingly explained every aspect of the project in great detail.

The mock up screen they have provided is very intuitive and follows appropriate principles.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design is simple and very easy to understand. They have proposed various options that are possible. All the designs are very intuitive and easy to follow.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have added visualizations wherever needed and it makes the doc very appealing and easy to follow. The graphical flow of the process is apt and easy to understand.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design includes test plan. The main task here is refactoring the previously written code. They intend to test all the functionalities possible.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the authors have adequately explained the changes.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has explained the design well with the help of graphs and flow charts which i had suggested earlier. I am able to understand the flow due to this.</p>,,,1,<p>The selection of data representation could be handled in a better way. Instead of going to the pie chart and then depending upon the decision clicking on the stat plot is a bit redundant. You could improve this by giving the choices at the start itself.</p>,,,-1,<p>The diagram does represent the project clearly.</p>,,,-1,<p>The team has included a test plan but it's not clear what changes they will be making in it or how a user can test the changes made manually.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the authors have improved their explanations considerably. More graphics have been added, and I can easily understand the purpose of the project. I would still suggest that you add more depth to your test plan because it seems lacking, but you at least address the test plan so I will award most of the points. I would suggest that you make additions numbered tests, and while it may be difficult to determine the nature of these tests they should at least be written at a high level so I know you have done them.</p>",,,1,"<p>Aside from the missing test plan, I believe the design will work. I would suggest adding a UML so that we can see any potential design patterns you are using. At this stage, I appreciate all the visuals to aid my understanding, but a UML would be more appropriate than a graphical process flow.</p>",,,1,"<p>Without the UML it is difficult to tell the simplicity of the design, but based on the mock-up of the webpage I believe that the implementation&nbsp;will be as simple as possible while also communicating the appropriate information.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I think the visualizations are excellent and one of the best parts of this wiki. I appreciate the addition of the mock-up of the graphs you will show instructors. The only issue I had is that you do not have the UML diagram, but since I have already removed points for that I will not remove them here.

<p>Another thing they did very good is that they uses model's method in the application model to help listing all the applications for a job seeker. I think we did it in the controller. I like their way better.</p>
<p>I gave 4 stars:</p>
<ol>
<li>because they put a lot of logic in their views, such as index.html.erb for companies and jobs, trying to hide edit/delete button from job seeker or recruiter. I feel what you need to do is using authorization gem such as ""pundit"" to restrict user's ability for some actions on the website. Hiding buttons is good. But I don't think it is enough. Job seeker can still go to ""https://fathomless-brook-57752.herokuapp.com/companies/1/edit"" for editing companies.</li>
<li>(I don't know where to put this point, I will put it here) because I tried to update user's profile, eg ""Name"", but it kept tell me to include ""@"", I felt strange, so I went back to ""views/devise/registartions/edit.html.erb"", yes, you made a tiny mistake in line 16, by indicating that name field is an email field.</li>

The code in users_controller.rb&nbsp;can be dryer like what it looks like in other controller files. Extracting User.find params[:id] and params[:user].permit(:first_name, :last_name, ..) to become new private methods and then call these two methods from the public methods.</p>
<p>2. The if statements in update method is a little bit hard to read, maybe in this situation, you can add some clauses between conditions to make it easier to read.</p>",,,1,"<p>It seems no big problem.&nbsp;They followed the naming convention, properly used partials in views. Code is clean and well-written.</p>
<p>Maybe I can give a little advice:</p>
<p>If you do not need some actions in a particular controller, for example you do not need edit and show actions in dashboards_controller, then you do not need to write a blank method in it which may raise some issues when a user try to access them by URL, and instead you can write:</p>
<p>resources dashboards, only:[:index, :new, :create, :update, :destroy]</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is well structured throughout. Proper naming conventions have been used for variables, classes and methods. Devise has been used for authentication which is good. Most code is self-explanatory and commenting for code not auto-generated by Rails isn't necessary. The updates have been consistent with Ruby practices and MVC architecture.<br />However, as earlier, in controllers, after mentioning an access specifier, there should be an indentation. For eg: In Companies controller, after line 75 that contains the private access specifier, there should be an indentation for the code that follows. Also, the companies/index.html.erb in views contains redundant table rows. Eg: Line 41-48 of users/index.html.erb.<br />Overall, Ruby coding practices have been followed well.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has done a great job in terms of the UI. The application is deployed on Heroku and README file is very well detailed out. It includes information about what the application is capable of and what it is not. So no issue in testing the application. The interface is more than what was asked for and hence is appealing and intuitive. I loved the way there was a sidebar giving the user necessary options.<br />An improvement could be that all options be listed out in the sidebar since initially I thought there was no way to view other users or applications. Another improvement could be to do an authorization check on the view level instead of just on the controller side. This would hide options such as 'Create'/'Edit' when the user is not allowed to. But I don't think this should result in any deduction of points. Great job!</p>,,,-1,<p>Since the last review the UI has changed a lot. It has become easy to use and very informative.

<p>1) The program code_generation.py did not include comments which makes it difficult to follow the code and takes more time to understand and review.</p>
<p>2) In the program servo_automation_screenshot.py, the entire program is implemented in the main function(Long or Complicated function). Instead, the program could be modularized which makes it easier to maintain and reuse.</p>

<p>There are a few instances where a try-catch blocks are needed, or some other way of ensuring certain edge cases don't break the program. For example, one of the functions that saves a screenshot to a local directory does not check if the directory exists before trying to write to it. <br /><br />In addition, the code is commented quite well. Functions had headers that explained what they do, and in some instances certain lines had comments that clarified their purpose.</p>",,,1,<p>There was new code committed during the second round they are servo_automation_screenshot.py and start_servo.py.

The write-up is unclear and takes long time to set up the environment. Instead, the write-up could have been detailed illustrating the project. The write-up of the project could have been better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The write-up just included the project description which was in the project description given initially.</p>",,,1,"<p>The write up explains the project well as well as what was accomplished.

However, they can add more information to the writeup to make it more verbose. Rest is pretty good.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall, the writeup was good. The one area the team could've done better is the implementation section. As of the time this review was written, the implementation section has two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the process of building the project</li>
<li>the process of running the python script</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;I would've like to have read more about the structure of the python script.

The team has also uploaded a youtube link of their work which is more helpful. I feel some description that they have mentioned in the youtube video could have been added to the readme as well so that the reviewer dooes not have to go through the whole video to understand a part of the project. This could also be done by adding annonations to the video or by mentioning timestamps in the youtube video description for the features the project has. For example you could mention @4:00 part two of the project (screenshot) feature, or something similar.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>The wiki is pretty bare. If more details from the video were added it would be very useful. Added screenshots accompanied with explanations would do wonders.</p>,,,1,"<p>The team did a good effort to develop the project.

<p>These along with some other changes could make the project ready to be deployed onto the production server.</p>
<p>The project need not be redone from scratch instead it could be enhanced to make it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>It seems like the objectives of the project were not met fully. In addition, as a Mozilla reviewer also pointed out, the code style and readability are not optimal. In addition, the structure of the code (e.g. extracting functions from longer ones) will require attention. Overall I think the team is on the right track and this is a good starting place for a future team to pick up (as long as the code stays readable!).</p>",,,-1,"<p>The code is pretty good.

By looking at the comments on the pull request I can say that there is a good chance it will be accepted.</p>",,,1,"<p>According to the pull request, the code still needs a lot of changes. The code doesn't need to be redone from scratch, but this is not a good place for a future team to pick up on. Because of the changes, the code should not be deployed onto the production server. This is mainly because the changes seem to be dealing with these things (all of these things are changes that need to be made according to the comments from Josh):</p>

Only a small part is used to introduce this project. When I read it for the first time, very difficult to understand.

<p>Instead of this, they can use a before_action in someplace thats more common for the flow of code (like the application_controller.rb).

They do explain the background, that they want to include functionality to take metrics from Github and display them to instructors, which is pretty good. They describe their planned implementation, but don't go into project level specifics and actually explaining them going through the plan or how it works. They simply provide the interface by which they will receive these metrics, but not how it will talk specifically to Expertiza.

These errors may be due to my local machine.</p>
<p>However , they have included a screencast which is pretty descriptive and indicative of the functionality included by the author and thus it can be concluded that the functionality included by the authors is working fine. The screencast lacks audio. I believe adding audio to the screencast would have made it easier for the readers to understand.</p>
<p>It seems that the team faced a major javascript error , due to which the add bookmarks option is not included in the menu.

The instructions for UI testing are illustrated in details and thus are easy to understand.The authors have also proposed solutions for unimplemented problems which is impressive. They were unable to do it due to some other Javascript error which is not really their fault. One suggestion i had was to include the db files or the new migrations created in the wiki for the reader to understand. This would have enabled the reader to understand how the previous migrations were faulty and how it was changed.&nbsp;</p>

I dont think the coverage passed, especially with them only having two test cases. They had a large amount of code to set up the situation for the model, but ultimately there was only one test done in this case and you won't have too much assurance with these results. Perhaps it could be a future project's task to add tests to such a design or to fix the code climate problems, but more tests need to be added.</p>",,,1,"<p>The wiki page is not well written. The improvements and the testing topics have been left blank.</p>
<p>So , it is difficult for a new reviewer to find out the details that needs to be done to have a proper overview of the work done by the team.</p>
<p>A better explanation of the steps would have been beneficial.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Few test cases were added to github data controller spec and github datum spec which cover the functionality like retrieve_graphql_data, retrieve_github_url, show method in controller etc. So the test coverage has increased.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, basic test cases have been added for controller and model, but there must be more test cases directed towards corner cases, some sample cases could be if the repository is private or link is wrong or some other issue, it would have been better to have such cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The team added tests for controller and models file . The primary aim of the project was not testing , but the tests were seen to pass&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The team had added automated tests for a controller and model, which was also mentioned in their test plan document. However, since the build never completed, there is no coverage report from which I can tell if the coverage increased or not. The majority of the logic for this project seems to be in the github_data_controller and github_datum model and these two files were extensively covered using tests.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team added two tests, one for the model and for the controller. The tests seem to cover the basic expectations of the project i.e to retrieve the expected data. I would think the coverage would increase, but I am not sure since there is no mention of this. I believe the team could have a few more test cases testing edge cases or scenarios where the values are not retrievable due to a private repository or when a student uses multiple accounts to push commits.</p>",,,1,<p>The team did a great job at this as far as I understand. The testing plan in the wiki page clearly specifies where to look and what to expect which I really liked. The files specified has a new functions and the content in one of the files was not present earlier in the first round of review which is now present. I believe they have done a great job at this. I had seen a team working on expertiza show the test cases passed and put a screenshot which could be a possible improvement.</p>,,,1,"<p>it was not possible to test the UI as it mentioned to clone and deploy the server, I would rather have one user associated have git profile associated with him and let user view it, also the images just give a static view and a video could have been much better.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has provided a brief description of setting up the project on our local environment and testing it out since they couldn't get it set up on a hosting service. I believe it would work, but going through a series of steps might be out of the scope (I believe) as a reviewer. The team could have looked into creating a detailed video showing the improvement work as expected.</p>",,,1,"<p>As I said earlier team has really put in efforts to improve from the first round and they seem to have added functions as well as improve the code. However, a screenshot of a terminal showing the test cases have passed/failed would have better helped understand for the reviewer. I would suggest try running the tests and put some information regarding the same and if the tests are failing reviewers might be able to help if they would have faced a similar issue.</p>",,,1,"<p>Well the writeup briefly mentions what the project is about and what is the team's approach towards the same.</p>
<p>One suggestion that I would like to give regarding the writeup is that the authors should elaborate a bit more on the Proposed Design and Improvements section.</p>",,,1,"<p>I found the writeup to be not sufficient.</p>
<p>If a step by step guideline or explanation was written in the wiki page, it would be easier for the reviewer to review.</p>
<p>For example , the Implementation and the testing headers were completely left blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>In the pull request it shows that 17 files were changed. But in the writeup only a portion of the change is mentioned. And the code is not described as well. Detailed steps can be given as to what the code is about and why its written the way it is.<br />Files modified/added section is highly required because 17 files were modified in the pull request.<br />Test cases need to be explained at the end.</p>,,,1,"<p>The writeup does seem good and gives the complete idea of what the though process was,</p>

They could add more information in the testing section about what tests were made and the results. But overall, job well done.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup has significantly improved for sure. They have added an improvements section which shows what they did in this round. They have also added screenshots of their outcome which I really liked.

If they are failing then reviewers might be able to help solve the issue</p>",,,1,"<p>I do not think this code is ready to be deployed mainly because of the staggering amount of code climate issues and the fact that the build failed. I think they did a great job in implementing such a useful feature, but there are hardly any tests done to validate that this won't break any pre-existing code. I think that maybe this could be used by a future team and built upon by fixing said issues and adding tests, and after that teams contribution could certainly be deployed to the production server.</p>",,,1,"<p>Honestly speaking, I had a tough time finding out the specific contribution the team made to the project.</p>
<p>The documentation and steps a reviewer should perform to get to the specific part of the code was not there.</p>
<p>So, apart from the snapshots, it was tough for me to find out the exact changes in the code made by the contributor.</p>",,,1,"<p>I would keep the code out of deployment until all the test cases have been met, which could be a different project as there are many aspects to be considered and many things will be looked into, even though the team has done a good job, but due to lack of test cases and more corner cases needed it would be better to keep this out of deployment.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors did provide link to their work&nbsp;forked&nbsp; on to their repository but&nbsp; a merger(pull request) was not found onto the actual repo .&nbsp;<br />The code / work seems to be complete as such , but not knowing the effects on the complete build of the system it might be difficult to comment about completion / pushing into production server</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, I think the code in terms of functionality based on the writeup and images is ready to be deployed in production and the team has put in a good effort. However I have two big concerns - one needs to manually test it to see if it's working as the team describes it does. Second, there could be more test cases covering different scenarios. But this could be added as a future responsibility to a different team. In terms of use case, I believe it would be helpful to the instructors in assigning a grade.</p>",,,1,"<p>Apart from the issue that the Travis CI build is failing, they have produced a neat and understandable code. If they can overcome the issue that would be really great. I would add more comments in case if this project will be continued by members who have not worked on this. Even if the same team or same members are continuing the project, it is always a good idea to add comments for better readability and understanding of code.</p>",,,1,"<p>The build did not pass and there are a multitude, about 90 issues with Code Climate. Ultimately I think these things need ti be fixed because it is general style guidelines that should be followed.</p>",,,1,"<p>The Travis CI build could not complete due to an error. No conflicts are found but there are a lot of problems indicated by Code Climate such as instances of identical blocks of code, blocks with high number of lines, etc. The team should follow the guidlines suggested by Code Climate to fix these.</p>",,,1,"<p>The build request did not pass, and the codeclimate does indicate alot of issues, my suggestion would be to use ruby mine options of refactoring before push. Please look into the issue with Gem file</p>",,,1,"<p>I checked that Travis CI build does not pass for their new pull request. I further investigated on why it is not passing and found that they are trying to run install commands in deployment which seems to be the major issue why the build is not passing. This issue can be solved either by finding another way to resolve dependencies before the deployment mode. I would first search what would be the ideal way to install dependencies and if not, ask mentors on how to solve this. This does not seem to be a big deal as fas as the code is concerned, there are no issues there.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>There is no pull request present.

I think the authors can use mockups for better explaining their project.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>There are no tests section present in their wiki. I believe this project doesnt need any testing section.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The authors of the design doc adequately explained the changes that needed to be made. Most of the explanation was similar to the first iteration of the design doc, but even the first iteration of the design doc did a good job of explaining what needed to be done.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I understood the design plan, and I think it is straightforward enough that others will think the same too.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design seems simple and&nbsp;clear to understand. The fact the the authors included a flowchart made me understand the approach very quickly.</p>,,,1,"<p>The visual in the design doc, which is a flowchart that describes task 2 of the project (Compare the resulting screenshots and report the contents of the generated page if the screenshots differ), made it very easy to understand how the authors were going to approach the problem.</p>",,,1,"<p>This project includes a test plan that the authors laid out at the end of the ""Work to be Done"" section. For each step that is laid out in the project spec, a testing procedure was described. The tests described in the design doc are not shallow and will test functionality that is essential for this project.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, yes they have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They go into great detail about what work they will do.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a bit more information about what the system is, though. The only real information about the existing system is ""<a class=""external text"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_(layout_engine)"" rel=""nofollow"">Servo</a> is experimental web browser developed by Mozilla to ""to create a new layout engine using a modern programming language"". By automating servo (the web browser) we were able to quickly see if servo could render the randomly generated pages.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't even say which ""modern programming language"" it is!</p>",,,-1,"<p>It wasn't really designed by the team as much as Mozilla, so, yeah, it does just fine.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It wasn't really designed by the team as much as Mozilla, so, yeah, it does just fine.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the team has done an adequate job explaining the changes to be made to the system.&nbsp; The team has added to their design since the last time I reviewed them, and I am pleased to see that they added a new diagram describing the system they will be working on at a high level.&nbsp; The diagram looks great and is super helpful in understanding what is going on!</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design appears to be sound.&nbsp; The team seems to be following appropriate principles, but does not specify a specific design pattern.&nbsp; This might be helpful to add in the future, but the team as a whole seems to have a great understanding of the systems design and what they need to do to complete the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a geat job creating a simple system that appears to cover the entire scope of the project.&nbsp; The team has displayed a strong understanding of their projects scope, and what needs to be done.&nbsp; Though the use of text and diagrams, the team has reiterated what each step in their plan of action is for, and how it relates to the project as a whole.&nbsp; All in all, great job!</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a great job integrating figures into their design document.&nbsp; This is something I thought was lacking when I first reviewed their work, but they have addressed this problem nicely in their final write up.&nbsp; The team has provided a simple, easy to read flow diagram describing the system as a whole.&nbsp; One item I would definitely suggest adding though, is&nbsp; UML diagram.&nbsp; For documentation on creating UML diagrams checkout this&nbsp;wiki article that I think is really good and helpful:&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language</p>
<p>Other then that, great job!</p>",,,1,"<p>The team does include a test plan.&nbsp; It appears from their description, that it is not necessary for them to write tests for their given project as it will be obvious as to whether or not it will work. That being said, if the project only needs to be ""visually"" verified, it might be nice to have some form of selenium tests written to automate this validation.&nbsp; I am not very familiar with the Mozilla project or the Rust language, so selenium tests might not apply, but here is a helpful resource to look at if you think automating some webrouser tests might be helpful. https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/01_introducing_selenium.jsp</p>
<p>Other then that, great job!</p>",,,1,<p>The authors have explained the project well. The design document included the previous work and the changes that need to be done for the next work. The authors have taken enough effort to make the design document easy to understand. The team could have used more visual aids that would add to the explanation of the project.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>The design appears to be sound with all the required information about the project. It contained the details about the previous work and work to be done now. It has all appropriate principles and patterns. It is complete and may include some use of visual aids to make it much better. It could also include the testing plan which is highly appreciated.</p>,,,1,<p>The design appears to be simple and easy to understand by a normal user. The team could have made use of more visual aids to make it more appealing. The team could also include the test plan.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>There is no class diagram in the design document. The visual aids in the design document is a screenshot. These figures are contextual and relevant to the explanation. The screenshot clearly demonstrates the previous work. Use of more visual aids is greatly encouraged as it would make the design document easy to understand.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>The design document did not include the test plan. Including a test plan in design document is greatly encouraged. The test cases must also be included in the test plan. This would improve the coverage of your project and hence will improve the range of the project.</p>,,,1,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"">Clean UI, Login page is neatly designed.

<p>in the proposed implementation: i do have doubt regarding what if one&nbsp;student&nbsp;is doing multiple things&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the files to be modified, it would have been better to include what changes should there be in each file, would give better idea as to why these files need to be modified.</p>
<p>Test plan should be more elaborate: testing before submitting project all the students should have some role</p>

It included all the major details such as project purpose, design(with UML diagram and list of files to be added/modified) and a tentative test plan. The proposed implementation was also explained clearly and the team seems to have a clear idea about how to go about with the project. I liked how they had posed implementation questions in the end of the document and these are probably to be answered as they proceed with the project. I am reducing a point only because a couple of mock-ups would've been perfect additions to this document.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Well after checking the specification provided for the project, it can be clearly observed that the team has covered all the required functionality in the documentation.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It does indeed do that.

I think this is good because UML diagrams are great to model systems and flow of information or data. After they describe the problem statement, they then go into an explanation of each problem and show their planned implementation, or potential mock-ups of what the views could look like to implement the features outlined. They also have the test plan section with several good possible tests they could write to ensure a functional design.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design doc is complete.

Use Case diagram is very useful in this situation especially since there are multiple contexts that are used such as the difference between a student and instructor and the operations they are allowed to perform. I think this has all the necessary sections to achieve full points. I would recommend better formatting for the Test plan section instead of a numbered list, but I do not think that this alone should cost you any points. You could achieve this by making a table or using the wiki formatting syntax to make it appear cleaner.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Extra information : it has been specifically written not to write about expertiza</p>

They make use of images to good effect. The only issue I see is that they are missing a few key sections. I see that the views affected are mentioned, however consider adding the controllers and methods that would be added/changed. Also, there is redundant information on what Expertiza is whereas it was mentioned not to include these details.</p>",,,-1,"<p>This wiki page seems contains all the content needed. They introduce the project purpose and their design. Also they use some image and diagram to show the work in details.

They do show a lot of pictures of mock-up UI changes, which is very good because in this case it makes it almost self explanatory.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Overall, the proposed changes are well explained to me. Well done. However, the part where it mentions ""Approval of badges by instructor"" is not so clear me. It introduces a concept ""student-suggested badges"". I don't know where and how a student could suggest a badge for certain submission for a assignment. Is it about the badges assigned to the teammates?</p>",,,-1,<p>The explanations are easy to follow as they are supplemented by screenshots too.</p>,,,-1,<p>Almost all of the issues has a pictoral description to elucidate the point.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>All the explanations of their changes are well-written and easy to follow.

They just need to be able to coordinate the adding of all of those selections to different views and control their actions. I think any implementation could make the code ""smelly"", but they should be careful to not put too much code into the views. It does seem that it may be better for them to consider even extra implementation since modifying a few views seems like a fairly narrow scope, but overall their ideas seem logical and coherent.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors haven't stated any code changes as of now.</p>,,,-1,<p>I think the designs would not cause any of the problems mentioned above.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The above listed problems do not exist with the design. The design seems clean, as seen from the multiple screenshots posted. I don't think the design can be simplified further. I think all the changes they have proposed are necessary.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Their goal is to extend badging functionality and they will mainly add 4 new functionalities about badging, so I think they may increase the response time but it's inevitable. For example, the functionality that students are entitled to assign badges may slightly increase the time of loading pages.</p>",,,1,"<p>For the most part, the design looks good. The only thing that is missing is the UML diagrams or some model of the code that will be modified. I cannot check if the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class because I do not know anything about the code. However, aside from that issue, everything looks great! You tell us what files you are modifying on the front-end, but not on the back end with the database, which I imagine would be the more challenging portion. Please include that in the next iteration.</p>",,,1,"<p>In some cases it is mentioned which files would be changed but they are only related to view, it would have been beneficial to have included changes in controller as well.</p>
<p>In ""assignment of good reviewer"" its very difficult to just know a column by icon, usually if the space is very small it makes sense to have icon, but in this case it would be better to have written text.</p>",,,1,"<p>Though the files that will be changed are mentioned, a high-level overview of what code changes need to be made to these files is not given. It is suggested that this section be added.</p>",,,1,"<p>Some more effort should be expended on the design. There can be a section explaining the different designs that the team/ authors came across while&nbsp;deciding on the one they are going with, these could be explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The changes proposed are mostly to be implemented on the View side and hence I don't think there is anything too complicated or something that could increase the response time of the system. The team has mostly figured out as to where the changes need to be made. However, knowing what controller changes would be made would be helpful to know as to whether it would be efficient. Also, make sure the icons used are open source and do not have any copyright infringement associated.</p>",,,-1,"<p>i didn't see anything that going to be a problem in their right now plan. But one thing they might need to pay attention is when they modified the origin files, they should avoid collision with other related files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The UML diagram shows pretty well the exchange of data. It illustrates how instructors control creating and assigning badges, viewing badges assigned to students and approving badges. Then students can assign badges and view the badges they have received. Also their other diagrams show pretty clearly how they plan on updating the UI to enable these implementations.</p>",,,-1,<p>All the diagrams are helpful in making me understand the project.</p>,,,1,"<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>- Add UML diagram.</p>",,,1,"<p>The ""approval of badges"" should have been presented with an image to get an idea what and how the changes are to be reflected.</p>",,,1,"<p>They have made a cool usecase diagram which I think is very helpful for readers to understand the newly-added expertiza badging structure. But I guess there's a little problem with this diagram: ""View badges received"" should read data from the database instead of writing data to the database, so I think the arrow is backwards. Also, I'd mention a little advice even though it wasn't mentioned in the requirements:&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be better if they could illustrate (maybe not in this diagram) what other roles can do with badging (such as admin) rather than just instructor and student.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Use of mock-ups is excellent, and are necessary. I think the explanations could be slightly improved, but I addressed this in previous feedback.

<p>Also this team has mentioned the changes that they need to make in detail but have not mentioned the files that needs to be changed. This would make it easier for the reader to gauge these changes and see if they are accurate or not.</p>
<p>Thus, I would suggest to add a test plan explaining in detail the proposed testing methodology and include the files to be changed with a brief explanation of changes in each file.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document is very well written. The problem statement and suggested solutions were described in detail. In addition, screenshots of the issues were put in place, which helped provide context and visualize the problem.

Apart from that, the authors have done a flawless job.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have done a great job explaining the intent of the project. The screenshots and descriptions are very helpful. The only improvement I can suggest is to segregate the sections properly. At the moment, the ""present scenario"" and ""proposed implementation"" are mixed up. The authors need to separate these into different sections.</p>
<p>Secondly, the proposed implementation should also contain details of the application files (views/models etc) that needs changing.</p>
<p>Third, the authors need to add a ""Test Plan"" section and describe the same.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document provides in depth details about the current issues and things to be implemented which is good. They make use of images to good effect. The only issue I see is that they are missing a few key sessions.

<p>They have tried to implement all the functionalities to their best</p>",,,1,"<p>Looks like the project has lot of changes to be made in the system and the team has carefully noted them and included in the design document. Team has worked really hard in making sure not to miss out any details. Good work.</p>
<p>In review report, right from adding metrics to the review report, adding background color to the sorted table, adding colors to the reviewers the team has taken time to explain the details with screenshots.</p>
<p>In the Review summary page, the header changes, ui changes to the question, checkbox questions are all explained well with appropriate screenshots.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design doc incorporates all the functionalities that are required to be implemented for this project.

<p>Just one suggestion , the project requirement states that in the review report , the course name and the student name must be shown as correctly it does not display that. This part has not been clearly stated in the doc but rather implied. It would be better if this is also stated as a goal and implementation steps are shown for it in the next submission.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design appears to have incorporated all of the functionality they needed to. The team also was able to seperate the long paragraphs that the requirements were written in into clear action items, each with a detailed description of the problem, a picture to depict it, and what the planned changes are.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The design plan completely covers all of the functionality required in the problem description.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the design doc covers every aspect of the project. The team has provided a highly detailed view of what the project is and what should be expected of it.</p>",,,1,<p>Yes.

They could improve this by separating their documentation into mode logical sections than it is now.</p>,,,-1,"<p>As far the functionality goes, the design doc covers it and it seems to include all details no matter how small. I couldn't find anything that is missing based on the requirement spec. So, well done!</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes! Everything seems to be included.&nbsp; I like how you included screenshots just like in the spec of the projects.&nbsp; Helps convey info better!</p>,,,-1,"<p>I like how you explain the reasoning behind fixes as you describe the proposed implemented solutions. It seems that you all have really divided up the tweaks and improvements well, that they seem to be quite modular and all small chunks that are quite manageable, so good job! Overall, i still think it may seem a bit too cluttered and maybe just that small summary of all of the improvements before the design section could help out.</p>",,,1,"<p>The explanations for the changes proposed are good and makes the reviewer understand what needs to be done but I feel the explanations that are provided do not answer the question ""how it is going to be achieved?"".

<p>Each of the sub modules are well explained and it is very intuitive for even a new person who does not know the application to understand.</p>",,,-1,"<p>All the explanations are easy to understand and follow. The changes mentioned could be understood by anyone who doesn't have any prior knowledge on the system. Good work team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important part is that they have explained everything in detail with all the necessary supporting examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes made in the Review Summary Page like changes in Header, where the team is trying to figure out fixing whitespace is not clear to me.

On top of being documented with a problem statement (in those where its necessary) and picture, the specific improvements for the changes are provided as well. I would say the only issue is that some of the suggested changes are in bulleted points, and those lack some of the explanation that other changes have. I would suggest splitting all of the suggested changes into bullet points to increase readability, but to keep the level of detail (or add in cases where needed like in the <strong>Checkbox questions</strong> section).</p>",,,1,<p>All of the changes were well explained.&nbsp; More details about exactly what needs to change will probably be added as they get into the code more.</p>,,,-1,<p>The changes that the authors have proposed are easy to understand.

It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly. The only thing I felt inadequate was that there's no mention about the potential files and/or functions they would have to change to implement the requirements. Including these give a feel that the team has been thorough and have a solid foundation to work on.</p>,,,1,<p>Explanation of each change is very good and detail - I really like the screenshots.&nbsp; I do think you need a better introduction explaining things.&nbsp; Just go into a little more detail about what expertiza is and what you're trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>On the add metrics chart section, I think it would be helpful if you would at least show a mock-up to illustrate the type of graph you expect you will produce. That way as a reader, we can understand the certain contribution and how helpful this will end up being. Other than that I think the design looks well constructed. I would perhaps be specific in which files you plan on editing to perhaps get a better look at the specifics, so we understand where you will have to be careful and to ensure you have thought the design through well enough.</p>",,,1,<p>The wiki doesn't introduce how to achieve all the functionality in detail. But some of them are good.</p>,,,1,"<p>As I mentioned earlier, for all the proposed changes the authors have not mentioned what files will need modification and what files may be added so I cannot make a comment about the problems mentioned in the question.</p>",,,1,"<p>I did not find a section where the classes, models, controllers or views that would be impacted were listed.</p>
<p>They could have listed it in a separate section so that they could have been visible properly</p>",,,1,"<p>For the scope of their project the implementation the team has planned looks good to me. Most of the changes are in the UI part (View file, CSS changes) so they need to make sure they coordinate all the sections to different views and control the specific actions. It looks like the changes for the system doesn't require any additional gem so the implementation decision is correct. The team should have minimum code in the view so that it doesn't increase the response time of the system.</p>
<p>Any of the implementation could make the code smelly so the team has to be careful in not putting too much logic into the view which is the standard followed. Optional additional improvements have also been given which is good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>This team has proposed a good plan of action for solving the problems given to them. The HTML and CSS implementation for altering the tables and cleaning up the whitespaces has been explained in great detail by this team. However , regarding the other implementation planned, the team has not included any explanation of how they will bring about the said changes or what files they did to edit to make the said changes. they ha</p>",,,1,"<p>The designs appear to be sound. There are no apparent code smells, and, while there was a lack of designs/mockups, it is clear that the proposed changes aren't too complicated. However, the team did not indicate which files and classes they are going to change, so it is unclear whether or not unecessary or out of place code is going to be added.</p>",,,1,<p>There is a focus on reusing code wherever possible including utilizing gems.&nbsp; The changes should simplify the layouts which should only help the response time.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design that the authors have proposed seems apt. There are no potential flaws in the design. They have done a great job of explaining everything in detail.</p>,,,1,"<p>The authors have not mentioned about the code changes in the proposed implementation. They need to mention the code changes&nbsp;required and the entities that they wish to add or reuse. Again, this needs to be mentioned in a ""proposed implementation"" section.</p>",,,1,"<p>The changes proposed are mostly to be implemented on the View side and hence I don't think there is anything too complicated or something that could increase the response time of the system. The team has mostly figured out as to where the changes need to be made. However, it would be helpful for the reviewer to know where they intend to make these changes.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Overall, I do not think any of the proposed changes are ""smelly"" or will cause problems.&nbsp; They are all sensible changes that make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The mock-ups provided look good, but what I notice is they seem to essentially all be the same as the ones provided in the requirements document. Where this ok right at the beginning, it doesn't seem to show any editing to indicate your specific contribution. I would urge you to consider showing by some fashion how your contribution will improve expertiza. A simple mock-up is alright, at least something that illustrates each change you plan on making. Also perhaps you should show a UML diagram showing some sort of flow of information that represents what your project aims to do and the problem it aims to solve.</p>",,,-1,<p>All the visual aids are necessary. Show the functionalities directly.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The diagrams provided by the author gives the reader an idea about how the pages look currently and allows the reader see what the proposed changes will do to these pages when incorporated.

<p>All the diagrams are useful, to the point, succinct and follow the conventions.</p>
<p>The high level diagrams are also to the point</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has given number of screenshots to help in understanding the project/problem statement. All of the mockups are necessary and they aid in the changes the team has proposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no specific UML diagram given, according to their course of implementation i believe that is not necessary and mandatory in understanding the functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>This team has included a couple of screenshot images to aid the understanding of their ideas. They have done a good job. The diagrams included in the wiki makes it clear what problems persist in the views of response report and summary report and it also assists the reviewers in visualizing the changes that the team has proposed. However, the diagrams included only consists of the images of the existing views. It would have been better if the team would have added visual representation of their implementation in some form, maybe even a hand drawn view with the proposed changes would have also sufficed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The doc does not contain any UML, but given the facts that the changes this team intends to make are only in the views, so I believe a UML is not required as such to show the implementation.</p>
<p>Thus, for your next submission , make sure you include diagrams of how the views would look after the proposed changes have been implementation . This would make your goals absolutely clear to the reviewers instead of just describing it in words.</p>",,,1,"<p>The visual aids are used to illustrate the problems and serve their purpose well. However, I would suggest a design mockup to be made either on paper, whiteboard, or wireframing software. These types of pictures will help visualize how the changes will affect the application and allow for reviewers to spot potential problems and suggest changes to the design.</p>",,,1,<p>Visual aids were helpful in describing what the issues were. Could be helpful in some of the cases to see a representation of what the finished product could look like.&nbsp; The css changes could be quickly mocked up by editing the css directly in the rendered webpage.</p>,,,1,<p>They have provided adequate visual aids. There is no apparent need for a UML diagram. They have provided a whole lot of screen shots to help make things easier. I would have loved if the authors had added some screen mock ups to help make things more clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>The authors have done a great job adding all the required screenshots in the documentation.

<p>However, they have given an overview of the implementation and have not provided a lot of details about the implementation.

For example, the test ""computes and returns scores"" contains many assertions, and uses several variables defined outside the method which are not clearly related to that specific test.</p>",,,-1,<p>The Travis CI build passes.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The tests added slightly increase the overall project coverage, dramatically improve the coverage of the class under test, and all pass.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It is not clear that these tests coverall many edge cases or invalid inputs.

They had issues with model in the first phase which seem to be corrected now&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>A good number of coomits were seen to be done for the 2nd round</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes the build passed and there were no conflicts</p>,,,-1,<p>The coverage is seen to increase and it is shown that 92% coverage was reached by the team . The team did a very good job&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The test cases cover all the functions to be tested in the model file .&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The write up was pretty much in detail of what was being tested . The team wrote about finctionality of different functions in the model file and then wrote the corresponding tests</p>,,,-1,<p>The code is seen to be complete and could be deployed&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>I think there are just a couple ways to DRY out their code, where some of the assignments were done when they could have been done in one before(;each) block before all of the tests. the allow, expect style is well done and the kind of style which makes it easier to see what you are testing. In general this could have potentially been done in a more DRY fashion, which what that really does is make it easier for those in the future to use.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, several new commits were added between submissions.</p>",,,1,"<p>The build did pass, but there are 80 conflicts with Code Climate. A lot of these issues seem rather trivial and easy to fix, simply being stylistic problems, such as extra spacing or indentation here, or extra line there. These things are so simple to fix I don't think they pose much of a problem.</p>",,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;They did add test cases, as that seems to be the crux of this project. They were able to increase the test coverage to 92% which is pretty impressive and good, such that the Expertiza team will have a good level of assurance that the code that was tested does what it should do and doesn't break other areas of Expertiza. They cover the whole range of what on_the_fly_calc does, especially to receive such a high amount of coverage as a result.</p>",,,-1,"<p>As a testing project, this implementation works very well to nearly exhaustively test the model! Through the video they show, there are a few methods not tested by the spec file, but most of the aspects of the code are, and so I think they did a great job in this regard!</p>",,,-1,"<p>I think the writeup is very thorough and explains their thought process well. This type of design, where they explain the problems, proposed solutions, and the reasoning as to what led them to the solution is very easy to follow. I like how the were essentially having a conversation with the reviewer and instructors and whoever else may be reading the document.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>There are some minor issues with Code Climate but besides that I do think this is ready to be deployed, as their video and results show, they have increased coverage from 0% to 92.74%, which is quite commendable. They achieved their goal and thoroughly tested a model to be integrated into the production server. Seeing as this what such a successful project, perhaps a future team could be made to do a similar project, where they thoroughly test other models or controllers that are in need of such test coverage.</p>",,,-1,"<p>In the companies _form view there is a long list of options to select that are placed on subsequent lines and im unsure if thus would count as good practice. I dont know if the good coding practices include the logical if statement within the jobs index view page, as this sort of style is well known to be used in other languages such as Java or C. Throughout the models, there seems to be a great use of ancestry to create the relationships that make the MVC idea work well. Within the controllers, i can see that you all used the relationships between the controllers and views well, to create the logic for searching through the list of jobs in the jobs_controller ruby file.</p>
<p>After looking through all of the project, I think you all showed pretty good instances of rails design, though im unsure of a few matters. Truth be told, i think my group did a similar type of if conditional, just wondering myself if a better option is available.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows good ruby and rails coding practices. They have maintained the required MVC structure.</p>,,,1,"<p>They create really similar models and similar controllers. Controllers, like admin, job seeker, recruiter could be just one controller. Models, too, like, auser, ruser, user, jobseeker, recruiter, admin could be just one model.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code for the most part follows good coding practices.The code is clearly written and is easy to understand for the most part.However, the use of comments especially for non-scaffold generated methods will help the user to understand the code much better. For eg:- filter function in the jobs controller.</p>
<p>Some of the empty-body methods can be written in a single line For eg:- ""show"" and ""edit"" method in users_controller. In the applications controller, there are parameters ""j_id"" and ""job_id"" which is slightly confusing.</p>
<p>Also, there are two controllers application_controller for authorization of users and applications_controller which handles CRUD methods for job applications. You could name it differently to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Methods for destroying and closing an application have been defined in the Model ""application.rb"" and similarly, in the Job Model file ""job.rb"" This negates the use of MVC architecture where the controller controls the interpretation of actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The last time, when I checked the deployed app on 03/05/2018, the app was not working. However,it seems to be working fine now.</p>
<p>The layout of the app is clean and simple and easy to follow. There was no confusion in navigating the app. However, it took quite some time to enter the address in proper format. Same goes for the website and revenue while creating a company. You may put a sample address and phone number in the README if you are strictly restricting the format. When applying for a job as a job-seeker, the error prompt for the portfolio format says that it should be of the form http(s)://www.website.com/org/etc however it only accepts the format http(s)://www.website.com. The same issue arised while creating a company while signed in as a recruiter.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the README file is very detailed and helps the user to understand the working of the app very well. It could be a little brief or be displayed as bullet points instead of paragraphs to make it easier to read.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>No testing has been performed for any of the models or controllers.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, there have been constant commits throughout the duration of the project as well as after the submission date. In fact most of the commits have been made around the deadline and after it.</p>",,,-1,<p>Everything a user could see (job applications/jobs/companies) could also be edited by adding /edit to the url even though the edit button was hidden. A jobseeker could also add companies and jobs by adding /new to the url. This means the controller wasn't doing the same validation checks that the view was.</p>,,,1,"<p>&nbsp;The radio button on the bottom made it easy to switch between roles.&nbsp; An improvement could be recruiters being able to view job applications for a specific job.&nbsp; If they are viewing a job, they should be able to view its applications.&nbsp; It's ok as is in this system, but in a larger system with a lot of applications, a recruiter would want to be able to go from a job to its applications directly.</p>",,,-1,<p>&nbsp;The application controller and model was tested well with RSpec.</p>,,,-1,<p>&nbsp;There weren't many commits before the first deadline but they committed frequently between that deadline and the final submission.</p>,,,-1,<p>looks pretty good.</p>,,,-1,<p>readme file is very detailed. it's easy to see that they spend some time working on it. just still can't log in with the account in readme file on the cloud platform.</p>,,,-1,<p>they did the rspec test. and seems did lots of works.</p>,,,-1,<p>almost 100 commits done by three people. they did a good job.</p>,,,-1,<p>The code is easy to understand and follows the good Rails coding practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The UI is very user friendly and intuitive. Navigation through the pages is effortless and very much sticks to the norms of what is considered an intuitive UI. There is hardly any need to go through the readme to understand what the system does as it is very obvious. Also, the readme, although not required to understand how to go about interacting with the system, is very descriptive and covers all the aspects of the system.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has tested the companies and applications model thoroughly.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the commits have been fairly regular throughout the term of the project. All three members have been active throughout the project.</p>",,,-1,<p>Readme is well described. But the sample accounts are not working.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>Didn't find any tests written.</p>,,,-1,<p>A lot of commits done&nbsp;but all of them in the last 3-4 days of the deadline.</p>,,,1,"<p>The code looks great.

They have drop-down lists whenever it's useful and appropriate, which makes it easier to choose, not typing. They also added&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;additional instructions on their UI in README, which could be a bit shorter.&nbsp;There is one suggestion I would give to the team&nbsp;that would probably improve the UI: -Putting&nbsp;""home page"" and ""log out"" buttons in the upper right corner, which would&nbsp;make them more visually noticeable, and prevent an accidental log out case.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">I went through spec folder, and found some RSpec&nbsp;tests.

The specific actions that team will take for each of these changes are explicitly outlined and the scope of their changes is very apparent. I would suggest that the team be more specific with regards to which files will be modified and, perhaps also use a few visual aids such as mockups to illustrate some of the visual portions of their proposed changes (e.g. how the differences between rendered web pages will be indicated).</p>",,,1,"<p>The explanation is easy to follow just by reading the code.

<p>However, devise authentication hasn't been used the way it should have. Roles should be used to manage access to certain pages. Even a recruiter can view all users of the application via the url. Also, there is some redundancy in the code like creating multiple views for each user when it could have been done using one.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Y'all seemed to use good ruby conventions/practices including the model-view-controller architecture and the coding syntax.&nbsp; In addition you had a large number of commits from different people. You did not use the ""issues"" tab from git but I don't view that as a necessity but it would have been nice to have (still gave you full points).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The UI is rather understandable, though i'm not sure what happened with the Job Seeker functionality. Perhaps it wasn't able to get working, but it doesnt seem like they can do anything but edit their profile from what i saw. Other than that, I had no trouble, and i like the way you all listed the actions that could be taken down the page. It made it easy to locate the option i was looking for, as well as telling me who was logged in at the top of the page.</p>",,,-1,<p>The user interface is quite user friendly and display all the required information. Although for the Job seeker the views lack certain links apart from that everything else works just fine.</p>,,,1,"<p>The user interface is a little bit confusing. Especially the part, where admin creates new jobseeker or new recruiter, who is actually logged in at the end? Both the admin and new created user?</p>
<p>And it seems like when admin creates job seeker, the email in the job seeker's profile is not the one admin just used to create the account.</p>
<p>README helps a bit. Just feel it is an interesting design choice.</p>
<p>I think it is because of the cross model visits. The same link would trigger different behaviors. (such as if admin creates a recruiter, and tries to create another one, it won't go back to the signin page anymore, it will just go to recruiters/new). Here is a solution I found (point 6):</p>
<p>https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-to-Setup-Multiple-Devise-User-Models</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for a job seeker to be able to view companies and jobs, he needs to type in the url by himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>There is no user interface. There are links to perform actions. The user interface could have been much better.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>I tried to login as an admin, but I got the error below. I also got the same error when I tried to sign up as either a recruiter or a job seeker. As a result, I could not test this app well. However, from the looks of it, the UI seems to be a little too complicated. For example, there are 5 links on the login screen, each of which allows the user to login as an admin/recruiter/job seeker or sign up as a recruiter/job seeker. This seems excessive and the code could definitely made more DRY.</p>

I'm not sure if they considered how they would test different cases, but I would certainly start to consider the possibilities as if the contribution isn't tested well enough, it may break other areas of the project and they won't integrate your contributions. Simply put, you can start by testing the basic functionality works assuming everything is correct. Then you could move to other cases, like what happens if it tries to pull a submitted review that has been deleted by either the user or an instructor? I would certainly urge them to think about testing and their testing plan, because in my opinion testing is just about more important than the new contribution, because if it breaks old code, then the project didn't accomplish anything to be worked around.</p>",,,1,<p>Testing is not included in the writeup.

Also, i'm not sure if the first or second 'task to be completed' are complete, because there is only the third task referenced on the page. So in summary, I would say try to explain your contribution with plenty of pictures as if you were explaining the project to any random person.

I'm not exactly sure how to review the javascript that was written, but for the ruby code it does follow convention. I do notice in app/views/sample_submissions/_general.html.erb that there seems to be a lot of logic contained within the view that could be moved into the controller. In general you want to use the view for very limited logic and just to control how something looks, where the controller decided what is shown. The same is true of the app/views/sample_submissions/_responses.html.erb. I would say the index.html.erb file was done better, but in general try to design the system such that minimal use of logic in the view is achieved.

There are lots of commits made (40 commits) which shows they have been pushing the changes then and there to the master.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, it seems the majority of commits were made between the first and second round of submissions. Several of these commits seemed geared towards solving code climate issues and ensuring that the build passes Travis CI. The team did a good job of evenly dividing the commits between members, and a great job of committing changes early and often. The only suggestion I have is maybe more explicit commit messages.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the code was regularly committed.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. A lot of new commits after 1st round.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, it says that 20 commits were added between the first and second submissions, which is good that it basically means that functionality was improved.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes the team did add test cases. I believe the coverage may have decreased by 1%. From what i see in the sample_submissions_controller_spec.rb file, it seems to be mainly the scaffold created result, where there is not much&nbsp; more coverage as to the functionality they included for the views they added. There are some capybara tests which test the view that is good, but I believe that further testing could have been done on the controller.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes. Test cases were added. I would think the coverage increased.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">They used capybara to test the views they created. I think it is thorough.</span></p>",,,-1,<p>This is not a testing project and test cases to check the fun</p>,,,-1,"<p>They added tests cases to test their code. While it seems that it covers things well they never talk about if the test cases pass or what the coverage is. However, I think that could be out of the scope of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The pull request does not state anything about the coverage. But the team has added test cases. They have made use of rspec capybara. The cases considered seem to cover a good scope of the implemented functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion: They could have added screenshots of the results of running the tests which shows whether they pass.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>New tests were added to test the functionality of sample submissions, but I can't tell if their coverage increased and how it covered the range of this project as their coverage for these tests are not mentioned in their writeup.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes , the team has added test cases in this submission. I cannot see the coverall coverage report. This may be due the fact that the build has failed. Thus , i cannot comment if the coverage has increased or no. The test scenarios added are pretty exhaustive and cover most of the scenarios. Maybe more test cases merging the single scenarios can be made. This should cover all the conner cases.</p>
<p>I believe screenshot of Rspec results could have been included in the wiki.</p>",,,-1,<p>Lots of test cases are added in sample_submission_controller_test and rspec&nbsp;is written in sample_submission_spec. These test cases cover most of the feature.</p>,,,-1,<p>The team added several test cases and the test coverage does increase. The writeup does a great job of covering the test cases that were added and the tools used to create those test cases. Capybara was used to check the UI results of actions taken on their system.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>Everything seems to work well.&nbsp; I did not exhaustively test everything (probably out of the scope of the review) but in the tests that I ran everything worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The UI operations work as expected. Though not a testing project, the authors have included tests to verify their functionality.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Everything works as intended, but I had some difficulty making sure that the sample submissions were actually being displayed for the correct student.&nbsp; Nonetheless, great job on the UI ya'll!</p>",,,-1,"<p>Everything works fine on the UI. The guide to UI test this manually is pretty descriptive and detailed. It makes it easy to test. All the functionality proposed by these authors have been implemented and runs without errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though not required, this team has added tests to make their code full proof which is a good practice.</p>",,,-1,<p>I was unable to access the AWS deployment so I attempted to test in my personal environment. After pulling the repo and building as normal I ran into several errors and was unable to test the functionality. I would leave the stars section blank but I cannot seem to remove my rating for some reason.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>From the screenshot, it is seen that the functionality&nbsp;is well implemented both from student view and from instructor view.<br />A screencast could have been attached to verify the flow.</p>",,,1,"<p>From my first review, I remember they still had quite a few aspects to explain through well, like the testing area. They certainly improved upon the readability of their document! They have a nice graphic that explains the couple of different control paths that were created and improved upon, which helped me to test out the deployed application. They clearly laid out the project tasks they had set out to accomplish, which is a nice touch. They then separated by each task and showed the code they added to accomplish said procedure, which i like because it gives an organization that is easy to follow as viewer. They have a clearly laid out test plan section where they show the test situations they added in RSpec. This is good, but perhaps it would be better if they would explain their reasoning behind the tests, which i feel would be more representative of a test&nbsp;<em>plan</em>, rather than show the test implementation right off the bat. They end on a future scope which is a great idea because it makes it slightly easier for the instructors.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The improved the writeup a lot since last review. Now it is really easy to understand, especially with flow chart.</p>",,,-1,<p>The write up could have been better. Any new reviewer should be able to seamlessly able to navigate to the exact part of the codes where changes have been made</p>,,,1,"<p>The writeup is descriptive and well written. The project objective and the proposed solution has been clearly stated. They have added snippets and explained them which is an improvement from the last submission. This has made the wiki a lot easier to understand. The test plan section has been included with detailed descriptions of the different testing scenarios and the corresponding spec snippets have also been added. It would have been better to include the screenshots of the Rspec results.</p>
<p>Adding comments to the code would have been beneficial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup is very well written with the flow, steps, test cases, well described. The flow is neatly drawn with what is to be expected. The file changes are also described for every file.<br />Files modified/attached section could have been added because lots of files have been modified. So files modified and files added section would make it easy to understand.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup was very well written, the flowcharts for both user types at the beginning was a very nice touch. The sections are divided well and each one is explained in an easy to understand manner. They are not too verbose, but not terse either. The minus 1 is for the things. The developed code sections feels slightly redundant as you included the pull request at the bottom, a reviewer can check the pull request rather than read the wiki. This also introduces potential for version control error, so I would recommend sticking to just the git. The second is there is no explicit mention of design patterns.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The writeup is amazing! I really liked the graphics that helped explained everything.&nbsp; While it probably could have been explained in words, the pictures really helped make things clearer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The writeup is quite descriptive. It contains explanation regarding the project issues. The authors have included code snippets which makes it easier for the reader to follow the changes made in the code. They could have included explanation regarding why the changes were made by adding a few comments. They have included a Test Plan stating all the test cases considered, they can also add a screenshot of the test passing so that the readers know that all the tests work.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup looks great and I was able to understand what your project is suppose to do.&nbsp; One of the highlights that I thought strengthen your writeup was your use of diagrams and pictures to show the flow of how students are able to make their assignment public and how they are able to view sample submissions based on what an instructors makes public for students.&nbsp; The only thing that I think it lacks in is direction of how to guide the reviewer on how to test your application.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, when a reviewer wants to test your deployed application, which student/instructor should they log in as to ensure that what they see matches what your sample submission pictures in the writeup.</p>",,,1,"<p>One concern I have is that the Gemfile.lock file is conflicting with the current expertiza repo, which could be concerning. If they used things in a different way than other aspects of the code base, then perhaps it could break those aspects for the entire system. I do think this is a good starting place though, because they definitely seem to have done great work! I do think the views should be limited in the inclusion of logic, and they were not quite aligned with this though, but other than that they wrote fairly well styled code. Testing-wise it could be taken as a slight concern when considering how well the paths were justified, as it seems the test coverage may have decreased slightly.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I am not quite sure about this.</p>
<p>One thing is, for an instructor to select past assignment as a sample, it seems like all the assignment with valid course id would all show up in the list.</p>
<p>Does this mean every instructor would have accesses to all the assignments in the database? Is this an issue or my understanding is not correct?</p>
<p>Another thing is, could we improve this by providing a search function to search relevant assignments not listing all the available ones&nbsp;</p>

Use Case diagram is very useful in this situation especially since there are multiple contexts that are used such as the difference between a student and instructor and the operations they are allowed to perform. I think this has all the necessary sections to achieve full points.

I think that your explanation should not rely too heavily on the visualization where possibly. Try to add more depth to the explanation if possible because you cannot always count on someone understanding your&nbsp;screen mock-ups.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>For the most part, the design looks good. The only thing that is missing is the UML diagrams or some model of the code that will be modified. I cannot check if the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class because I do not know anything about the code. However, aside from that issue, everything looks great! You tell us what files you are modifying on the front-end, but not on the back end with the database, which I imagine would be the more challenging portion. Please include that in the next iteration.</p>",,,1,"<p>Use of mock-ups is excellent, and are necessary. I think the explanations could be slightly improved, but I addressed this in previous feedback. The UMLs need to be added as well however I do get a solid understanding of what the authors want to do with the code even though I do not know exactly what parts of the code they will modify.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes. Their project is an&nbsp;extending of a previous project and they included both the previous&nbsp;implementation and their new changes to functionality of badging. They also removed the introduction to expertiza as I suggested in the previous review which is good. Now their wiki is descriptive. They got ""Motivation"" and ""Problem Statement"" to illustrate their changes and goals. I think can find everything I need, so it's perfect to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>They want to extend badging functionality and mainly implement 4 new functionalities on badging&nbsp; They have fully explained how they will implement them in ""Implementation"" which is well-written and easy to follow. But they just gave a brief description of their implement plan. Readers like me may&nbsp;wonder some edge cases such as will awarded badges be removed if the related assignment is deleted and for ""good teammate"" badge what if 2 or more teammates assign this badge to a student instead of just one teammate,&nbsp;in this case will the student gets more than 1 badge if approved?</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes.&nbsp;From their wiki it seems they have totally thought through&nbsp;all the 4 implementations and had a clear plan.</p>,,,-1,"<p>They got wonderful diagrams to illustrate user case their expected views for each of their implementations. For the latter, the diagrams clearly describe what changes will be made to views after implementation and for the former, it shows the relationship between the database and users when performing kinds of functionalities&nbsp;about badging. A minor problem is that the pictures are too large and can't perfectly fit the page and the&nbsp;resolution is kind of low.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes. in ""Test Plan"" they made a good testing list, but it looks a little bit simple. I'd recommend to add related files or methods that would be tested to each description such as ""Can save&nbsp; badge with a valid name, description and image.""&nbsp;and I think this will give your ""Test Plan"" more detailed information and let readers follow easier. Also it's better to include test results when you finish all the tests.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes. They have explained well the changes to be made to the view, model, database, and controllers. They also included how the view would look like after the implementation. It is well documented. Good job.</p>

<p>I had only a small confusion in the Implementation Doubts section.

I'm not sure if they considered how they would test different cases, but I would certainly start to consider the possibilities as if the contribution isn't tested well enough, it may break other areas of the project and they won't integrate your contributions. Simply put, you can start by testing the basic functionality works assuming everything is correct. Then you could move to other cases, like what happens if it tries to pull a submitted review that has been deleted by either the user or an instructor? I would certainly urge them to think about testing and their testing plan, because in my opinion testing is just about more important than the new contribution, because if it breaks old code, then the project didn't accomplish anything to be worked around.</p>",,,1,<p>No Test plan is included in the documentation.

<p>Maybe they could include the file they edited and the code they wrote to make things clearer.</p>
<p>And I am also confused by the second task they needs to do: 2. Add column grant_permission[----] to table [--------------------------] for storing user permission (published or not) for each project.</p>
<p>Isn't this already included in our current production version? There is a column for ""Publishing Rights"". Am I missing something here?</p>",,,-1,<p>The code is well written by following all good design principles.</p>,,,1,"<p>A lot of the code does look well done. I'm not exactly sure how to review the javascript that was written, but for the ruby code it does follow convention. I do notice in app/views/sample_submissions/_general.html.erb that there seems to be a lot of logic contained within the view that could be moved into the controller. In general you want to use the view for very limited logic and just to control how something looks, where the controller decided what is shown. The same is true of the app/views/sample_submissions/_responses.html.erb. I would say the index.html.erb file was done better, but in general try to design the system such that minimal use of logic in the view is achieved. The test code looks pretty good where you set up the situations and assert certain outcomes, or use capybara to run through the view tests.</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall, I think the code is well written. Only minor thing is view code contains some logic. I don't really know how we could avoid this.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is well written. There are not any redundancies that i can see.

The most recent updates seen in githubs compare function show a lot of work went into properly formatting the code for Expertiza. Great work in this area!</p>",,,1,<p>Code that has been added follows ruby style coding. The name of the functions are also intuitive.

<p>Suggestion: They could have added screenshots of the results of running the tests which shows whether they pass.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>They added tests cases to test their code. While it seems that it covers things well they never talk about if the test cases pass or what the coverage is. However, I think that could be out of the scope of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes the system works correctly.

There was only single test which is regarding successfully running a game.

I think it would be a good idea to test out with different sizes or moving from different positions. At least to add more depth to the test plan because it seems like you only have one test. However, this is improved from the last time so I will award a higher score.</p>",,,1,<p>The tests included are only to check the performance of the drawImage method. More tests could have been included to test functionality.</p>,,,-1,"<p>There is a small section about testing which I believe doesnt cover all the functionalities.

We used way more models and controllers to make app to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>But I am a little confused by a function defined in user.rb, create_new_user. At first, I thought, this is such a good idea, we went through a lot to make Admin to be able to create a new user. Then, I try to see how it is used and where it is used. But I could not find any.</p>
<p>Another thing, maybe some of the controller code could be included in the model, such as index function in the jobs controller.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code was written with good Ruby and Rails coding practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- Proper naming conventions used</p>
<p>- Proper validations done &amp; relationships defined</p>",,,1,"<p>The code followed good&nbsp;ruby on rails coding practices. The code was well-designed. There are a bit of some functionality issues with the admin and job seeker.</p>
<p>Good improvements</p>
<p>1) The team has linked the apply button directly in the job description which is very useful.</p>
<p>2) When the apply button has clicked some fields like job id and company id are auto-filled&nbsp;which reduces the effort of the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points to improve</p>
<p>1) The admin login details mentioned in the README file seems to log in as a job seeker and not as Admin.</p>
<p>2) The admin functionality is similar to job&nbsp;seeker which is suspicious.</p>
<p>3) The recruiter&nbsp;was not able to view the applicants for a job.</p>

The options were listed individually in the edit form and also had to be listed again in the model validator.&nbsp; Any updates would have to be done and match identically in both. Enums would let them update in one place for coding consistency and maintainability.</p>,,,-1,<p>The code followed the mvc architecture. All parts of the code look clean . views were dry as required</p>,,,1,"<p>The code is well written with standard naming conventions and use of scaffold generations. All models have thorough validations, and the methods names are self-explanatory without the need for comments. The job-filtering mechanism works very well.<br /><br />However, I noticed that you have hard-coded a lot of option values. For example, you could have used enums to represent Gender, Disability status, Veteran status and Race instead of hard-coding strings. Similarly, you could have used enums to represent the job application status. The benefit of doing things this way would become clear if you decide to make changes to the list of options in the future. For example, if you decide to add another kind of race in the future, you might have to make changes in all the views where these values have been hard-coded. However, if you use an enum, you would only need to change it in the model.<br /><br />I loved your extensive use of page level authentication to check if the right kind of user was trying to do an action. Great work there!</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team made regular commits to their repo</p>",,,1,<p>Yes! 204 Commits. That is admirable. Only downside is they only works on one branch.

<p>Another thing is not related to user interface, but I will put it here: ""New User"" link for admin is not working. You might need to fix this.</p>",,,1,"<p>The User Interface design could have been better.</p>
<p>I could find a few glitches:</p>
<p>1. When I opened the URL of the application, I found that someone was already logged in and I had to logout before I could login in as an admin.</p>
<p>2. After logging in as an admin, the message in the top of the page showed ""ABC"" logged in successfully.</p>

Overall the app is well designed.</p>",,,1,"<p>The user interface is very appealing to the eye. The team has put in a considerable amount of effort in the CSS. I particularly liked the use of pagination while listing all jobs/ companies etc.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;there were a few places where it became unintuitive and even the README didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When a user edits his profile, he must enter his password to confirm the changes. While you have used a label above the text field for the password to indicate this, it isn't very noticeable. Every time I tried to save my changes after entering changes, I was re-directed to a ""Something went wrong"" page. It took me a while to realize that I needed to enter my current password in order for the changes to take effect. You can probably add a JS validation saying that the current password is a mandatory field, before redirecting.</li>
<li>Clicking ""New User"" on the admin home page redirects to an error page.</li>
<li>While applying for a job, the current company field is not populated automatically. The user shouldn't be expected to fill this in.&nbsp;</li>

The test plan is well written.</p>,,,1,"<p>Project Purpose: The project purpose has been explained but I am still unclear what exactly is the aim for the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Design: The design has not been explained properly why particularly they chose this design.</p>
<p>Testing : Nothing has been mentioned about their testing plans due which design doc seems to be incomplete as how the functionalities would be tested isn't mentioned.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>Design does incorporate the issues that are to be addressed but the explanations could have provided for the user to completely understand the project.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>The author has suggested the change and how they are planning to do it but it has not been explained properly as I got confused with the second line in Tone Analysis Paragraph. Also the link provided is not working. So it is somewhat hard to follow what and why that particular solution is provided.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>1) They have mentioned the files in which the changes are to be made, but they haven't mentioned the methods that they are planning to add .&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) How is the code modified is not mentioned, so it would be hard to comment whether the code would become ""smelly"" or not</p>
<p>3) It doesn't seem that there exists any gem for simp-lying the aim for their project and the files they target to modify seem correct .</p>
<p>4) The new design doesn't change anything in how the data is to be fetched so it won't affect the response time in any way.</p>
<p>5) More effort could have been given in explaining the images are shared as that could have been easy for the user to understand the solution for the project issue.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>1) The visuals aids have been provided but have not been explained so it is hard to follow what exactly are those images. The quality of the images could have been improved by designing the diagrams online rather than drawing it with pen and paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The images confuse me more about what their aim is for the project.</p>
<p>3) UML Diagrams have not been included.</p>
<p>4) They tried to give the diagrams for the results they aim to see after the completion of the project but do not give an idea of how are they going to achieve it from code.</p>",,,1,"<p>The functionality is covered in the proposed implementation section, but this section is too verbose. This may be rectified by adding mockups as stated before.</p>",,,1,"<p>They wrote the potential changes in Propose Implementation which is quite easy to understand and followed the requirements. But it's just too short, details of implementations are not discussed and it's almost a copy of the requirements, so I'd recommend apart from Propose Implementation&nbsp;they may write Implementation Plan which discusses each proposed change in detail and includes newly-added files, classes, methods, variables and their functionalities.</p>",,,1,"<p>One change I would suggest in the proposed implementation is adding the files which would be affected by the change proposed or in the file modification adding what this change is for.</p>
<p>The proposed changes no where mention when the instructor will add questions related to each role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>overall the proposed implementation gives a good idea what&nbsp;one might need to do to accommodate this change .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>These changes are difficult to visualize.&nbsp; Adding one or two mockups with arrows with the bullet points pointing to the relevant section of the mockup would be helpful.&nbsp; For example, the bullet item ""When a student goes to &ldquo;Your team&rdquo;, he should be able to select a duty from a drop down menu."" may be better shown with a screenshot of the ""Your team"" page with the added drop-down and an explanation of its function.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has already identified the files that need to be changed and are planning to add a couple of new files. The team seems to have figured out a lot of stuff already, which is excellent. The explanation is easy to follow and is adequate.</p>",,,-1,<p>The explanation is quite easy to follow and the proposed changes seem to be correct to be implement the intended functionality.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>Adequate explanation was provided on the features that are to be added. Everything from the problem statement to the UML diagrams to the file changes to the Test plan was explained. Also, the changes were explained in a simple manner and I had no trouble following what they had written. Hence giving a 5.</p>",,,1,<p>It's hard for me to guess what method will be added into which class since they explain the whole things together without subdivided them into subsections.</p>,,,-1,"<p>As indicated in the proposed implementation, all the changes and additions that the team intends to do sound quite reasonable. They have also mentioned the files that will be modified/added. So, overall they have done a good job with the proposed design.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<ol>
<li>They're mostly making their own classes, so that isn't relevant.</li>
<li>I think this code might be adding a lot of confusing relationships and putting in methods places they might not belong.</li>
<li>They don't really look complicated, they just look empty.</li>
<li>Probably not.</li>
<li>Yeah, the design looks like it's in the pre-preplanning phases. For example: Why do Questions have a Questionnaire? Why don't Questionnaires have any Questions? Why does the proposed implementation talk so much about keys to tables, I thought this was supposed to be done with objects? It's just all very confusing and I'm not sure it's nailed down yet.</li>
</ol>",,,-1,<p>I don't think the proposed designs would cause the problems mentioned above.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design document could have explained some sections a bit more like what test cases they plan to write for the test cases</p>,,,-1,"<p>Looking mainly at the UML diagram for this question, the design puts the methods in the appropriate classes, and creates a table with the necessary fields. The only potential chance I see for code smells would be a DRY problem, with duty methods potentially being implemented for students and instructors. But the current design avoids that issue.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Their goal is to add a new function to expertiza like a role-based reviewing so that students can select their role(duty) of an assignment and will be reviewed through a role-based evaluation rubric. According to their wiki, all their proposed changes are reasonable and necessary to achieve their goal, so it's hard to tell if their design and code are problematic. But I noticed a minor problem: In ""Files that have to be modified"", you may miss ""view/"" for the last three directories because I just can't find such directories.</p>",,,1,"<p>There is no mention of methods which will be affected only class has been mentioned.</p>
<p>From what I can say there would be a need to add controller, model and view of duties, in the duties table should there be a reference to rubric associated with the duty, also the primary key would be based on the name of duty and instructor id, it would have been better if they mentioned this in the files to be added&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The ""Files that have to be modified"" section could be made better by going into more detail with regards to what the proposed modifications are.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design proposed by the authors seems good. They have thought of every aspect as of now. I don't think there are any potential flaws that need addressing to.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design is well explained. They have not stated any coding strategies they are going to follow hence cannot comment if the solution might make the code smelly.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>1) I didn't find any improper method additions in the design</p>
<p>2) The document explains how different constraints are to be handled and I don't see any potential code smells.</p>
<p>3) The design is simple enough and as most of the changes are in views, I don't think additional gems will be required.</p>
<p>4) Since the Duties functionality will be added to existing views, I think there won't be a major change in the response times.</p>
<p>5) The design looks good and the team should start implementing it</p>
<p>For the above reasons, I am giving a 5.</p>",,,1,<p>The team has done a good job with the UML diagram that have provided. Only suggestion that I could give is to provide a small explanation for the UML diagram so that it is bit easier to understand.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The UML class diagram is necessary and could be useful if changed, but it doesn't look like it is correctly constructed, unless I'm really confused.</p>
<p>It appears that Question has a single Questionnaire, but Questionnaires don't have <em>any</em> Questions, which doesn't sound like that makes sense.</p>
<p>It also appears that User just has a random line attached to Duty, which isn't a thing in UML class diagrams.</p>
<p>I can definitely see this diagram being incredibly handy for understanding the design if fixed and improved, but, as it stands, it's just confusing.</p>
<p>It does seem like the design isn't figured out yet, though, and the diagram just reflects what the current understanding is.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. The UML diagrams help me understand the project better.</p>,,,1,"<p>The UML diagram looked very informative. But apart from that I could not find other screenshots .</p>
<p>They could have provided some more diagrams that could have explained the design doc better.</p>",,,-1,"<p>the UML diagram really helped me understand the flow of this project. Without the diagram I think the write up may have been hard to follow, so I am glad the team included it.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>They have made an awesome UML diagram to illustrate the relationship between the newly-added Duty model with other relevant models. It's intuitive and very helpful for readers to understand what they are going to implement the ""Duty"" functionality. But as a reader, I got confused over the following things in the diagram and you may consider fixing these:</p>
<p>1.Is the variable dutyId necessary in Duty? because I think rails can&nbsp;auto generate ID for any created model itself.</p>
<p>2.It's not clear what ""&lt;&lt;users&gt;&gt;"" on those doted lines mean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The UML diagram gives a good idea of what approach they intend to take and where all the changes will be.</p>
<p>The diagram is just enough to give a accurate depiction of changes required.</p>",,,1,<p>The UML diagram is a really nice touch that allows a lot of information to be shown quickly and concisely. It is suggested that similar mockups be added to the test plan and proposed implementation to serve the same purpose.</p>,,,1,<p>The UML diagram is appropriate and helps a lot in making understanding things easier. The team could have added a screen mock up but that can be overlooked considering the amount of detailing in the document.</p>,,,1,<p>The design doc contains a UML diagram to explain the functionality. But I suggest they add a small explanation of the diagram in order to make it more easy to follow.</p>,,,1,"<p>There was a single UML diagram which was a class diagram that was very detailed and also showed the relationships between the classes. But I felt that at this stage, a usecase diagram and an activity diagram would have been better choices to help explain the problem clearly. There was also no mockups, hence I am deducting 2 points.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes the authors have done a good job with the explanation provided for the proposed changes. The proposed implementation section of the document includes the changes that the team intends to incorporate and it also includes details about how the team is going to achieve those changes. So, overall a good job.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Compared to the first version, this has massively stepped up. My initial complaints have been dealt with, so I'm not really sure what to add here.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The changes need to be made to each file are well explained. Great work.</p>
<p>The database changes, instructor view changes, and student view changes are so well explained. Good job.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the explanations are good, but could have been a more structured</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes. From their wiki&nbsp;especially in ""Proposed Implementation"" it seems they have fully explained the changes they will make to expertiza which includes Migration changes, Instructor view changes and Student view changes, and each of these was quite descriptive and easy to understand. They also listed the files to be modified and files to be created which is very thoughtful. But I want to mention a little problem: in both ""Migration changes"" and ""Instructor view changes"", they gave very detailed descriptions of how to make the changes such as which parameter and method need to be created or modified to realize some functionalities. However in ""Student view changes"" it seems they just described the changes made to the view and nothing is mentioned how to do that.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have gone into just the right amount of detail in explaining the changes that will be made.&nbsp; The use of ""role"" instead of ""duty"" throughout the document can be confusing.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the authors have adequately explained the changes that are to be made in the system. The doc is very descriptive of every little detail of the project.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have very clearly mentioned what the changes to be made are.

<p>Also this team has mentioned the changes that they need to make in detail but have not mentioned the files that needs to be changed. This would make it easier for the reader to gauge these changes and see if they are accurate or not.</p>

<p>Secondly, the proposed implementation should also contain details of the application files (views/models etc) that needs changing.</p>
<p>Third, the authors need to add a ""Test Plan"" section and describe the same.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document provides in depth details about the current issues and things to be implemented which is good.

Consider thinking forward and adding test plans, as well as setting up a git fork that you'll be working on and adding it as necessary external links.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design doc incorporates all the functionalities that are required to be implemented for this project. It explains the role of each functionality and explains the plan of action for implementation.</p>
<p>Just one suggestion , the project requirement states that in the review report , the course name and the student name must be shown as correctly it does not display that. This part has not been clearly stated in the doc but rather implied. It would be better if this is also stated as a goal and implementation steps are shown for it in the next submission.</p>",,,1,<p>Yes. The authors have captured all the functionality mentioned in the project requirements. They have also done a good job explaining the same in their documentation. They could improve this by separating their documentation into mode logical sections than it is now.</p>,,,1,<p>The wiki introduces the functionality very well.

So I feel there can be certain additions to the explanations that describe how the proposed changes will be implemented.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Mention the files that will need changes and what kind of changes so that the person reading the document can understand what changes on code level have been proposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>All the explanations are easy to understand and follow. The changes mentioned could be understood by anyone who doesn't have any prior knowledge on the system. Good work team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important part is that they have explained everything in detail with all the necessary supporting examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes made in the Review Summary Page like changes in Header, where the team is trying to figure out fixing whitespace is not clear to me. This could have been explained well.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author has proposed some pretty concrete changes in the this doc. All these changes address the requirements as stated in the project problem statement. The idea of color coding in the review report is great and would make the job of the instructor easier. The idea of propagating the change in background color after sorting is great. This is not explicitly mentioned in the problem but rather have been spun up by the team to add convenience. This is really good.</p>
<p>However , I would suggest that , instead of just stating your plan of action , the team should have given a brief explanation of the implementation of these proposed ideas for the reviewer to judge. Including the files required to be edited would also be great and increase the understanding of the implementation that the team has in mind.</p>
<p>Adding a brief explanation of the implementation and including a list of files in which the proposed changes have been made would be really helpful for the reviewers.</p>",,,1,<p>The document covers the changes that the team will be making and seems to know how they'll be tackling them. It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly.

Including these give a feel that the team has been thorough and have a solid foundation to work on.</p>,,,1,<p>Explanation of each change is very good and detail - I really like the screenshots.&nbsp; I do think you need a better introduction explaining things.&nbsp; Just go into a little more detail about what expertiza is and what you're trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The wiki doesn't introduce how to achieve all the functionality in detail. But some of them are good.</p>,,,-1,"<p>As I mentioned earlier, for all the proposed changes the authors have not mentioned what files will need modification and what files may be added so I cannot make a comment about the problems mentioned in the question.</p>",,,1,"<p>I did not find a section where the classes, models, controllers or views that would be impacted were listed.</p>
<p>They could have listed it in a separate section so that they could have been visible properly</p>",,,1,"<p>For the scope of their project the implementation the team has planned looks good to me. Most of the changes are in the UI part (View file, CSS changes) so they need to make sure they coordinate all the sections to different views and control the specific actions. It looks like the changes for the system doesn't require any additional gem so the implementation decision is correct. The team should have minimum code in the view so that it doesn't increase the response time of the system.</p>
<p>Any of the implementation could make the code smelly so the team has to be careful in not putting too much logic into the view which is the standard followed. Optional additional improvements have also been given which is good.&nbsp;</p>

Not only did the team use visual aids illustrate the problems in the exisiting system, but they also used them to illustrate their prorposed changes in detail. As opposed to a paper or whiteboard mockup, the team put in the time to alter screenshots and create digital visuals to accurately depict their changes. The only issue is as mentioned before; one of the proposed changes (<strong><span id=""Issue_2:_Updating_Review_Summary_view_2"" class=""mw-headline"">Updating Review Summary view</span></strong>) does not have a visual aid, even though the change affects the view.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The diagrams which have been provided give a deep insight of what and where the changes could be seen, the diagrams are a tad bit big, UML cannot be expected from this project as its completed related to view and controller.</p>

The test plan is well written.</p>,,,1,"<p>The team has mentioned test plan but the tests are pretty basic, and only scratch the surface. For eg, if a more complex approach is taken, eg- the SPARK approach, it requires all scores to be normalized, the maximum score being 1. How will they test for correct normalization?

They have mentioned different approaches but they haven't included all the test cases that will be required to check the functionality of these approaches</p>,,,1,"<p>The authors have added a basic test plan. They have added specific test cases as well. But the tests are not very specific.

<p>Other then that, good job!</p>",,,-1,"<p>In the jobs_controller.rb file I see if statements that were checking a negative condition in the search method; for this type of set up, 'unless' could be used as a ruby term to represent that negative condition better. Also this if structure seems reminiscent of Java or C, and could potentially be done in a better way. I do see good use of the sessions_helper.rb file in the project, which I have come to appreciate through the completion of my own team's project. Helper classes can be very useful to return functionality with great coding practices. The models have the good ancestry and relationships set up between models, to allow the sort of functionality needed in the system. The homepage index view file seems to have a lot of embedded ruby code, which I believe is not indicative of good coding practice. I think some of the functionality, such as figuring out which type of user is signed in, could be levied to the controller, where you then use what the controller returns to decide how the view responds. Other than these specific instances, I think the rest of the project is set up in a great way.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows MVC architecture and shows good Ruby and Rails coding practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p>There looked to be Java/C++ conventions (for example, != """" instead of .blank? or .nil? and if blocks instead of if/unless at end of statement.&nbsp; While not necessarily a coding practice, there was no validation of user access in the controllers, only the views.&nbsp; Also more of a general Git convention, they uploaded things like tmp files that shouldn't be committed.</p>",,,1,<p>The ruby and rails practices are followed</p>,,,-1,"<p>The code is well structured throughout. Proper naming conventions has been used for variables, classes and methods. Most code is self-explanatory and commenting for code not auto-generated by Rails isn't necessary.

I think any implementation could make the code ""smelly"", but they should be careful to not put too much code into the views. It does seem that it may be better for them to consider even extra implementation since modifying a few views seems like a fairly narrow scope, but overall their ideas seem logical and coherent.</p>",,,-1,<p>I think the designs would not cause any of the problems mentioned above.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The above listed problems do not exist with the design.

For example, the functionality that students are entitled to assign badges may slightly increase the time of loading pages.</p>",,,1,"<p>For the most part, the design looks good. The only thing that is missing is the UML diagrams or some model of the code that will be modified. I cannot check if the authors plan to add methods to the wrong class because I do not know anything about the code. However, aside from that issue, everything looks great! You tell us what files you are modifying on the front-end, but not on the back end with the database, which I imagine would be the more challenging portion.

The team has mostly figured out as to where the changes need to be made. However, knowing what controller changes would be made would be helpful to know as to whether it would be efficient. Also, make sure the icons used are open source and do not have any copyright infringement associated.</p>",,,-1,"<p>i didn't see anything that going to be a problem in their right now plan. But one thing they might need to pay attention is when they modified the origin files, they should avoid collision with other related files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The UML diagram shows pretty well the exchange of data.

But I guess there's a little problem with this diagram: ""View badges received"" should read data from the database instead of writing data to the database, so I think the arrow is backwards. Also, I'd mention a little advice even though it wasn't mentioned in the requirements:&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be better if they could illustrate (maybe not in this diagram) what other roles can do with badging (such as admin) rather than just instructor and student.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Use of mock-ups is excellent, and are necessary.

<p>The layout of the app is clean and simple and easy to follow. There was no confusion in navigating the app. However, it took quite some time to enter the address in proper format. Same goes for the website and revenue while creating a company. You may put a sample address and phone number in the README if you are strictly restricting the format. When applying for a job as a job-seeker, the error prompt for the portfolio format says that it should be of the form http(s)://www.website.com/org/etc however it only accepts the format http(s)://www.website.com. The same issue arised while creating a company while signed in as a recruiter.</p>

The team has written the tests quite well describing most of the cases, though missed a few. In this case, I don't think there was a need to use any design pattern as most of the changes are in the views and the controller methods are quite small too. However , I feel the implementation of the first issue '<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px;"">Change create topic UI to AJAX</span>' was not described in detail.

The controller method names are apt as they each describe a particular action being performed following ruby conventions. The instance variables defined are also very intuitive as suggestive of their functionality. In the controller methods, there are two variables suggestions and suggestionscomment. Most likely suggestion comment refers to the suggestion associated with a comment. However , I think maybe this variable should be renamed as comments_for_suggestion just to avoid any ambiguity. Also including &nbsp; underscores in variable names is more ruby like.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is well written by this team. The ruby conventions have been followed.

So there are tests for the controllers, just not enough of them.</p>",,,-1,<p>They thoroughly tested CRUD actions of 4 controllers by using rails test and tested one model&nbsp;with Rspec.</p>,,,1,"<p>Both the User controller and model were thoroughly tested using good rspec techniques.&nbsp; The tests were well named and easy to understand.&nbsp; Additionally, the team did a good job testing all of the crud operations associated with each controller.&nbsp; One suggestion I do have though, is that the tests could be documented a bit better.&nbsp; Javadoc would be very appropriate in this case as it would help the reader to understand what the test was doing exactly.&nbsp; If I had one suggestion to the team for testing, it would be adding javadoc to each test method.&nbsp; Other then that, great job!</p>",,,-1,<p>yes one model and controller is tested.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. There are ample number of commits to justify that the team has constantly pushed their changes to GitHub</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team was regular with their commits.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The commits are frequent and detailed, they solve small issues and generally don't require merge functionality. The number of commits is a bit uneven though, This could be caused by pair programming though.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>109 commits since 15 days ago but with only 1 branch. They may write code in same branch but I think write code in respective branch then merge into a main branch is better because if something go wrong it's easy to figure out whose part's code need to be improved.</p>
<p>Anyway, they kept pushing changes throughout the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the team made a total of 109 commits!&nbsp; This is an impressive number.&nbsp; Additionally, the team did a good job working together, as it appears each team mate made multiple commits towards master.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black; background: white;"">Committing and pushing to github regularly is helpful for many reasons.&nbsp; One, it makes building a large, shared application much easier as everything can be built in little bite sized pieces. You all did a great job utilizing the issues and branching techniques in github.&nbsp; Using separate branches, allows each issue to be associated with a specific code branch off of master.&nbsp; This is useful, as when a pull request is made into master, the other team members are able to see exactly what that pull request contains.&nbsp; Creating Github issues is helpful in that it makes chopping up a large project into smaller, easier to understand tasks very simple.&nbsp; Each issue can be assigned to different team members, and it helps everyone contribute an equal amount and work well together as a team.&nbsp; I was really impressed by how well your team appeared to use this resource. Great job.</span></p>",,,1,<p>There are git commits for every new feature implemented. The git documentation is very good and they have brought to notice the AWS bug pretty nicely.</p>,,,-1,<p>A new user with no background knowledge could easily use the app.</p>,,,1,"<p>1. README file can put some bullets before different topics so that it's easy to read.</p>
<p>2. <strong>The webpage was down when I just want to begin to try all the functionality and the error message was ""The page you were looking for doesn't exist"". It seems that Heroku has some problems&nbsp;because last team's webpage I reviewed also became down at some time.</strong></p>",,,-1,"<p>User interface:</p>

The team has done a good job in describing all the functions and the tests</p>,,,-1,<p>The code / work seems to be done complete and could be deployed onto the production server.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The build did not pass the Travis CI.

There could be additional&nbsp;scenarios that could be tested to increase the test cover range of the project. The team made a good effort in testing with various test cases.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The write-up was well written and described the intent of the project. The write-up was detailed enough to easily understand and test the project. The team made a good effort in write-up. The write-up clearly explained the type of tests written and their purpose. The authors explained all tests like four node cycle, three node cycle etc.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has made good efforts to test nearly 90% test cases and some additional test cases can make this code ready to be deployed onto the production server. The code was well written and tested hence some additional testing could make the project deployable.</p>,,,1,"<p>The build has passed in Travis CI. There are no major issues as such. The only issues are codeclimate issues, which the team tried taking care of so as to make the code as DRY as possible. The code needs some minor refactoring in some places.</p>",,,-1,<p>The coverage has increased after adding their code. The test cases are well thought of and exhaustively cover the range of this project.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The code works fine and the tests are as intended. They have done a great job of following good coding practices. The tests do cover all the scenarios.</p>,,,-1,"<p>They have done a great job with the writeup this time around. The writeup is very descriptive, and it's very easy to follow what all changes the team has made, how they have done it and where the changes are from the writeup. They have also added a screen cast of what all changes they have made which makes things easier.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think the team has followed the right approach and has painstakingly made sure that they follow good coding practices. I do think the code, with a little refactoring, is ready to be deployed onto the production server.</p>",,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Travis CI build has passed, however, they are having code climate issues yet and the coverage is 45%</p>",,,1,"<p>They added new test cases for the project, coverage increases by 0.8%, altough there are few comments in the code, so it is difficult to understand the code flow</p>",,,1,"<p>As mentioned from the wiki, they have covered all the test cases</p>
<p>Since comments are not present, it is difficult to understand the flow of code</p>",,,-1,<p>The write-up is clear and self-explanatory</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, as per my understanding the code is well-written and has covered edge cases, but since the pull request has not been accepted yet, I believe there are minor changes to be done</p>",,,1,"<p>The build passed in Travis CI. The codeclimate issues still exist and they could be taken care of, moreover I feel the code could have been dried up more by removing repeated let statements.</p>",,,1,<p>The coverage has increased a lot and reached 100% coverage. The team did a good job in covering all cases and edge conditions.</p>,,,1,"<p>The code works fine and tests cover all the scenarios, but the code could have coupled the repeated statements in before each and that would have been great.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have done well with the writeup. They have done a good job of explaining the test scenarios and also have uploaded a screen cast which makes it easy for a reviewer to review their work.</p>,,,1,"<p>I feel that by making changes to the code and removing unnecessary and repeated statements in the test cases the code can be improved more and thus can be dried up a lot, which will then be ready for deployment.</p>",,,1,"<p>There are 40 issue conflict, most of which is related to Block has too many lines of code. but its not much comparatively so nice work</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes the test coverage has increased by 0.8 percent, which is quite a good job.</p>",,,-1,<p>The testing video does a amazing job in telling what the test cases were and it explained it well what the test cases do and very well explained video was provided.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The write up is good, and provides ample explanation, the video is amazing and explains everything very well.</p>
<p>They have understood the problem defination well and they have given proper justification for what each test is doing.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes the code is production ready, just mint minor concerns will have to be looked into like spacing and similar block etc, the problems which are specified by code climate, rest everything is done great</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The writeup is extremely good. This is one of the better writeups , I have seen. Each of the headings and future work to test description is extremely intuitive and helpful for any reviewer to review.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>yes, the code can be deployed to production as-is. The project can be taken forward by any team and they can implement their future functionality seamlessly.</p>",,,-1,<p>Passed the Travis Cl.&nbsp; Also thanks for linking the pull request.&nbsp; I sometimes have had to search for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team completed all test cases and increased the coverage to 100%. Based on the coverage being brought up to 100%, documentation, and youtube video, it seems that you have covered everything you were supposed to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The youtube video clearly explains the test cases and shows that they all pass.&nbsp; Additionally, it shows that the coverage is at 100% (clear proof).&nbsp; I really liked how you explained your test cases in the youtube video.&nbsp; It made it much easier to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>While this project excelled in all areas (best project I have reviewed), the documentation was its weakest part.&nbsp; The documentation wasn't bad (very good) but was a little hard to read/understand everything. Specifically in the introduction of the problem.&nbsp; You go into detail of the task plan but I had a hard time understanding it all because the intro wasn't as strong.&nbsp; The youtube video helped fix this but I think both should stand alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes! It is a unit test that has 100% coverage and has been proven to work.&nbsp; It definitely belongs in production.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>Test plan is not included in the design doc. However this project is related to modify view files.</p>

There are some thing I would recommend, the background info does try to explain but it seems a little hard to visualize what you are trying to say there. Adding more visuals would help reviewers better understand your work.

<p>Instead of this, they can use a before_action in someplace thats more common for the flow of code (like the application_controller.rb).

What I wish was explained more, was what exactly does&nbsp;on_the_fly_calc_spec.rb do? You explain the places where you need to add tests, but I am having difficulty simply understanding the point as to the model and tests. The names themselves arent even defined enough to provide me the insight, so I would recommend explaining the point of the project in that regard. As such, what functions would performing these tests provide to Expertiza? What do they do? Explaining this would also help me and any other users the ability to understand how the project carries out these calculations and performs its purported function.</p>",,,1,"<p>I suppose my answer to the previous area could be used here as well. Basically, I like the way you explain your plan, but i think it would be very helpful for us and yourselves to explain the true function you are trying to bring, besides just saying you are testing this model, but not explaining what it does. I believe you could definitely come up with a great explanation and then this area would be perfect! To be honest, it looks like its a work in progress, as you have the sections made already, and so I'm sure once you explain the sections this area will be fulfilled.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It does in a way include a to-be-added test section, but i'm not 100% if its going to have a more logical format. Before this, they didn't explain their plan beforehand,, which I would recommend a possible next step as well.

If you use the same time of testing returns, you can make a much more DRY and readable testfile this way.

The length of some of the tests could be improved by implementing the DRY technique i mentioned already.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There really wasn't much of a Test Plan described, so I can't say they converted the cases.

<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>I clearly understand. The writeup explains everything.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the authors have explained how they tested the functions in the model.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has included a test plan section and is details about the functions they covered. But there are some of the functions they did not cover: score_assignment and participant_score. They also seem to have missed out on one of the conditions in the calc_review_score.</p>,,,-1,<p>Comments in the code are missing.</p>,,,-1,"<p>All the test cases authors have provided seem to cover all possible scenarios.

The testing is done using the RSpec testing framework.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. There are ample number of commits to justify that the team has constantly pushed their changes to GitHub</p>,,,1,"<p>There is a spec/models folder but I do not see a spec/controllers folder. in the models folder is a single file testing the user model. The test file covers the validations required to create a valid user, and tests the model function created in user.rb. I would just recommend adding the tests for the controllers. That being said in the test folder is the basic scaffold testing created by the rails generate function. So there are tests for the controllers, just not enough of them.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the system. They have clearly and eloquently explained the problem and the solution proposed by them to solve these problems. The use of the UML and wireframes have made the design and the author's intentions very clear and the data Flow is easy to understand.</p>
<p>However, I have one suggestion. I like the fact that the files to be modified have been listed. However, they should mention in brief what changes are to be brought about in the file. The authors have provided the UML which shows the changes that they plan to make. However, adding a brief explanation of each of these changes proposed in the corresponding file would have enabled the reviewers and the readers to get a better understanding of the implementation.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design appears to be sound. The proposed design has been explained with the help of a UML diagram and wireframes. These are quite descriptive and help in understanding the proposed implementation by the author. However , only a brief explanation has been given of these diagrams. It would have been great if the authors would have elaborated&nbsp;more&nbsp;over the diagrams.</p>
<p>Also, I believe most of the doc gives an overview of the proposed idea. Only some information have been given about the actual implemenattaion. It would have been better, if more information would have been provided on this front. But I understand that can be difficult at this early stage.</p>
<p>Also , I believe that it would have been better if the authors would have included some more information about the peer logic, AJAX and JQuery and how exactly will it be integrated with the design. For someone , with no prior information about peer logic, it can be slightly difficult to understand.</p>",,,1,"<p>The commits are frequent and detailed, they solve small issues and generally don't require merge functionality. The number of commits is a bit uneven though, This could be caused by pair programming though.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design proposed by the authors is concise and simple. It addresses all the problems mentioned in the problem statement accurately while keeping the UI simple. I like the use of Peer logic for tone analysis. It keeps the overall design simple while using third party services for the necessary purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not very familiar with the JQuery and AJAX and would have liked more information on these to be supplied in the document to better gauge the complexity of this design.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the visuals included in the doc are very descriptive of the proposed design. The UML diagram is very illustrative and gives a clear indication of the data flow. The wireframes included gives a very good idea of the intended results to be achieved by this team along with the steps to achieve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have one suggestion though, it would have been good to include a flowchart or a use case diagram to illustrate the steps of implementation. While they have represented their idea pictorially , the actual implementation lacks some representation. Including a use case diagram or a flowchart of the implementation would have aided in understanding the program flow.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, a test plan is included in this document. The test plan is very descriptive and elaborative. It clearly states the different scenarios to be tested and a detailed description of the various tests performed for each scenario has been provided. The test cases are well thought of and are quite exhaustive covering the entire range of functionalities.</p>
<p>However, the test cases included are mostly only for the views. I would suggest to include tests for the controller methods where a response is received from peer logic and the response is checked for correctness. Various scenarios of the json response received for different requests can be checked.</p>
<p>I would suggest to add some controller tests which tested the different controller methods written for tone anlaysis.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes the team has done a good job in explaining the changes that are supposed to be made to the system. They have drawn UML diagrams and have explained the test plan well.</p>,,,1,<p>Yes the design appears to be sound. They have briefed upon all important aspects of the project and explained what is important with good amount of details.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, The design seems to be simple. They have given a flow chart view of how control is gonna flow when going through the use cases and have done a good job of explaining what needs to be done.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team has done a good job in explaining changes that are supposed to be done using diagrams. They have a flowchart using wire frames&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">showing the flow of the user control to each of the updated views. They have also drawn a UML diagram showing how they are going to use the API calls.</span>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes the design includes a very vivid test plan with each test enumerated with different scenarios. It seems to me that the team has considered all the cases that the system can go through and have devised a good looking test plan for their project.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Since the last review, the authors have stepped up their game. The wiki is very good with images and explanations. i really like the wiki and the efforts they have put in after round 1 reviews.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The design appears very concise and sound. There is no mention of any principles and patterns that they have used but rest of the information is very good.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>They thoroughly tested CRUD actions of 4 controllers by using rails test and tested one model&nbsp;with Rspec.</p>,,,1,"<p>109 commits since 15 days ago but with only 1 branch. They may write code in same branch but I think write code in respective branch then merge into a main branch is better because if something go wrong it's easy to figure out whose part's code need to be improved.</p>
<p>Anyway, they kept pushing changes throughout the project.</p>",,,-1,<p>I believe it is a little complex as the authors have to integrate it with the previous work that is done.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team tested one model and controller</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team was regular with their commits.</p>",,,1,"<p>Both the User controller and model were thoroughly tested using good rspec techniques.&nbsp; The tests were well named and easy to understand.&nbsp; Additionally, the team did a good job testing all of the crud operations associated with each controller.&nbsp; One suggestion I do have though, is that the tests could be documented a bit better.&nbsp; Javadoc would be very appropriate in this case as it would help the reader to understand what the test was doing exactly.&nbsp; If I had one suggestion to the team for testing, it would be adding javadoc to each test method.&nbsp; Other then that, great job!</p>",,,-1,<p>Mockups are very good and they have been explained in great detail for all types of users</p>,,,-1,"<p>1.

<p>2.When I enter ""Edit Profile"" page as admin through Home page and then hit ""Back"", it jumps to users index page instead of jumping back to Home page.</p>

The team has written the tests quite well describing most of the cases, though missed a few.

The controller method names are apt as they each describe a particular action being performed following ruby conventions. The instance variables defined are also very intuitive as suggestive of their functionality. In the controller methods, there are two variables suggestions and suggestionscomment. Most likely suggestion comment refers to the suggestion associated with a comment. However , I think maybe this variable should be renamed as comments_for_suggestion just to avoid any ambiguity.

<p>Preliminary design shows a mock up screen with basic design. Test plan is missing in the document and there is no implementation plan or use case diagram. Try to add the above mentioned items to have the document complete. Project repo link and the link to pull request are given.</p>",,,1,"<p>One of the changes proposed by the team is to change the color&nbsp;scale from blue to green, to red to green that allows the&nbsp;instructor to identify the necessary data. The team has included that in the design document with a mock up to allow the reader to understand it to the best. The integration of review performance is explained clearly in the document with the parameters such as number of reviews, length of reviews etc. One last requirement is to highlight the class performance with a visualization table based on the rubric criteria set by the instructor.</p>
<p>As the design document says the table has to be presorted and allow the user to sort it alphabetically too, but the design document hasn't mentioned that.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author has clearly explained about the problem statement and the high level solution such as using HighChart javascript to integrate the review data and the author data, and the team is still figuring out to find out a way to sort the data.&nbsp;Crisp explanations are given for each of the problem statement. I didn't find anything hard in following it.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be try to check out Ext-JS(Javascript) library to sort the table. It provides and extensive way of sorting by clicking the column names.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author hasn't made any changes to the code, so i couldn't comment whether he/she is adding to a wrong class or not and same is the case whether the new design could make the code smelly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the author has mentioned about using highchart javascript, it is one of the best libraries available around to do data visualization. Highchart javascript library maintains the response time of the system and it is really efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For sorting purpose, the author hasn't figured out any solution, so he/she can check out this gem ""sortable-table"" to do the sorting. This would my sugesstion.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author has provided one basic mockup screen to understand about the visualization. Though the screen looks fine in terms of appearance, it lacks the information that is expected by the user. There should be more details explained in the writeup interm of the mockups.</p>
<p>The author could have given a UML diagram that helps to understand the functionality more. Try to refer the good writeup posted by our professor to figure out how UML diagram has to be.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team seems to have a decent idea of the purpose of the project, what they are supposed to do, how they plan to do it, visualization of how it would roughly look like. Currently they have the testing plan section empty. As this is more of an add-on project, I believe they would be doing same tests as previously and additional tests for the new functionalities. I feel that they have a pretty good understand of the details in the picture they have created. I would try to point out each part of the picture and put text alongside it to help others understand. However, they have written it down below, this could be another alternate better visualization for helping reviewers understand.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has covered almost all the functionalities as per the document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hEnWHshzGCvN5zBMA90L9-eQuuNKX7skYkkwwOQSjyU/edit). I do not have any suggestions here.</p>,,,1,"<p>They have done a really great job trying to explain it to users. They have tried to help reviewers understand their work by adding the picture. They have also added description below it which implies they have the exact understanding of what needs to happen. However, I would better like it if they could add more details to the diagram instead of ""Data"" buttons, adding more texts like ""Round x""..etc. That would add some more clarity.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design appears to be sound. I don't think we should be expecting to see what new methods would make the code more smelly. As this is the initial stage of the design document, this would be something to evaluate in the later stages post implementation. However, they have done a great job at describing the purpose of their project and how they plan to accomplish it. They have even looked into what resources they plan to use for changing the color scheme. I would just recommend making the figure more detail oriented than it is as of now.</p>",,,1,"<p>As I said earlier, they have tried to explain all the aspects of the projects. They did add what is expertiza section which was told by the professor not to do in last week's lecture, but well that doesn't matter much. They have added diagrams which I believe with a bit more details would be fantastic. Apart from that, great work!</p>",,,1,"<p>Test plan section is empty, and there is no explanation of how the mockup fulfills the requirements, or how the intended functionality will be implemented.</p>",,,1,"<p>There is very little information describing the intended design except for a single image. Therefore, although it appears they have considered many aspects of the project, the design document does not communicate how the proposed design incorporates required funcaionality,</p>",,,-1,"<p>There is almost no explanation for the intended changes, aside from a mockup image.</p>",,,-1,"<p>From the one mockup image, it appears the design will be clean, easy to understand, and fulfill at least some of the intended functionality. However, very little detail is given.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The diagram is helpful and clean, however it is not explained, and it is difficult to determine where it fits in with their design.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team explained what their plan is, the purpose of the project, added a mockup for visualization. The test plan is not implemented yet.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>According to the description for their topic, they have included&nbsp;all details. However, as the main document for the final project states: ""Your design document does not have to (and should not!) explain what Ruby on Rails is, or what Expertiza is, or what Mozilla/Servo is."" So, maybe you should delete the Expertiza description.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The changes that they are going to implement are clear and detailed, easy to read and follow.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team's plan is clear: to change visualization graphics. However,&nbsp;they&nbsp;haven't indicated what files they will work on in order to implement their design.&nbsp;So, it's not clear yet if their changes would make the code ""smelly"" or they would increase the response time.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>The team followed the description for what they are to implement. They have added a good mock-up. I wish they have added the current issues screenshots. I'm sure once they will add more detailed screenshots once they're done with the project.</p>,,,1,"<p>Testing plan is missing. (Only heading is given).</p>
<p>Project purpose is clearly stated in the problem statement.</p>
<p>Project design is given. A mock-up screenshot is also provided which makes it very easy to understand the expected end result.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the mock-up incorporates all of the required functionality.</p>",,,-1,<p>3 goals are stated for the project in the problem statement. A general description is given in the design. It would have been good if each of these goals and the changes relating to them are described again in the design.</p>,,,1,"<p>1) the authors plan to add method(s) to a wrong class</p>
<p>No details about methods or class provided in the document.</p>
<p>2) the new design may potentially make the code ""smelly""</p>
<p>Not enough information provided in the document to judge if the code can become smelly.</p>
<p>3) the new designs look complicated and there might be existing gems that could simplify them</p>
<p>Not true. The design looks simple and easy to understand.</p>
<p>4) the new design may potentially increase the response time of the system<br />Not true.</p>
<p>5) more effort should be expended on the design</p>
<p>No, the design looks good and not rudimentary.</p>",,,-1,"<p>One mock-up of screen is added. Visual aids for tables or UML diagrams is not present.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;some diagrams are unnecessary and do not help reader understand this project - No. The mockup is necessary and helps me understand the project very well.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; some UML diagrams do not follow the conventions - There are no UML diagrams.</p>
<p>3) some diagrams are too high-level design and do not provide enough details - Details are explained below the mock-up diagram so there is no issue here.</p>",,,1,"<p>There could be more elaboration on how the review data will be shown more clearly. The preliminary design for the visualization is pretty easy to understand and is clean. Also there isn't a design proposed for seeing the class metrics</p>
<p>The authors haven't given a test plan but I am sure they will have one in the final submission</p>",,,-1,"<p>There isn't a proposal for ""class performance""</p>",,,-1,<p>The proposed designs look very intuitive and have the potential to be useful if implemented properly.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>The design changes haven't been proposed in detail that I can comment on the quality of code being added.</p>,,,1,<p>The diagram included is very good. Would help if there were mockups for the other changes being made as well.</p>,,,1,"<p>Considering this is just a crude version, the wiki page is well written. Although not all things have been added, I am able to get an idea of what the team is planning to implement. There is an empty test plan section. As the functionalities that the team is expected to implement, they have a lot of freedom to try and implement different ideas. I would have loved if the authors had been a little more descriptive of the things that they are trying to implement.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>As the project is still in a nascent phase, I don't think the authors will have an exact picture of what the final product will look like. That said, the doc is descriptive enough of the functionalities the team would try to incorporate.</p>",,,1,"<p>The functionalities the team wishes to implement are easy to understand from the doc. The team has made a good effort in trying to explain what the changes would possibly look like. As there no predefined changes the authors are expected to make, it is difficult to explain in entirety what the end result would be. But the team has done a great job with whatever they know as of now.</p>",,,1,<p>It is very difficult to know as of now about the exact changes the team will make. But I think they are on the right track and the design they have proposed seems to do the job as of now.</p>,,,1,"<p>There aren't any UML diagrams. The screen mock up they have provided seems good enough. They have also explained how they plan to make these changes. As of now, the visual aids they have provided seem to do the job.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has provided the project purpose and the design plan. The testing plan hasn't been provided at all.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design does incorporate the given functionality of integration of review performance and class performance.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The authors have explained the changes sufficiently, a demo image has been provided for easier understanding.</p>",,,-1,<p>The exact changes which are required in the files isn't provided at all. The authors should add more information about the code changes.</p>,,,1,<p>The diagram provides a good reflection of the idea behind the project. More diagrams such as flow chart of the logic etc should have been provided.</p>,,,1,"<p>Every&nbsp;section is included except for the testing plan. All other sections are well documented and easy to read. Great work on this. The lack of test plan is fairly understandable at this point so I did not feel that it should lose a significant number of points. On the lower end, however, there is no UML, but a wireframe is present at least. I think if a UML were added and update the test plan this would merit full points for this section.</p>",,,1,"<p>I like the use of the problem statement to list out all the items you need to address. However, while you do address these I think you need to add a section telling how you will fix these issues with your own functionality. I think you do this in part, and I if you keep on this same line of thinking when discussing the implementation you will earn full points.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think the wireframe and explanations that are provided are great and are presented well. However, I think it would be great to have a bulleted&nbsp;list where you address each problem directly with your solution. Use the same numbering as you did in the problem statement section. This will certainly improve the document and make it incredibly clear and easy to follow.</p>",,,1,"<p>The wireframe provided appears simple enough and looks like it solves the issue of the confusing visualizations that are discussed in the problem statement. Since only a wireframe is provided it is difficult to tell whether you would be adding methods to the wrong class. I think, however, that with more effort and with the creation of a UML diagram I could give more useful feedback about your design.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Again I think the wireframe provided is great, but you need to add UMLs to show what code you are planning to modify.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The wiki is well written. some sections are still missing, but i get the idea what the project wants to establish. More information would be better i believe as it makes it more understandable</p>",,,-1,<p>They have mentioned all the functionality they wish to incorporate in the wiki. I would love to see how to project turns out to be.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The changes are easy to understand from the wiki. They have tried their best to explain what they wish to establish with the project with all the information they know about the project.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>Hard to determine as there is no code present to check whether the changes will make it smelly. Overall they have explained it very well.</p>,,,1,"<p>They have only used 1 image to explain what they want to do. Although the given image can be used to get all the information about the project, more images can be added to make it more informative.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have given a good introduction to the project in their description. They have added a ""Problem Statement"" section and a ""Preliminary Design"" section for the same. But the team needs to expand these sections as well as add more relevant sections to their documentation.</p>
<p>They need to add ""Proposed Implementation"" and need to fill in details in the ""Test Plan"" section.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design incorporates the features, but only at a very high level. The team needs to describe the functionality (existing and expected/proposed) in a point-wise manner. Right now, the&nbsp;design description is brief and does not incorporate all the featured requested in the project document.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have not proposed detailed changes that they want to make in the application. They have mentioned that they want to use ""<em style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px;"">highcharts javascript library""&nbsp;</em>and also a few high level descriptions of the features. But they do not mention specific files (.rb, .html etc) they want to modify, or views they want to build.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors propose a cleaner, concise UI. But they need to incorporate more details about the rest of their implementation. Specifically, they need to add point-wise details for all their functionality. They need to mention the various modules of their project and their relationships. At the moment, they only describe the View part of the MVC.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have have a good visualization of what they want to implement. But their work needs to be more details. At the moment it only gives a high-level description of the requirements and does not give minute details. They need to add diagrams for each of the features they intend to implement.</p>
<p>Also, they need to add application flow diagrams if they intend to change the current flow of application or a add new flow.</p>",,,1,"<p><span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Adequate explanation was provided on the features that are to be added.

<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Problem statement is clearly defined by the team at the starting of the document. The author has clearly explained the changes that are going to made to the system by showing the list of files to be modified. The changes are almost in the view part of the MVC though there is only one change in the controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the team has mentioned about the files that are going to be modified, it would have been more understandable if they had included more information or specific information on the changes made in the file.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author has explained the design process of the system by using the flowchart and also they have included few screenshot of the mockup screens and a simple visualization UI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team is using flot javascript library instead of highchart javascript library which the previous team has worked on. Looks like they have chosen the correct design pattern as flot library is more efficient and has rich tools to provide visualization.</p>
<p>As the team is modifying one controller file they could have explained the particular design pattern they are using for that. MVC is most cases.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has provided a clean design process flow of what the system is going to offer with necessary visualization to have the reader understand the design clearly. The design looks simple as almost all the changes are made to the view files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design process shows how the&nbsp;specific&nbsp;screens are displayed by using the decision statements. Good work team.</p>",,,-1,"<p>This particular project is a visualization type and it requires necessary mockups/figures that describe the changes made to the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author has included a mockup screen on how the details are shown to the instructor. Design looks clean and neat. It is easy for the instructor to find specific information which is most important for any UI design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has included mockup graphs and&nbsp;charts on what all operation could be performed. Overall the visualization part is done well by the team after looking over the first review comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Almost all the changes done by the team are in the view and so the test plan is not necessary. Though one controller is being modified by the team, they have mentioned clearly in the test plan on what file they are changing and what the changes are.</p>",,,1,"<p>They have improved quite a lot from the first round of review. I noticed these major improvements:</p>
<p>1. Adding more content to the problem statement</p>
<p>2. Added design workflows to clearly describe step by step of how the user should interact.</p>
<p>3. Testing plan was empty during the first round of review which is now filled, so that's good.</p>
<p>4. Addressed the comments about visuals missing / different ways to represent it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion: It is nice to see significant improvements and you have tried to address almost all the issues. Judging by how your project is, I feel that more diagrams would make it really nice to visualize. You have lot of factors like:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=""language-markup""><code>number of reviews performed, the length of the reviews, the summary of the reviews, whether or not the reviewers uploaded a file in their review, the average ratings the reviewers received from authors</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>They have improved quite a bit from the last submission. They have added more visuals to the design doc which is nice. I mentioned in the previous review about the 2nd image in the design doc. I think that it is lacking more details on the screen and what those charts are. Also, the last diagram seems a little absurd to me personally as I am not able to understand the X, Y axis, what do the colors represent. These details can be very informative to the reviewers.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design does appear to be pretty neat as they are trying to disambiguate things by adding more visuals. But as I said earlier, this particular project seems like it needs lot more visuals than other projects might need. They have definitely improved over time but I think adding more details would be better.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Again, they have certainly put in work and improved a lot from previous submission. They have added work flows which show user interaction which has cleared a lot of things about the project than what I understood earlier. As I said, I personally feel that this particular project topic might need a lot more visuals compared to other reports as you have a lot of graphs, metrics, parameters to deal with and that needs more visuals, details on what graphs represent.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think this is a good enough test plan. They did not have a testing plan earlier which they have now which is nice. I believe it is okay to keep the same tests as the previous version, however adding more additional tests, ensuring the previous work is not missing any required test cases would be something I would include in the doc.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team did an excellent job concisely explaining what the problem is and what they need to change to enhance the visualization for instructors.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Everything is well-organized, all sections are descriptive to the point. They have added the testing plan and more visual aid since the previous submission. Good job!</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design is very clear, no clutter, the flow is intuitive and very easy to follow.</p>",,,-1,"<p>With&nbsp;the second submission the team did a great upgrade of what they had for visualization before. More charts, more explanations, a nice graphical process diagram, all were dded to enhance the design document.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The team mentions to add RSpec tests.</p>,,,1,<p>The chart showing stacked bar charts could be simplified to make it easier to see the relative percentages of teams in each scoring range.</p>,,,1,"<p>The test plan is described but not in much detail. I am sure once the design is complete, the authors will come up with a detailed test plan.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have painstakingly explained every aspect of the project in great detail. The doc is very well written and is easy to follow. Visual aids are added wherever required. They have done a very good job.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design that has been proposed is very sound and easy to understand. The mock up screen they have provided is very intuitive and follows appropriate principles.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design is simple and very easy to understand. They have proposed various options that are possible. All the designs are very intuitive and easy to follow.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have added visualizations wherever needed and it makes the doc very appealing and easy to follow. The graphical flow of the process is apt and easy to understand.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design includes test plan. The main task here is refactoring the previously written code. They intend to test all the functionalities possible.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the authors have adequately explained the changes.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has explained the design well with the help of graphs and flow charts which i had suggested earlier. I am able to understand the flow due to this.</p>,,,1,<p>The selection of data representation could be handled in a better way. Instead of going to the pie chart and then depending upon the decision clicking on the stat plot is a bit redundant. You could improve this by giving the choices at the start itself.</p>,,,-1,<p>The diagram does represent the project clearly.</p>,,,-1,<p>The team has included a test plan but it's not clear what changes they will be making in it or how a user can test the changes made manually.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the authors have improved their explanations considerably. More graphics have been added, and I can easily understand the purpose of the project. I would still suggest that you add more depth to your test plan because it seems lacking, but you at least address the test plan so I will award most of the points. I would suggest that you make additions numbered tests, and while it may be difficult to determine the nature of these tests they should at least be written at a high level so I know you have done them.</p>",,,1,"<p>Aside from the missing test plan, I believe the design will work. I would suggest adding a UML so that we can see any potential design patterns you are using. At this stage, I appreciate all the visuals to aid my understanding, but a UML would be more appropriate than a graphical process flow.</p>",,,1,"<p>Without the UML it is difficult to tell the simplicity of the design, but based on the mock-up of the webpage I believe that the implementation&nbsp;will be as simple as possible while also communicating the appropriate information.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think the visualizations are excellent and one of the best parts of this wiki. I appreciate the addition of the mock-up of the graphs you will show instructors. The only issue I had is that you do not have the UML diagram, but since I have already removed points for that I will not remove them here. Overall this section was great.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The section is included, which is great. I feel that even though you cannot test the graphs you should still name some tests for the RSpec&nbsp;API so that there is clear documentation of the tests.</p>",,,-1,"<p>1. Yes, the block diagrams are helping in getting an overview of the project</p>
<p>2. Mockups added for better understanding</p>",,,1,"<p>1. A bit more of explanation could be added for understanding how the code flow would work</p>
<p>2. A better overview could be provided by explaning the functions of&nbsp; each file and the functions that are required to be modified&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>1. since it is a refactoring code, I believe that the code would be highly modular from what is understand from the design of the project</p>
<p>2. A bit more details about the previous work would help us explain better the actual work that is to be done in this project</p>",,,1,"<p>1. good amount of visualization used, however they could be explained in a better way using some description for each digram&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>1. The design plan is described in a very brief manner</p>
<p>2. They could use some tools to better understand on what factors are they going to measure the performance</p>
<p>3. Corner cases could be explained to understrand the test plan and show if there are any tradeoffs possible</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have improved the documentation after previous comments. There have added the application flow diagram which is very helpful. The authors have clearly mentioned the changes they want to implement.</p>,,,-1,<p>Since this project is related&nbsp;adding reports. The designs&nbsp;are mainly UI changes. The authors have given an application flow of their changes. The design of the flow seems reasonable. They have also provided mock-up design images&nbsp;that are very helpful.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Given the requirements that are mentioned, the design is crisp and to the point. The authors have done a good job explaining the various elements of the design. They have provided application flow diagrams as well as mock screenshots to support the same.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have provided application flow diagrams to explain the flow of the UI for their design. They have also added mock screenshots of the graphs that they will project on the UI. They have added all the required figures to explain the changes that they wish to do.</p>,,,1,"<p>This is a feature development project. Most of the development is centered around graphs. But still there is a scope of testing around authorization of the application flow. For example:</p>
<p>1. A graph is only visible to the intended user. Reports for teacher 1 cannot be visible to teacher 2.</p>
<p>2. The link to the graph must be present at the expected location.</p>
<p>Such test cases can be done via rspec/capypbara. The team can add them. The rest of it can be done by manual testing.</p>",,,-1,<p>Very well explained. Used pictures to show their intended changes.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>Seems like all the section are there and are well explained.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. Easy to follow and understand. Lots of pictures are used which helps.</p>,,,-1,<p>Lots of figures and diagrams used to explain what the existing expertiza and how they plan ot change it.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. They mention that they will refactor some of the previous team's code and add new&nbsp;tests based on the features they add.</p>,,,1,<p>The code follows good Ruby on Rails coding practices. The models clearly describe the relationship between different tables of the schema and contains validations including regex validations for email. The controllers contain code for basic CRUD functionality. The views do not contain the logic and are used only for displaying necessary information to the user. Two space indentation was used instead of four space indentation. The team used DRY concepts and I couldn't find code duplication. The only odd thing was an empty homepage controller and also no validation for website field of company.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Deployment:</p>
<p>The application was deployed on the Heroku platform and the corresponding github repo was also shared. The deployment was done properly and I had no issues opening up the application and running it. As soon as I clicked on the deployed app link, I was redirected to the home page of the system, which was the login page. The database migrations were also done properly as I was able to register and login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;User interface:</p>
<p>The user interface was minimalistic and easy to use. Everything was self explanatory and most pages were linked properly. Only the back button of the view job applications page was wrongly linked, otherwise everything was fine.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I could see that the team had tested four controllers, namely, <span class=""css-truncate css-truncate-target"">companies controller, job applications controller, job posts controller and users controller. However, none of the models were tested.<br /></span></p>",,,1,"<p>There were only 6 commits in total, that too by one person and four of those commits were after the deadline. For future projects, I would recommend to start pushing early and have more frequent commits. This will ensure continuous integration practices are followed.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code follows the good ruby and rails coding practices.</p>,,,-1,<p>The interface is easy to use.</p>,,,1,"<p>The admin model hasn't been tested at all. The configured email and password is not being authenticated.&nbsp; When the show button is clicked while viewing the company/job information , the recruiter is being able to edit the job &amp;/ company info even if not belonging to that company. Furthermore, if a recruiter leaves a company, the jobs created by him/her are retained and can be edited/destroyed by the same recruiter which shouldn't happen according to the spec file. All these things should be take care of . You just have to put certain conditions in the appropriate views to display links to certain pages.</p>",,,-1,<p>The major problem which was observed during the last review still exists. There are few commits to judge the changes which were pushed through in the given span of time.</p>,,,1,"<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml>

<p>1) The job seeker is associated with a company by default which needs to be changed.</p>

You could consider setting up a git fork that you'll be working on and adding it as necessary external links.</p>,,,-1,"<p>In the Proposed solution section, the team states ""<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">However, they will increase the benefit that each person gets because they can get feedback that is specific to their project."" I am not sure how each person is benefited. The project document states that the grades don't have to be considered as the questions will be too easy. Is so, how will the project ensure the quality of questions, especially since they are not graded.

The functionality is definitely all incorporated.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes , the design proposed by the team looks neat for most of the part and doesn't look smelly. It mostly involves changes in the migrations and the views and thus seems to be pretty DRY. It should be fast and should solve the mentioned problems.</p>
<p>However, I have a few suggestions. Firstly I can the whole design and correlation would be neater if a separate table was created for the supplementary review questions and linked to the teams with a foreign key instead of just creating a column and populating it with the ID every time a questionnaire is created. Inside the subclass created they can have a no review method which can be checked every-time to check if supplementary questions are added.</p>
<p>Also this team had stated that the supplementary review questions added are not be graded. But in the flowchart, it is said that the scores of these extra questions are appended to the review scores. But my question is if these extra questions are not graded, why score them at all and add their scores.?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in the test plan , it says some tests need &nbsp;to be added for response controller and the assignment controller. However , I suggest if you think through these tests and include them in the doc, it would be great. This way the reviewer can understand what corner cases are you thinking of and maybe come up with some cases of their own which would improve your tests.</p>",,,-1,<p>This design doc incorporates all the functionality required</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the team has covered all the requirements stated in the problem statement.In the Changes to User Interface section, the team has just restated the problem statement. Explaining it in your own words would be better.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design incorporates all of the functionality required.</p>",,,1,<p>The team mentioned the files to be modified. If possible addition of a little bit more finner details will be really helpful to answer this question&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The UI is highly unintuitive. Except for the login and sign up pages, it is very difficult to navigate through the other pages. In a number of places, the back button leads to an unexpected page. Some things I noticed are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It isn't possible to edit user profile information - we can only view it. For a recruiter, we can edit profile information while linking them to a company but not after that.</li>
<li>The job filtering mechanism does not work.</li>
<li>As a recruiter, clicking on ""View Applicants"" lists every applicant to every job.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As a job seeker, while applying for a job, it is not clear what has to be entered in the&nbsp;<strong>application&nbsp;</strong>field.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As a recruiter, while creating a job, it isn't clear what needs to be entered in the&nbsp;<strong>job&nbsp;</strong>field. Also, the recruiter is asked to select his company while posting a job - not sure why this is required.</li>

There's a <em>lot</em> of discussion of tables, but that's not what's going to be used (I hope?), so more clarity on how the objects look would be nice.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team's RSpec tests are well-written to check all of the functionality of the collusion_cycle model. Since all tests pass, the model code is ready to be deployed.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has mostly figured out as to where the changes need to be made. And the design for most part seems to be sound. However, like states earlier, I am not too sure of whether the design should be as stated.

However, at some places the explanation is too brief and is almost just stating which is given in the problem statement. I would suggest , that they can explain the solution of each problem in a some detail so that it is easier to understand. Maybe a few examples can be added to aid understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also one thing I would like to point out that the first flowchart is not clear. The flow is quite distorted as it connects the instructor views with the student . I don't think thats quite accurate. Instead a separate flowchart for the instructor side and the student side can be created. This would make the flowchart easier to follow and also track the data flow.</p>
<p>In the first flowchart, there is a design box with only one path without any indication for yes and no. I would suggest to fix this before the next submission.</p>

There are both arrows that turn into other arrows at corners and lines that properly continue through the corner. There are places where multiple control flows combine into one and there's no combination diamond there, they just awkwardly kinda kiss</p>
<p>These are flow diagrams that have blocks like ""Instructor"" and ""Student (team_id)"" and ""Your Work"" that are clearly not actions that are being taken. There's also no start node or end node in any of them (the little black circle in a white circle and the other little black circle that's on its own)</p>
<p>There's also a decision block (is SRQ enabled?) that has one exit and no condition on said exit.</p>
<p>They would definitely be useful if they were actually UML flow diagrams, I'm sure, but they're mostly just confusing. The first one is probably unnecessary, though. It just kinda looks like a list of buttons the user is pressing.</p>
<p>The screenshots are nice, though. Love those.</p>",,,-1,<p>The changes that the authors seem to have proposed are explained well and are well aligned with the requirements of the problem.

It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly for most part. However I am not too clear on how the grading will work. Initially it is mentioned that these supplementary questionnaire will not be graded but the UML diagram mentions that the SRQ scores would be appended to the original review scores. Also I'm not sure as to whether these would be optional or not. If they are optional, I believe people wouldn't be keen on answering them. If they are not graded, it is not fair for some people reviewing to do additional work in reviewing the team's work. It could be added as an optional bonus if answered.</p>",,,-1,"<p><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">&nbsp;cycle_similarity_score and cycle_deviation_score test cases have been tested well with using 2,3, and 4 nodes tests.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">Two_node_cycle method has been shown and it was used to explain how second_node_cycle, and third_node_cycle tests were implemented.

I am not sure how each person is benefited. The project document states that the grades don't have to be considered as the questions will be too easy. Is so, how will the project ensure the quality of questions, especially since they are not graded. Students might be tempted to skip these questions all together.</span></p>",,,-1,"<p>The design appears to be very sound. The authors have clearly thought out the implementation and design process. This is obvious from the files list they have added, and the detailed implementation details they have provided. None of the problems mentioned above seem to exist.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes , the design proposed by the team looks neat for most of the part and doesn't look smelly. It mostly involves changes in the migrations and the views and thus seems to be pretty DRY. It should be fast and should solve the mentioned problems.</p>
<p>However, I have a few suggestions. Firstly I can the whole design and correlation would be neater if a separate table was created for the supplementary review questions and linked to the teams with a foreign key instead of just creating a column and populating it with the ID every time a questionnaire is created. Inside the subclass created they can have a no review method which can be checked every-time to check if supplementary questions are added.</p>
<p>Also this team had stated that the supplementary review questions added are not be graded. But in the flowchart, it is said that the scores of these extra questions are appended to the review scores. But my question is if these extra questions are not graded, why score them at all and add their scores.?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in the test plan , it says some tests need &nbsp;to be added for response controller and the assignment controller. However , I suggest if you think through these tests and include them in the doc, it would be great. This way the reviewer can understand what corner cases are you thinking of and maybe come up with some cases of their own which would improve your tests.</p>",,,-1,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The team followed the program descriptions, and included the information of their test in README, which helped to&nbsp;place their test easily.&nbsp;Company's model&nbsp;is thoroughly tested with RSpec.

They have proposed to make an extra view where the users(students) can add extra questions in the review,&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has mostly figured out as to where the changes need to be made. And the design for most part seems to be sound. However, like states earlier, I am not too sure of whether the design should be as stated. It takes a lot of effort for a reviewer to review a work and burdening him with additional work should come as optional and with a bonus to provide incentive.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Not a ton details (like classes) were added to the design document.&nbsp; However, of all the details that were added, none of them are ""smelly"" or seem to have any problems.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>This is a good design for the task at hand</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the diagrams added are very helpful.

There are both arrows that turn into other arrows at corners and lines that properly continue through the corner.

<p>These are flow diagrams that have blocks like ""Instructor"" and ""Student (team_id)"" and ""Your Work"" that are clearly not actions that are being taken. There's also no start node or end node in any of them (the little black circle in a white circle and the other little black circle that's on its own)</p>
<p>There's also a decision block (is SRQ enabled?) that has one exit and no condition on said exit.</p>
<p>They would definitely be useful if they were actually UML flow diagrams, I'm sure, but they're mostly just confusing. The first one is probably unnecessary, though. It just kinda looks like a list of buttons the user is pressing.</p>

<p>However, I feel that there is some extra information on the wiki as well. As this is a wiki page for the project,I would suggest putting the information about Test Driven Development and Unit Testing as embedded links or maybe at the end of the document as it is does not serve as an introduction to the project but rather gives a background to the project.

However, I noticed that you have named your test menu item variables as ""test1, test2..."". This is slightly misleading as the name ""test1"" seems to imply that this object represents a test, rather than a menu item. Consider changing this before merging with the original repo.<br /><br /><br /></p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a good job planning out their course of action for their project.&nbsp; The Test Plan does a good job covering the over all scope of the project.&nbsp; I like how the team has described what each method that needs to be tested does, and then goes on to give an example of how they will test that method.&nbsp; One area that could be improved is edge cases.&nbsp; I did not see any reference to them at all.&nbsp; This could be due to there not being any, but it would be helpful if you touched on that just a bit.&nbsp; Over all good job!</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has done a good job covering all of the required points in the the final project description.&nbsp; The description required that the team create a new file named ""users_controller_spec.rb"" which they have&nbsp;described in their project design document. &nbsp; It also states that the team does not need to test private or protected methods, but needed to achieve at a minimum, 90% path coverage.&nbsp; The team did a good job covering this in their design document as well.&nbsp; All in all the team has done a good job incorporating all of the functionality required into their design doc.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a really good job explaining what each method they will test does.&nbsp; They have also given the RSPEC test case headers that they will be using to test each method.&nbsp; While this does a pretty good job explaining what will be tested, it might help to add a short explanation for each test.&nbsp; For instance, under the ""Create"" method, one of the described tests states, ""Is this the name new?&nbsp; If yes, good.&nbsp; Otherwise, register the user by email address""&nbsp; This is a bit confusing to me, as I don't fully understand what is going on.&nbsp; It seems to be saying if the name is new, then don't register a new users, but this seems contradictory to the idea of a ""create"" method? Because of this, it would be nice to have some added explanation attached to each test.&nbsp; Other then that though, everything looks good!</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design appears to be very sound.&nbsp; Since the team is just testing one file, they only need to edit/create one test file and their design document reflects this.&nbsp; Great job.</p>",,,-1,<p>The visual aids that are included in the write up are very helpful in understanding the project scope and design.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Strengths:</p>

That part was not very clearly addressed here&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>Yes they included project purpose which is easy to understand but they&nbsp;didn't mention their plan (didn't explain how they'd plan to complete their goals in steps)</p>,,,-1,<p>Each method is explained clearly. It is very easy to follow.</p>,,,-1,<p>The above mentioned problems do not exist.</p>,,,1,"<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Flow chart added to explain the methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above mentioned problems do not exist. This project does not seem to require UML diagrams or mockups.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, in their design description I can see all the required functionalities are covered which is good. However it's better if they can include a design plan/project plan to illustrate how they'd plan to meet the requirements&nbsp;in steps. They did write ""<span style=""background-color: #f9f9f9;"">The scope of our project is to rectify these problems by performing the below steps</span>"" but&nbsp;I think these &ldquo;steps&rdquo; are just the copy of the requirements and it's too abstract to figure out what they&nbsp;thought&nbsp;around these requirements.</p>",,,1,"<p>The explanations for the proposed changes are straightforward and quite easy to understand but they are almost the copy from the requirements, so I'd recommend they discuss them in detail. For example, for ""<span style=""background-color: #f9f9f9;"">1. Go through the Expertiza_development database to find tables that not used any more or redundant records.</span>"" they may explain the criteria they decide to use to find the useless or redundant tables.</p>",,,1,"<p>Their goal is to regularize expertiza database schema so they won't add methods/classes.</p>
<p>From wiki it seems they just started their project and there's no code written yet, so I'd say more effort should be expended on the design.</p>",,,-1,"<p>They included the old detailed description of the tables in Expertiza DB schema which is really descriptive. But for now it's hard to say whether it's helpful and necessary to help reader understand the project, however I guess when they almost finished their tasks they will update a rectified DB table&nbsp;on wiki, so at that time by comparing the rectified and old table, it will be very helpful for readers to figure out their project purpose and how they achieve them. Anyway, the table is well designed and shows their intentions.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design doc lists the project purpose and project design in a sense by listing objectives. The project invovles regularizing the database schema so it is understandably difficult to produce a project design like a mock up. However, the&nbsp; suggested changes do not go into much detail and are not well documented. Listing few sections of the wiki that will be updated would have added to the completeness of the doc. In addition, the testing plan was hard to extract, and doesn't go into much detail. I think overall, the team should add headings to the document that clearly outline what the problem and background of the project is, what their suggested solutions are, and a description of each solution. Also they should have a seperate section for a test plan. &nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design copy and pasted the required funcionalities listed on the main document, so yes, objectively the design does incorporate them somewhat. However, the actions that team stated they will take are not very detailed, so it is difficult to guage whether or not the requirements are being met.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors need to be more explicit about the changes they will make. It is good that the team communicated that they will update the wiki to reflect the current DB schema, however instead of stating the potential changes, the structure of the entire wiki was instead presented. I think once the team dives a bit deeper into the project, they will be able to provide the names of the DB tables that were changed or removed.</p>",,,1,"<p>Overall, the scope of the project seems sound. It is difficult to guage whether or not the changes will have potential risky effects to the application without knowing which parts of the DB are being altered. However, as long as the team does go back update the doc with the details of their changes, it will become easier to analyze the effectiveness on the design of the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>No visual aids were used, and it would be a bit tricky for the team to include any on this one. However, screenshot of how various tables in the DB are linked together presently would have been a nice use of visual aids. I would suggest somehow providing a visual aid that helps provide the rationale for each change made to the DB. This would allow for more understanding regarding the project and the impact of the changes.</p>",,,1,"<p>The project purpose and some information on the issues present in the old design was given. However, the implementation plan is extremely vague and very short, and no information on the test plan is given.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design does not describe how it will incorporate all of the required functionality,&nbsp;but it does claim that it will, and it describes several specific requirements that will be completed.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors proposed to review the DB schema and update the Wiki. However, no more detail at all was given, and as such it is difficult to gauge the quality of the explanations present.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors did not describe what design changes they plan to make, only that they will make changes.</p>",,,1,"<p>The item most similar to a visual aid is a list of DB fields given, which is not immediately useful if not accompanied with an explanation of what is being modified.</p>",,,1,"<p>They explain the project purpose well, but when they explain the design, or what they will do satisfy this purpose, I feel they could be more explicit. Perhaps in the resubmission they could explain the exact places they will look and files that will most likely end up being changed, but this document is fairly lacking as it is. Also, the testing plan only states that they will ensure previous tests work. What are the pivotal tests that must work? Graphical inclusion would be a great idea, and im not sure listing the entire documentation is too great of an idea too because its rather confusing and doesnt actually explain what&nbsp;<em>their&nbsp;</em>contribution will be.</p>",,,1,"<p>After reading these requirements document, i actually realize that everything on the wiki was a cut and paste, so they actually don't have any design determined yet. They do satisfy incorporating functionality, but I would think it would be great to see how they will go about accomplishing these tasks in their own words.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There were actually no explanations given because they don't have any of their own design plans documented, just what was placed in the requirements document. I think they can come up with their approach, or a few, and explain them.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think the plan laid out could work out, but they will have to be very cautious because this is a fairly destructive project. Also I think they will have to make sure to be on the same page and double check each other before they decide to make changes. I definitely think more effort should be expended on the design as there doesnt seem to be much design as of yet. If they perhaps make it a modular design where they effectively peruse each DB table, maybe they can come to a more coherent and logical design they can then document.</p>",,,1,"<p>They do not provide any visual aids, which I think would be a great idea. Perhaps including a mock-up DB table that would then be able to show how thios project would impact expertiza. Or maybe there is some metric whereby cleaning up the extraneous references that are unneeded would affect it, and they can somehow visually represent the impact their design will have.</p>",,,1,"<p>&nbsp;The teams work is to modify the expertiza db to make it more&nbsp;functional removing the db. This message was clearly conveyed&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>. The test plan was not explicitly mentioned . May be the team would need to check if the functionaloty is still maintained if the table attributes are changed , which as said they would run all the tests again&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>&nbsp;Yes , the team's work was clearly conveyed and the same was explained in the document&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>&nbsp;the explanation was crisp for most part . if it was possible to mention how they would plan to check all the attributes in a better way or go through each of them individually . I am just curious</p>,,,1,"<p>&nbsp;The project dosent fall in this catogory of questions. The task is db mogrations to make it more meaniingful, which the team has explained well</p>",,,1,<p>&nbsp;Question not very apt for this project&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>They list the project problems, and the scope of the project and introduce the steps to navigate to expertiza_development schema, which is pretty good. However, i still don't know about their design purpose and plan. I think they still need to tell us what kind of achievement they'd like to get at the end of this project and details of how they will do the project step by step.</p>
<p>Moreover, i think they only write a little contents in this wiki pages. The former half are just the project description provided by instructors. they just added 21 lines to the old wiki page and 12 lines of them are copied from project description.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, They include the content in first link to their wiki page.</p>",,,1,<p>they explained the project very well. But they just didn't talk about details plan.</p>,,,1,<p>this project doesn't need to change or coding something&nbsp; new. it just checks the redundant and name confusion.</p>,,,1,<p>No diagram is used in this wiki. and i wonder if they can use some diagram for their project. But i'd like to see if they can come up with some flow charts for their detailed realization of design.</p>,,,1,"<p>I do understand that there is not a whole lot of explanation needed in the doc, but the team could have done much more than just stating what is to be done without actually explaining anything. The wiki page adds nothing to the project description. The wiki page lists some tables without actually explaining anything about those.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has provided a list of tables without actually explaining if there are some things that need to be regularized or are redundant. The doc is very crude as of now and there is nothing much a person can make out of it. I would have loved if the authors had added some explanation, without which reviewing becomes very difficult.</p>",,,1,"<p>To be honest, I didn't get what the team is trying to propose because of inadequate explanation. If the team would have been a little bit more descriptive, it would have been easy to understand. The have listed some tables as deprecated, but without any explanation.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design doc covers the testing details and it seems to include all details on the methods they would test. I couldn't find anything that is missing based on the requirement spec. So, well done!</p>",,,1,"<p>Apart from just listing some tables as deprecated, there is nothing more added. It's impossible to figure out from the wiki what the authors plan to change or add.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design document looks to have all relevant details about what the team has set out to achieve. They have mentioned all details about the files they are concerned which is good. Most teams seem to miss out on this important detail. Since this is a testing project, they have quite a few tests about how they would test the various methods. You could consider setting up a git fork that you'll be working on and adding it as necessary external links.</p>",,,1,"<p>I don't think this applies to the team, as there are no aids that can be possibly added. That said, the authors could have added a more detailed explanation to compensate for lack of this particular aspect.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Since this is a testing project, the document seems to cover the changes what the team will be implementing and what test cases would be written out. It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Since this is not a design requirement, there seems to be no reason to include any design proposition. But the test proposition seems to be adequate and should improve the system rather than decreasing any response time. Everything good here.</p>",,,1,"<p>The portions that the team added at the top of the write up are good, they explain what is required of the project, and some of how they plan to get those steps done. But the bottom part, the list to all the tables in the DB, seems a bit overkill. The write up does not need to link to every table that will be touched, maybe if you want to include them they can be added in a simple string of links rather than these large blocks? Since they are added I feel there should be some details attached to them as well, like what each is used for, and how you plan on updating that specific one.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>The planned steps mirror whats in the project description perfectly. The team has some ideas written down for how they will accomplish those tasks.</p>,,,1,<p>They have a diagram depicting the current flow for the creation of the users which is helpful. However I do not think any diagram could be expected of testing projects. You could include some screen mockups of when appropriate error messages should occur.</p>,,,1,"<p>I think an example would really do wonders here. Its a bit hard to grasp exactly whats being changed? The word normalize makes it sound like the team will make each table have a similar/the same layout when that likely isn't possible. Maybe show a DB that has a few redundant fields and how you will fix that specific one, and then show the wiki page its connected to, and how you have to update that page?&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design here is rather simple, create migrations to clean the DB, not much to comment or expand on. The team did a good job of keeping it easy to read and follow in the write up.</p>",,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;Reference kept blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The design document appears to complete with all the files associated mentioned&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked that they have considered each method and what functionality they would test in that</p>",,,-1,"<p>No diagrams, but its also not really needed so I didn't put any stars.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design document has mention of all the methods and classes associated one would test</p>
<p>Its good to see all the components present, they have done a good job in designing the document&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a good job covering the projects purpose and the scope of the project as a whole.&nbsp; That being said, the team has not included a UML or Wireframe describing the technical layout of their porject.&nbsp; Furthermore, the team does not appear to have added testing plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the team has not done either of these two things, they seem to be on track given it is only one week into the project.&nbsp; I would suggest though, that moving forward the team focus on getting these technical documents written up so that they can all be on the same page when it comes time to begin implementing everything.</p>",,,1,"<p>While the team reiterates the project description given in the google doc, they do not appear to have worked through any design decisions as of yet.&nbsp; What they have done is go though all of the database tables and given links to them in the expertiza documentation.&nbsp; While this is nice to have, it might be more helpful if just one table is linked with maybe a list of the tables that need to be changed.&nbsp; The project does not require that all the tables be updated and changed, just the ones that are not set up properly.</p>",,,1,"<p>The author does not appear to have proposed any changes out side of reiterating the project description.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this project is mainly focused on cleaning up the DB, I do not feel as though there is really any need for formal documentation such as wireframes or UML documents to be made.&nbsp; That being said, it is important that the team lay out a plan of action so that both reviewers and other team members alike have a good idea what is going on.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team should definitely put some more effort into expanding the documentation.&nbsp; As mentioned above, there isn't really any need for formal documentation such as UMLs or Wireframes, but the team should definitely focus on creating a plan of action moving forward.&nbsp; The team did do a good job finding all of the tables that could need editing, but I would suggest reducing these documented tables down to just those that will be worked on in the project.&nbsp; Other then that, keep up the good work.</p>",,,1,"<p>There are currently no UML diagrams, mockups, or screens and tables.&nbsp; That being said, this is not something that this team necessarily needs given their specific project is focused more on reworking the database.&nbsp; A suggestion for a diagram the team might add though could describe which portions of the database need to be reworked.&nbsp; Visual guides and diagrams really help reviewers and team members alike understand visually what is being worked on.&nbsp; Because of this, I would highly suggest sketching out a visual overview of the portion of expertiza that you and your team will be working on.&nbsp; Other then that, keep up the good work.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Being a Testing project, there wont be any changes but additions to test cases, each of their test cases has a well defined explanation of why this test case might be required.</p>
<p>Based on the number of test cases and functionality they will be testing it can be clearly seen that this will help in improving the over all test coverage</p>",,,-1,"<p>There is no need to have design proposition as this is a test project, the test plan is good and doesnt appear to be smelly and doesnt over complicate the things.&nbsp;</p>

It would better if they can include some background information about Expertiza. In fact, most Expertiza groups did not. But not everyone has the background information. While we are also working on Expertiza, Q suggests us to include the information.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes. They have incorporated all methods.</p>,,,-1,"<p>They have proposed their detailed plan very early, which shows they have a clear idea about the code.</p>",,,-1,"<p>In fact, it is too early to check. Although they have a detailed test plan, they have not covered any code information yet. So do other groups.</p>",,,-1,"<p>They use a diagram to illustrate the new method, which is really helpful.</p>",,,1,"<p>This design document is basically almost finished. Everything in it looks complete and well documented. The only issue I have is that you should create a section called problem statement instead of putting it in the intro. This is a minor organizational issue, and when fixed will merit full credit for sure.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Discusses all possible branches of the test file at length and lists out all used classes.

One small suggestion to make is to resize the photo. It is too large to fit on the wiki and is a bit cumbersome to deal with.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>Methods are added to the appropriate classes, and I think that most of the other points for this section can be disregarded for a test class.

Otherwise, register the user by email address"".&nbsp; This is a bit confusing to me, as I don't fully understand what is going on.&nbsp; It seems to be saying if the name is new, then don't register a new user, but this seems contradictory to the idea of a ""create"" method.&nbsp; Because of this, it would be nice to have some added explanation attached to each tests.&nbsp; Other then that though, everything looks good.</p>",,,-1,<p>The changes are just to add a test script called users_controller_spec.rb and they have included all details about what tests they would make and include in the final file.

<p>Also , I believe that it would have been better if the authors would have included some more information about the peer logic, AJAX and JQuery and how exactly will it be integrated with the design.

<p>I have one suggestion though, it would have been good to include a flowchart or a use case diagram to illustrate the steps of implementation.

This alone is not enough for the reviewers to gauge the performance of this team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the next submission , i suggest to explain the proposed design and the problem statement in detail. Include a flowchart or a UML diagram to explain the functionality and the data flow.</p>

These were not included in the design.</p>,,,1,"<p>I think over all the code is really good and minimal. We used way more models and controllers to make app to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>But I am a little confused by a function defined in user.rb, create_new_user. At first, I thought, this is such a good idea, we went through a lot to make Admin to be able to create a new user. Then, I try to see how it is used and where it is used. But I could not find any.</p>
<p>Another thing, maybe some of the controller code could be included in the model, such as index function in the jobs controller.</p>",,,-1,<p>The code was written with good Ruby and Rails coding practices.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- Proper naming conventions used</p>
<p>- Proper validations done &amp; relationships defined</p>",,,1,"<p>The code followed good&nbsp;ruby on rails coding practices. The code was well-designed. There are a bit of some functionality issues with the admin and job seeker.</p>
<p>Good improvements</p>
<p>1) The team has linked the apply button directly in the job description which is very useful.</p>
<p>2) When the apply button has clicked some fields like job id and company id are auto-filled&nbsp;which reduces the effort of the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points to improve</p>
<p>1) The admin login details mentioned in the README file seems to log in as a job seeker and not as Admin.</p>
<p>2) The admin functionality is similar to job&nbsp;seeker which is suspicious.</p>
<p>3) The recruiter&nbsp;was not able to view the applicants for a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Good coding practices, almost equal commits done by each members</p>",,,-1,"<p>They have followed a very well structured coding pattern, one of the best things i have seen in their application is use of before_action, it shows how the MVC app should be developed,they have reduced the amount of code and redundancy, this is something i loved about their work, other then that indentation naming and other factors are well looked into</p>",,,-1,<p>Overall it looks like it matches common coding practices.&nbsp; The main thing I noticed that could be improved is the use of enums or similar for a lot of the dropdown fields. The options were listed individually in the edit form and also had to be listed again in the model validator.&nbsp; Any updates would have to be done and match identically in both. Enums would let them update in one place for coding consistency and maintainability.</p>,,,-1,<p>The code followed the mvc architecture. All parts of the code look clean . views were dry as required</p>,,,1,"<p>The code is well written with standard naming conventions and use of scaffold generations. All models have thorough validations, and the methods names are self-explanatory without the need for comments. The job-filtering mechanism works very well.<br /><br />However, I noticed that you have hard-coded a lot of option values. For example, you could have used enums to represent Gender, Disability status, Veteran status and Race instead of hard-coding strings. Similarly, you could have used enums to represent the job application status. The benefit of doing things this way would become clear if you decide to make changes to the list of options in the future. For example, if you decide to add another kind of race in the future, you might have to make changes in all the views where these values have been hard-coded. However, if you use an enum, you would only need to change it in the model.<br /><br />I loved your extensive use of page level authentication to check if the right kind of user was trying to do an action. Great work there!</p>",,,1,"<p>The user interface is very clean and easy to navigate. I like they put a long list of companies/jobs/users/applications into several pages. That makes website look really good.</p>
<p>A minor thing, that I notice is when viewing all companies, at the bottom, there is something like this:<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD&nbsp;<a style=""font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; transition: color 0.2s ease, border-bottom-color 0.2s ease; color: #666666; text-decoration-line: none; border-style: initial initial dotted initial;"" href=""https://program2-brody-vishy-ben.herokuapp.com/companies/home"">Back</a><br />=======&nbsp;<a style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: inherit; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; transition: color 0.2s ease, border-bottom-color 0.2s ease; color: #666666; text-decoration-line: none; letter-spacing: 0.975px; border-style: initial initial dotted initial;"" href=""https://program2-brody-vishy-ben.herokuapp.com/"">Back</a><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.975px;"">&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 0c7da1be02e454d46f23808df4a64cf5e5b94933</span></p>
<p>It is a little strange to me.</p>
<p>Another thing is not related to user interface, but I will put it here: ""New User"" link for admin is not working. You might need to fix this.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The User Interface design could have been better.</p>
<p>I could find a few glitches:</p>
<p>1. When I opened the URL of the application, I found that someone was already logged in and I had to logout before I could login in as an admin.</p>
<p>2. After logging in as an admin, the message in the top of the page showed ""ABC"" logged in successfully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>It was ok to navigate but not that easy.&nbsp; Most things had to be done by going back to the home page and restarting from there. Certain fields like the Recruiter company would always reset when editing profile so the user has to be careful with that.&nbsp; Job applications would have been easier with nested urls so the job ID wouldn't be reset if there were any errors.&nbsp; It also would have been nice to be able to see the user's current role when navigating pages as it can be confusing when a user has both roles.</p>,,,-1,<p>User interface was intuitive&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The user interface is very appealing to the eye. The team has put in a considerable amount of effort in the CSS. I particularly liked the use of pagination while listing all jobs/ companies etc.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;there were a few places where it became unintuitive and even the README didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When a user edits his profile, he must enter his password to confirm the changes. While you have used a label above the text field for the password to indicate this, it isn't very noticeable. Every time I tried to save my changes after entering changes, I was re-directed to a ""Something went wrong"" page. It took me a while to realize that I needed to enter my current password in order for the changes to take effect. You can probably add a JS validation saying that the current password is a mandatory field, before redirecting.</li>
<li>Clicking ""New User"" on the admin home page redirects to an error page.</li>
<li>While applying for a job, the current company field is not populated automatically. The user shouldn't be expected to fill this in.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There is no option to switch between recruiter and job-seeker views. The only way to do it now is to go to ""Edit Profile"" and change the user type.&nbsp;</li>

They have also explained why they have taken a particular approach for example in Exceptions in Helper method section, the document explains the issue with the previous code and how it has been resolved .This gives more context while reviewing the code. However in some sections, the reasons for making so could be more specific. For eg:- in the Approach for Refactoring response_report method, the statement ""<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">the controller method originally was sharing a lot of instance variables with the corresponding views, and it has the long switch statements is quite abstract.""

<p>The team has mentioned that they have used factory design pattern however I think that it doesn't quite qualify. The factory pattern lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate.According to the link for Factory pattern provided in the Wiki, the constructor should be made private so that the factory methods are called based on the type of Review report. However, the class implemented by the team just invokes the constructor with different set of arguments. Using a hash table would save some of the code lines.

What I really liked about the wiki page is that they have snapshots of what the previous worked looked like and how it looks after they improved it. This is really impressive as this gives a very clear and fast understanding of what you have worked on. They have also listed out the files that they edited which is really good. They have also explained what Review Mapping Controller is which helped me get an idea of basic functionalities of the code.</p>,,,1,"<p>They have done the best job at this as I can see that they have pasted the piece of code which was supposed to be refactored and the piece of code after they refactored. They&nbsp;have also written about how they broke down the exisiting bulky method into smaller modules and they have also provided the names of those modules along with code snippet. I did feel that certain names were really long, but they did make sense as to what they mean. I would recommend if you can still cut down on the length if possible.</p>",,,1,"<p>I believe they have extensively scanned the previous code and tried to improve the code.&nbsp;They have included the screenshots of the tests in the wiki itself which was apparent. However, I would do a screencast explaining briefly about the project and what a reviewer should expect.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the writeup&nbsp;includes both problems and how they are gonna solve the problems. What's more? They include the files changed by them which is easy for a reader to look into it if they only got the codes instead of github&nbsp;pull request content.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, they do explain why they do it that way. Also, they apply the dry rule to refactor the code.</p>",,,1,"<p>wiki for this project is well written and organized. The hierarchic structure almost covered every thing need to be mentioned: There're ""introduction"", ""problem statement"", ""plan of work"", &ldquo;implementation steps&rdquo;, &ldquo;conclusion and learning outcomes&rdquo; and &ldquo;references&rdquo;. But I'd make 2 suggestions:</p>
<p>1. The &rdquo;introduction&ldquo; part is&nbsp;very long and all about&nbsp;explaining what expertiza, TDD and unit testing are, which I think is not necessary. ""introduction"" should focus more on your project&nbsp;rather than something so general.</p>
<p>2. There's no result shown in the write up such as how many coverage percentage they finally got.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Everything looks good, they also screenshot the result of the&nbsp;test. Yet, they didn't explain details about their test codes.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, it seems they have thoroughly listed and explained every steps they took in detail. But I'm a little confused about the ""expertiza environment setup"" part cuz they didn't include&nbsp;installing bower code in ""setup commands"" which is essential to run expertiza on local host. Also, I didn't find database migration in their setup process.&nbsp;It's a minor problem but I'd recommend making that part complete.</p>",,,-1,"<p>They got Plan of Work instead of Test Plan which I think is almost the same thing. In this section, they concisely present their plan and it turns to be reasonable and easy to understand.

This team is working on unit test for a model, so their pull request just include one newly added spec.rb file which is correct.&nbsp;I'd mention a minor problem: the ""describe-context-it"" hierarchic structure is not used properly. As seen in their code, they used ""describe-context-it"", ""describe-it"", ""context-it"" or ""context-context-it"" for one ""it"" block. It's not clear what the differences are.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The emphasis of the project was refactoring two methods and looking at the work done by the team it is clearly visible that the size of the methods which were to be refactored has significantly reduced, thereby proving that the team has done a good job.</p>

But I felt that at this stage, a usecase diagram and an activity diagram would have been better choices to help explain the problem clearly. There was also no mockups, hence I am deducting 2 points.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Kind of the same problem as before.&nbsp; While the tests pass and seem to be working, I cannot tell what the actual coverage is (the goal of the project).&nbsp; Therefore I cannot tell if the actual goal is met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>I feel that the write up is very well done.&nbsp; The pictures and video really help show that things work.&nbsp; I also really liked how you set up your problem statement and made us clear of the goal.&nbsp; Overall, I would really only add the coverage amount (and prove it with a&nbsp;picture or video).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>It looks they are inspecting the correct class as their project works around the&nbsp;<em>users_controller.rb</em> controller. I think at this point I would ensure you be careful when generating your tests and try to use a DRY approach. I found that correct use of a before(:each) block can truly make code look pretty and less cluttered with the same allow statements. Overall the thought put into creating the test definitely seems sound, I would just look through to ensure you are covering most avenues to acquire that 90% coverage. Otherwise great work so far on the design!</p>",,,-1,"<p>Seeing as everything they are adding is new, I can't see much problem with this. I like how they have already included the context descriptions each test will look into.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Functionality is defined as simply creating the integration tests, which I can see is heavily documented already. I really like the incredible detail you all go into to explain your plan for each method RSpec test.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The document actually looks very thorough and it seems they have considered what they need to do very well. They have included an incredibly thorough description of each method that will be tested thoroughly, the fact that they aim to have &gt; 90% coverage, and an individual testing plan for nearly every method. I think maybe less explanation of each method might be better, but that could just be personal preference. Otherwise it looks great!</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes!!! Even if coverage is not 90% it is still better than before and everything seems to be working.&nbsp; Should&nbsp;not hurt at all to add to production.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The design doc is complete.

The UML diagrams help me understand the project better.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team has done a good job covering all of the required points in the the final project description.&nbsp; The description required that the team create a new file named ""users_controller_spec.rb"" which they have&nbsp;described in their project design document. &nbsp; It also states that the team does not need to test private or protected methods, but needed to achieve at a minimum, 90% path coverage.&nbsp; The team did a good job covering this in their design document as well.&nbsp; All in all the team has done a good job incorporating all of the functionality required into their design doc.</p>",,,-1,<p>Pull request link is not uploaded and I am not able to view the coverage or if the build passes in Travis CI or not.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team has done a really good job explaining what each method they will test does.&nbsp; They have also given the RSPEC test case headers that they will be using to test each method.&nbsp; While this does a pretty good job explaining what will be tested, it might help to add a short explanation for each test.&nbsp; For instance, under the ""Create"" method, one of the described tests states, ""Is this the name new?&nbsp; If yes, good.&nbsp; Otherwise, register the user by email address""&nbsp; This is a bit confusing to me, as I don't fully understand what is going on.&nbsp; It seems to be saying if the name is new, then don't register a new users, but this seems contradictory to the idea of a ""create"" method? Because of this, it would be nice to have some added explanation attached to each test.&nbsp; Other then that though, everything looks good!</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design appears to be very sound.&nbsp; Since the team is just testing one file, they only need to edit/create one test file and their design document reflects this.&nbsp; Great job.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has certainly added test cases and their test cases work, but nothing&nbsp; can be commented about the coverage of the tests.

While we are also working on Expertiza, Q suggests us to include the information.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes. Form Proposed Implementation, I can tell they really understood the requirements and figured out how to implement in steps.

Also, very little code has been added in the new commits. A single line of code has been changed to fix a typo in the name of the test. Rest of the additions is in the comments</p>",,,-1,<p>I think the Test-Plan was very well done and everything is easy to follow. One small suggestion to make is to resize the photo.

<p>More tests can be added. For eg- the first test only checks if a name for the menu is present. However, I feel checks should be made for the naming convention. This will help maintain uniformity throughout all projects.The team has checked if a menu name is nil. Similarly, tests could be written to see if an invalid name is entered. Also the test case 7.2 is just a slight extension of test case 7.1. I wonder if an additional test is required for the same.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The writeup is very detailed and easy to understand.

<p>1.Is the variable dutyId necessary in Duty? because I think rails can&nbsp;auto generate ID for any created model itself.</p>

<p>However, one small problem that I encountered is that , in the files to be modified section, they have only given a very high level explanation of what they intend to do. Thus , while their ideas and design are clear , their implementation plan is not apparent to the reviewers. For example - in the response controller file, they have mentioned that these are the files that need modification. I believe they should have specified what types of medications are required and whether they need to modify an existing method or create new methods.</p>

<p>From what I can say there would be a need to add controller, model and view of duties, in the duties table should there be a reference to rubric associated with the duty, also the primary key would be based on the name of duty and instructor id, it would have been better if they mentioned this in the files to be added&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The team had made a very good attempt in explaining the changes .

It mentions how the reviewee is benefited by asking the questions. However, I feel that the wiki misses out on explaining how the reviewer is benefited for doing extra work. Maybe the team can talk to the instructor on as to how to address this.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I couldn't find the project name on github easily, had to search for it due to different name.I can see the the changed code on github. But the authors have not provided explanation everywhere for the changes.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think almost all sections are there. The only one missing is the background information for expertiza itself. While I already know about expertiza I think it would be appropriate to include a background section saying what expertiza is and get more specific about how this project will benefit the Expertiza project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other suggestion I would make is to either put references in the references section or have them referenced somewhere in the wiki. You currently have no references. You could add references to things like TDD, Expertiza, your own GitHub&nbsp;repository, etc. to help flesh out the document.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Since this is a test suite I believe that the design revolves mostly around the test plan, which looks great.

They have included a detailed design proposal which explains the concept they have in mind very well. The design is neat and accurate and addresses all the problems in the problem statement. The overall design flow is also accurate and without any fallacies. They mostly require changes to be made to the views such as adding checkboxes and additional questions so that part of the implementation would be DRY.</p>
<p>They have mentioned that they will be creating a subclass of questionnaires controller called SRQ. However , they haven't provided any implementation details such as what methods this class would have. Since it is a subclass of the questionnaires controller, I would suggest to use inheritance to its fullest.</p>
<p>Also, I did not really understand how exactly the appending of the questionnaires would work. I would suggest to include some details about how this appending would function which would make it easier to understand for the reviewers.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have clearly explained what they have planned to do.

They have covered most of the necessary information about the proposed design and is easy to follow.</p>
<p>However, there are some parts in the design that needs some more explanation and can increase the complexity. One thing , that I can think of is that they have mentioned that the scores for the questions added by students would not be graded. They have not specified , how they are going to differentiate the two types of questions and how exactly would this logic function.</p>
<p>I suggest to consider such borderline cases and write test cases for it to ensure accurate functionality.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design from the explaination in the wiki shows steps very clearly and they are minor changes in different views and it was in the flow of the general expertiza style&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>The proposed design is very simple and very intuitive.

The authors have done a very nice job with the use of flowcharts</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the visuals added in this doc greatly assist in understanding the overall design of the authors.

<p>However , I would have loved to see a UML or a use case diagram which would have made the data flow across models controllers and views quite clear. The exact processing order and data movement would have been made clear with a UML and the different scenarios can be covered with a use case diagram. This would have strengthened the doc submitted by this team.</p>",,,-1,"<p>A very good work was done with viscualizations , every click was explained with a view that made is easy to follow</p>",,,1,<p>More comments are needed.</p>,,,-1,<p>The authors have taken into consideration feedback from the 1st round and improved the flowcharts. It makes much more sense now and is easier to comprehend.

However, in my last review, I had identified a part which is repeated in multiple controller methods and had suggested to make a separate function for it for DRYing out the code.

The problems are explained in detail along with the proposed solution. The unimplemented functionality is mentioned which is neat and helps the reviewer in accessing. The result are depicted in the form of screenshots displaying the implemented functionality. This part is done well. However, i think the wiki could have been enhanced if some code snippets were including showing the previous code with faulty migrations and the corrected one. This would enhance the overall understanding.</p>
<p>The proposed model with karma points is impressive.</p>",,,-1,"<p>It does indeed do that. A bit of a shame, since this project is going to make Expertiza even harder to use and understand from a student perspective, but that's not the fault of the team.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has added test cases for the second submission.

<p>I think the newly added tests cover well for this project.</p>",,,1,"<p>The write-up is well documented and the issues are elaborately explained.

<p>Suggestion:Write up could include code snippets of the chnges that are made making it easy for the reviewer to follow the changes.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team added test cases for&nbsp;topic_suggestion_spec.rb.

It's nice to know what the files they'll add and change are, but most of what they're saying is that they'll add a bunch of buttons and checkboxes that let stuff happen, but they don't say how any of that is gonna get done, just ""we will have to add a Boolean field"" or that they'll render a ""java script partial.""</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the team has added a number of test cases compared to their last submission. However, I cannot see the coverall coverage report on their pull request. This may occur as their build has failed and therefore no coverage is reported. So I am unable to review this part. I tried to clone the repo and run the tests manually. However, the specs do not run completely as some of the tests fail.</p>
<p>I would suggest to add tests to check if the instructor is able to edit the comments.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team has added test cases and extensively tested their functionality. But since the build did not pass I cannot see the overall coverage of the tests.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>They're mostly making their own classes, so that isn't relevant.</li>

<li>They don't really look complicated, they just look empty.</li>
<li>Probably not.</li>
<li>Yeah, the design looks like it's in the pre-preplanning phases. For example: Why do Questions have a Questionnaire? Why don't Questionnaires have any Questions? Why does the proposed implementation talk so much about keys to tables, I thought this was supposed to be done with objects? It's just all very confusing and I'm not sure it's nailed down yet.</li>
</ol>",,,-1,<p>Yes. It works very well.</p>,,,1,"<p>Their task was to add new features when managing topics. The team implemented the ideas that were provided by the instructions.</p>

<p>It appears that Question has a single Questionnaire, but Questionnaires don't have <em>any</em> Questions, which doesn't sound like that makes sense.</p>
<p>It also appears that User just has a random line attached to Duty, which isn't a thing in UML class diagrams.</p>
<p>I can definitely see this diagram being incredibly handy for understanding the design if fixed and improved, but, as it stands, it's just confusing.</p>

For these code changes, they have used proper naming conventions to name variables, methods and class names. They have ensured that the newly created variables and methods use the same style as the code that is already present in the model file. I felt that every named item in the code was self explanatory and the purpose of each variable/method was understood from the name.

It was all in a model, where they altered aspect to exclude nil from the calculation. There really isn't too much that had to be added, so i don't think any needs to be extracted into a separate method. They did comment next to a line of code, which is not encouraged, since it can get confusing where to look for comments. Comments should be made before a method is defined on their own separate lines. Other than that, I think the model and testcases added are written in good Ruby style, is DRY, and overall structured in a logical and coherent fashion.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The function is not long at all.

<p>2) I felt the code was already modular and hence no new method is needed.</p>
<p>3) Apart from a couple of comments in the model file, I couldn't find comments anywhere else, especially in the rspec file where they have made a lot of changes in their different commits including the hex codes.</p>

From their wiki&nbsp;especially in ""Proposed Implementation"" it seems they have fully explained the changes they will make to expertiza which includes Migration changes, Instructor view changes and Student view changes, and each of these was quite descriptive and easy to understand. They also listed the files to be modified and files to be created which is very thoughtful. But I want to mention a little problem: in both ""Migration changes"" and ""Instructor view changes"", they gave very detailed descriptions of how to make the changes such as which parameter and method need to be created or modified to realize some functionalities.

<p>Not much else to say about that. Not sure why this isn't a checkbox either.</p>",,,1,"<p>It looks complete to me. You have tested when there is no empties, when there are some empties mixed in, as well as when all the fields were left empty. The only concern I have with the Test Plan section is you using nil and empty interchangeably. This could be confusing, it is best to stick with one, unless you are referring it has two different things then explain when nil occurs separably from empty.</p>",,,1,"<p>Due to the scope of their project, I can say the test plan looks complete. They tested essentially the three types of cases and then variations of them to thoroughly test their model. They test when scores are all non-nil, all nil, and a mixture of the two, which conceivably are the 3 separate blocks of cases. Then they further try tests where you have 0 in some, not in others, or nil mixed in, and it goes on from there. I think they covered all of the scenarios which pertain to their contribution.</p>",,,-1,<p>No new test cases.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yeah.

Although Automated testing was done properly, I don't find any steps to perform manual testing and hence reducing 1 point.</p>",,,1,<p>The team did not include the test cases.

However, Codeclimate indicates 76 fixes to be implemented. Most of them seem to be block similarity issues or methods having too many lines. But those issues cannot be fixed in this case I believe.

So the team could fix that easily.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Based on the wiki, the team has identified most of the test cases they need to deal with for each module that they are working on.

In fact, they have a section well named 'Explanation' which talks about the implementation, and what they changed to enable correct functionality. Another note to point, it explains that the implementation directly corrects the problem they describe earlier on, meaning they talk about nil fields, and then they explain in the implementation how they fix this problem, which is good consistency. They don't explain why necessarily, but I think the explicit way they describe the problem and implementation implicitly answers the question. They did it this way because it leaves out those nil values recorded as an empty score field. They didnt use any design principles or patterns, but simply came up with a simple and quick fix to the issue.</p>",,,-1,"<p>All test cases have been converted as explained in the writeup&nbsp; and the team has implemented this in code as well leading to an increase in test coverage.

Overall very well done.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the wiki clearly indicates the proposed solution of the problem. No design patterns have been used. This is because the controller method that was modified to achieve functionality is relatively small and therefore does not warrant the use of a design pattern.

It mentions the name of the file that was modified and test scenarios are also explained clearly. Screenshots of code snippet were added, which was very helpful in understanding the implementation of the project.

<p>Each line has <em>two</em> numbers on it, though, which is rather confusing. A question has one Questionnaire... or... wait, does a Question have many Questionnaires? It says that Questionnaires have many Questions in the description, but the diagram doesn't quite say that.

I think at this point I would ensure you be careful when generating your tests and try to use a DRY approach. I found that correct use of a before(:each) block can truly make code look pretty and less cluttered with the same allow statements. Overall the thought put into creating the test definitely seems sound, I would just look through to ensure you are covering most avenues to acquire that 90% coverage. Otherwise great work so far on the design!</p>",,,1,"<p>Ultimately I like the idea behind the UML diagram. It seems to me that it is meant to enable the reader to understand the importance of the&nbsp;<em>users_controller</em> and why it is important to create these integration tests. This controller seems to enable new users to sign up and then to be approved by an instructor, which is quite pivotal to Expertiza. Perhaps before next submission you could come up with a few graphics as to the testing interface and how these integration tests will go through and ensure correct operation of the controller.

Only one of the three issues have been fixed. Even though the build passes, there are some code climate issues which needs to be looked at. Unfortunately , this team faced a lot of problems with their interactive menu javascript. Firstly, these issues needs to be resolved. Secondly , since no tests are included, the newly added features should be thoroughly tested before deployment.</p>

If yes, good. Otherwise, register the user by email address"".&nbsp; This is a bit confusing to me, as I don't fully understand what is going on.&nbsp; It seems to be saying if the name is new, then don't register a new user, but this seems contradictory to the idea of a ""create"" method.&nbsp; Because of this, it would be nice to have some added explanation attached to each tests.&nbsp; Other then that though, everything looks good.</p>",,,1,"<p>The code is somewhat ready to be deployed. This team has done a great job in implementing the said features. The code written is concise and DRY. The functionality is working correctly and the tests included are exhaustive.

This team has almost done everything and with a few minor changes , i believe the code is ready for deployment.</p>

There were a few code climate conflicts about a few of their methods, but to be honest I don't consider this a serious problem, since in other aspects of the code in the project, there were pretty large methods that would have definitely failed the same checks.</p>",,,1,<p>As a few issues remain unresolved this code is not ready yet according to me. The functionality of the menu editor needs to be tested and after complete implementation should be deployed on the production server.

The only one missing is the background information for expertiza itself. While I already know about expertiza I think it would be appropriate to include a background section saying what expertiza is and get more specific about how this project will benefit the Expertiza project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other suggestion I would make is to either put references in the references section or have them referenced somewhere in the wiki. You currently have no references. You could add references to things like TDD, Expertiza, your own GitHub&nbsp;repository, etc. to help flesh out the document.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Since this is a test suite I believe that the design revolves mostly around the test plan, which looks great.

But they had a diagram to show how some functions interact with with each other.</p>",,,-1,<p>Very thorough test plan. Seems like the team has given it a lot of thought.</p>,,,-1,<p>The authors have clearly explained what they have planned to do. They identified the controller and associated views that need to be tested and have come up with an exhaustive test plan.

The flowcharts and the mock links added are quite descriptive and makes the ideas of the author easy to understand. They have also corrected the minor errors in the flowchart from the last submission which is great. Overall the document is designed well and the readers can understand it really well.</p>
<p>However, one small problem that I encountered is that , in the files to be modified section, they have only given a very high level explanation of what they intend to do. Thus , while their ideas and design are clear , their implementation plan is not apparent to the reviewers. For example - in the response controller file, they have mentioned that these are the files that need modification. I believe they should have specified what types of medications are required and whether they need to modify an existing method or create new methods.</p>
<p>Thus, I suggest including a short explanation of the exact changes in the files to be modified section will make it easier for the reviewers and the readers to understand and gauge the implementation thought by the authors.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team had made a very good attempt in explaining the changes . They were in a very clear format&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The document is well done and complete. It explains all the changes involved in adequate detail.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the authors have explained the changes that are supposed to be made to the system with enough details. The changes that are supposed to be made in the visual interfaces are mentioned along with a list of files that are going to be altered during the course of the project.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The explanations seem to be much better than the previous wiki explanation. They have also updated their UML diagram to correctly reflect what they are proposing. They have also added appropriate notes for further clarifications that I had. It mentions how the reviewee is benefited by asking the questions. However, I feel that the wiki misses out on explaining how the reviewer is benefited for doing extra work. Maybe the team can talk to the instructor on as to how to address this.</p>",,,-1,<p>Very clear on what exactly the problem is and what your implementation is going to be. The visual aids really helped.</p>,,,-1,<p>Massive improvements on this one from the first round. Good job.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design appear to be sound and follows the appropriate design patterns</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design appears to be quite sound. They have included a detailed design proposal which explains the concept they have in mind very well. The design is neat and accurate and addresses all the problems in the problem statement. The overall design flow is also accurate and without any fallacies. They mostly require changes to be made to the views such as adding checkboxes and additional questions so that part of the implementation would be DRY.</p>
<p>They have mentioned that they will be creating a subclass of questionnaires controller called SRQ. However , they haven't provided any implementation details such as what methods this class would have. Since it is a subclass of the questionnaires controller, I would suggest to use inheritance to its fullest.</p>
<p>Also, I did not really understand how exactly the appending of the questionnaires would work. I would suggest to include some details about how this appending would function which would make it easier to understand for the reviewers.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design was clear and was seen to go on well with the appropriate patterns . They wernt major changes being proposed from code point of view, but everythign was in place</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes the design seems to be sound , the different topics are well explained and seem to have enough information under them. I feel the different approaches or design alternatives could also have been mentioned.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design document looks to have all relevant details about what the team has set out to achieve. They have mentioned all details about the files they are concerned with, which is good. There are no mentions of the design principles or patterns they will be using and this is important since they are building a new model as well. However the UML diagrams mostly depict the approach they plan on using.</p>",,,-1,"<p>At a top level, the design looks good though, knowing expertiza, It may be a little more complex once you start digging into it</p>",,,-1,<p>Massive improvements on this one from the first round. Good job.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design appears to be simple but includes all the necessary&nbsp; requirements</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design proposed by this team appears to be simple and concise. They have covered most of the necessary information about the proposed design and is easy to follow.</p>
<p>However, there are some parts in the design that needs some more explanation and can increase the complexity. One thing , that I can think of is that they have mentioned that the scores for the questions added by students would not be graded. They have not specified , how they are going to differentiate the two types of questions and how exactly would this logic function.</p>
<p>I suggest to consider such borderline cases and write test cases for it to ensure accurate functionality.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design from the explaination in the wiki shows steps very clearly and they are minor changes in different views and it was in the flow of the general expertiza style&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The proposed design is very simple and very intuitive. I believe it will be very useful.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes the design is simple , well explained and consists of all the important details about the project. They have first defined the problem, drawn the design strategy in a graph like manner and then have explained the user interface changes that are supposed to be done.</p>",,,-1,<p>Very simple. They are manipulating current functionality of expertiza&nbsp;to add this feature.</p>,,,-1,<p>The approach the team will be taking seems to be simple and efficient in terms of how I can visualize the system to be.

<p>The flow diagrams are actually valid flow diagrams now!</p>
<p>The screenshots are a bit excessive, but the improvements are clear.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design diagram is visually very appealing. The authors have done a very nice job with the use of flowcharts</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the visuals added in this doc greatly assist in understanding the overall design of the authors. They flowcharts added and very descriptive and make the intentions of the team quite clear. The screenshots with the mock links added also prove helpful in understanding the endoderm goal of this team and how the results would look like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However , I would have loved to see a UML or a use case diagram which would have made the data flow across models controllers and views quite clear. The exact processing order and data movement would have been made clear with a UML and the different scenarios can be covered with a use case diagram. This would have strengthened the doc submitted by this team.</p>",,,-1,"<p>A very good work was done with viscualizations , every click was explained with a view that made is easy to follow</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have taken into consideration feedback from the 1st round and improved the flowcharts. It makes much more sense now and is easier to comprehend. Additional screenshots were added which also helps.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes the team has used a flow diagram and have uploaded screenshots of the changes that are supposed to be made. This makes it very clear to the reviewer where the changes are going to be made.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The UML diagrams are helpful and they have explained it with the use of mockups pretty well and hence I don't feel the need for further details regarding the flow they would take. The images convey what the current system is like. They also have some images depicting how it would look after the changes.They also fixed the previous contradicting UML diagram. So, good work.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Like mentioned before, the visuals were great at pointing to what exactly you are planning to do.</p>",,,1,"<p>It's better if they can describe their test plan with the anticipated test files, e.g.&nbsp;student_review_controller_spec.rb<span style=""color: inherit; font-size: inherit;"">.</span></p>",,,-1,"<p>The tests are pretty limited, but they seem like they would get most the functionality tested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure I would've realized there were any problems if you hadn't told me, though.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design includes a detailed test plan</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, a hierarchical test plan has been included which explains the testing scenarios they have in mind. However I believe that the current test plan included is too short and just provides an overview of testing. Since this team plans on adding a new class and altering views for it, they should thoroughly test the functionality.</p>
<p>I suggest to include a detailed test plan, where each scenario is described and the different tests for that scenario are mentioned. This would enable the reviewer to gauge the test plan and maybe provide an insight into any of the cases that may have been missed by this team.</p>
<p>I scenario that I can think of is that they should test if the correct questions are graded.

What I wish was explained more, was what exactly does&nbsp;on_the_fly_calc_spec.rb do? You explain the places where you need to add tests, but I am having difficulty simply understanding the point as to the model and tests. The names themselves arent even defined enough to provide me the insight, so I would recommend explaining the point of the project in that regard. As such, what functions would performing these tests provide to Expertiza? What do they do? Explaining this would also help me and any other users the ability to understand how the project carries out these calculations and performs its purported function.</p>",,,1,"<p>I suppose my answer to the previous area could be used here as well. Basically, I like the way you explain your plan, but i think it would be very helpful for us and yourselves to explain the true function you are trying to bring, besides just saying you are testing this model, but not explaining what it does. I believe you could definitely come up with a great explanation and then this area would be perfect! To be honest, it looks like its a work in progress, as you have the sections made already, and so I'm sure once you explain the sections this area will be fulfilled.</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes</p>,,,1,"<p>It does in a way include a to-be-added test section, but i'm not 100% if its going to have a more logical format. Before this, they didn't explain their plan beforehand,, which I would recommend a possible next step as well. However, it is yet to be seen what these testing sections will hold, and I cant quite comment on what type of tests they are preparing, because as i mentioned previously, it is not explained what these functions do.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the user interface is easy to use.

If you use the same time of testing returns, you can make a much more DRY and readable testfile this way. I would say i can't quite understand what it is doing, but that mainly goes along with not having these methods explained on the web page too well. The length of some of the tests could be improved by implementing the DRY technique i mentioned already.</p>",,,-1,<p>Tests for only controllers are written. No test for models were found.</p>,,,-1,"<p>There really wasn't much of a Test Plan described, so I can't say they converted the cases.

<p>Another thing they did very good is that they uses model's method in the application model to help listing all the applications for a job seeker. I think we did it in the controller. I like their way better.</p>
<p>I gave 4 stars:</p>
<ol>
<li>because they put a lot of logic in their views, such as index.html.erb for companies and jobs, trying to hide edit/delete button from job seeker or recruiter. I feel what you need to do is using authorization gem such as ""pundit"" to restrict user's ability for some actions on the website. Hiding buttons is good. But I don't think it is enough. Job seeker can still go to ""https://fathomless-brook-57752.herokuapp.com/companies/1/edit"" for editing companies.</li>
<li>(I don't know where to put this point, I will put it here) because I tried to update user's profile, eg ""Name"", but it kept tell me to include ""@"", I felt strange, so I went back to ""views/devise/registartions/edit.html.erb"", yes, you made a tiny mistake in line 16, by indicating that name field is an email field.</li>
</ol>",,,1,"<p>The interface is probably the best among what I review.</p>
<p>They improved a lot since my last review, by indicating what the website is for and what can user do after logging in.</p>
<p>I gave 4 stars, because as an admin, there is button ""Your Applications"" -- I think what they mean is actually all the applications. And there is another button ""Users"" -- I think it is supposed to show all the users, but it will give you the error (page does not exist).</p>",,,1,<p>The test cases could have been commented as they are hard to follow as each function that the tests are written for are calling other functions for which the tests call mocks .</p>,,,1,"<p>Most of the code is straightforward scaffold generated code. So,it is easy to follow and well-written. The method search_companies is defined in ""search.rb"" file i.e.in the Model file. This can be done in the controller to clearly separate the M,V,C components of the architecture.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>I don't think the team has tested thoroughly one model or one controller. Is it in the spec folder? There are only three test&nbsp; cases. In the test folder, I only find rails default testing. We didn't do well on testing either. So let us do better next time.</p>",,,-1,<p>two tests of compute total score and compute review hash seems to be working well the rest of the two functions need to be checked as they fail.</p>,,,-1,<p>code was concise and clear</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, they are still updating/fixing their code during Spring Break. I love their work ethic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The writeup is well written and briefly explains all the functionalities. However, the team could have elaborated a bit more about what functionality each of the functions carries out and how these functions are tested.</p>",,,1,"<p>Your code looks great on GitHub!&nbsp; Most of the models, controllers, and views are setup similar to the scaffold build in RubyMine.&nbsp; One thing that I would recommend doing is either in your GitHub commit messages, your ReadME file or in your code, you should document any Ruby files that act as helpers to other Ruby files.&nbsp; For instance, try documenting any Ruby files that work with the gem Devise.&nbsp; I am not familiar with this gem and some documentation on why is it used would be helpful for me or any other reviewer to understand your thinking process for this project.</p>",,,1,"<p>The writeup clearly explains the purpose of the project. But I guess it is found lacking in explaining how the team has implemented whatever changes they have incorporated. The writeup clearly states which functions need to be tested but what these functions do isn't elaborated. Also, it would be nice if you could explain what a particular test is for.</p>",,,1,"<p>There is no explicit test plan section. Hence, it is difficult to know what all cases the team has taken into account. Test for invalid inputs could have been implemented.</p>",,,1,<p>A good practice was used in using helpers and models to implement business logic.&nbsp; The use of a separate Searches table could have been grouped with the companies and/or jobs logic.</p>,,,-1,<p>I couldn't find the team's pull request.

<p>One thing I noticed though that was missing was documentation.&nbsp; One way to improve this would be to add javadoc to the methods.&nbsp; Javadoc helps readability a lot by giving the reader a better understanding of what th emethod does.&nbsp; it also helps give the reader a better understanding of what the method does by giving the reader context.&nbsp; Here is a helpful resource on javadoc for future reference!&nbsp;&nbsp;https://dev.liferay.com/participate/javadoc-guidelines</p>",,,1,<p>Two functions seem to fail and they need to be checked.

The README provides login credentials for default users and like it says there, the app is pretty intuitive.It is very much like currently used job-finding portals. Only concern is that the text displayed in red color in the menu bar is not easily visible.</p>
<p>While searching for jobs using filters, there is a lot of scope for making mistakes while typing the search parameters. It would be easier to have a drop down for the filters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, after clicking back after viewing companies, jobs or job applications, it lands on the index view rather than going back to the previous page. So, we have to click on the Home page again to view all the actions.</p>",,,-1,<p>There isn't much about&nbsp;about this review other than what you mentioned in your Thoughts section.</p>,,,-1,<p>Test Plan is just a template at the moment.</p>,,,1,"<p>The user interface looks very nice and it's easy to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also appreciate the Admin details in the README file so that I can log in as an Admin.&nbsp; There are a couple of things that I noticed that you should consider fixing.&nbsp; First, when I check the ""Sign Up Now!"" button, you should switch the order of the sign up and login page.&nbsp; I think the user should be first treated to the login in page and then if they want to sign up, they can click the sign up button and be directed to the sign up page.&nbsp; Second, I think you should reconsider the way you are handling user roles.&nbsp; While I get what you are trying to do with setting roles other than then Admin to a Boolean, I think the functionality to determine a user's role could be condensed to one column in the Users table.&nbsp; For instance, you can make the User's role a string and maybe have the User select which role they want to sign up as.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can use the Boolean values to display text that displays the User's role if either Is Applicant or Is Recruiter is set to true.&nbsp; Finally, for some of your fields like Company Id or&nbsp;User Id, you should avoid using an increment counter and instead have the User enter the ID assuming that they know what to enter.&nbsp; Otherwise, you are introducing negative Ids in which Database will never have.&nbsp; While your code does handle this error, I feel that it is common sense to avoid stuff like this.</p>",,,-1,<p>The UI is neat and easy to use.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Variables names, methods, and class names look good!</p>",,,-1,<p>Model and controller tests havent been added. Feature tests have been added though.</p>,,,1,"<p>The role selection requirement was to allow the user to switch between roles.&nbsp; The use of a radio button for this would have been better than a checkbox.&nbsp; Also, adding an admin selection for the admin user should be present.</p>",,,1,"<p>I would recommend trying to build your factories rather than creating them.&nbsp; The difference between building and creating is that if you build an object, it won't be saved in the database while creating does save it to the database.&nbsp; The goal of testing is to create objects that you can use for testing purposes, so you shouldn't need to save them in the database.&nbsp; If you do want to do that, I would recommend cleaning your database with a gem called DatabaseCleaner.&nbsp; Also, you don't need to re-introduce factory builds if you are already doing them outside of your tests.&nbsp; You can remove those and your tests should run fine.</p>",,,1,<p>readme file is very simple but didn't miss any useful information.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>Decent number of commits during the project period.

So, well done!</p>",,,-1,"<p>This code is well ready to be deployed onto the production server.&nbsp; As mentioned above, while it doesn't test everything on_the_fly has, it tests more on the important methods on_the_fly uses often for Expertiza.&nbsp; If future teams wants to expand upon this, they wouldn't have much work to do to increase the coverage, but they could implement your cases of considerations mentioned in your writeup.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team's work looks pretty neat with no DRY problems. Every test case is commented. However, the RSpec coding&nbsp;structure is not fully met. According to the provided video&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzkVfaKChSU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=35s which gives a good test structure, every method being tested should begin with 'describe' block, and a condition of the method can be tested in 'context'. For instance, the method #above from menu_item.rb&nbsp;could have been written as: describe '#above' do context 'when&nbsp;an item with parent id'&nbsp; do it ..... end end context 'when an item without parent id' it ..... end end end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the lines are too long. It would be easier to follow the code with some lines being broken.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Most of my complaints in the previous review dealt with the wiki.

The document includes the changes that need to be implemented but does not include much about how these changes will be incorporated. The team has mentioned the files to be modified.</p>
<p>Suggestion: You could add some details in the files modified section like mentioning why the suggested files are being changed and what kind of changes can be expected.</p>",,,-1,<p>I clearly understand. The writeup explains everything.</p>,,,1,"<p>The writeup has definitely improved from what it was last time when I reviewed.

They have well formed sections that gives a nice flow to the task at hand. I did not have to go to the project description file to understand what the project was about. This is well in line with the first iteration. They have also included screenshots to show test coverage as a conclusion which is helpful. But as I mentioned previously, avoid using excessive descriptions about things other than the project description and instead consider providing a link to the user in case he want to reads more (For eg: BDD) as it might be redundant information. Overall, well done.</p>",,,1,"<p>their wiki page is pretty good. if they could add some explanation on their how they make the test plan, the wiki will be much more better.

Suggested changes will prospectively enhance the UI and maintain core functionality as described in the doc.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design was straighforward, and the authors communicated their objectives very clearly.

They also stated that they will provide a demo of the system via YouTube once the project is completed. However, if the team included a few test scenarios and detailed the actions they would take and what their expecting from the view, the test plan would have been more sound and complete.</p>",,,1,<p>There are 63 conflicts most of which are due to space missing.</p>,,,1,"<p>The author has explained clearly on what all changes they are going do to the system, to solve the problem. List of files has been mentioned by the team.&nbsp; Looks like most of the changes are in the view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>They could have explained more on what all changes they are doing in the view for better understanding.</p>",,,1,"<p>The pull request passed the Travis CI build successfully. However, Codeclimate indicates 63 fixes to be implemented. Most of them seem to be spacing and indentation issues. So the team could fix that easily.</p>",,,1,"<p>Since most of the changes are made in the view part, they haven't provided any specific design pattern or principle they are following. From what they have explained in each of the pages, they look sound without any unnecessary changes.</p>
<p>They could have explained any design process or a design flow on how each of the screens are reached for a good understanding.</p>",,,1,"<p>From the screen mockups and the short description they have provided for each of the pages, looks like design looks simple and easier to understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They could have explained about the changes in the files modified section for better understanding in the code level.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has worked really hard to provide great visualization for understanding the project. They have given screen mockups for all the changes they are doing in the Review Report Page, Review Summary Page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great work team. No improvements for this particular section.</p>",,,1,"<p>Since most of the changes are made in the view part, there is no need to create any test plan for the view. Few of the changes are in the helper file, the author hasn't mentioned about creating test plan for that.</p>
<p>My suggestion would to be create a test plan for the&nbsp;helper file review_mapping_helper.rb.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>I am not sure if implementation doubts should be part of the design doc? maybe they should just meet with their mentor to solve those doubts.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the author has adequately explained the changes to be made to the system. The author has used a unique approach of describing the problem and the proposed solution simultaneously throughput the document which is very interesting. The problem statement has been clearly explained by this team and they have walked the readers through the proposed design supplemented with screenshots which makes it easy to understand.</p>
<p>However, they have given an overview of the implementation and have not provided a lot of details about the implementation. It would have been better if this team would have included details of the changes that they intend to make in the code. A use case diagram or a UML could have been included to show the changes that they plan to implement.</p>",,,1,"<p>There aren't any missing sections, I don't think.</p>
<p>The problems I have with the sections that are there are well explained in other questions in this review.</p>
<p>I do think that basically everything should include more details, though, especially the diagram.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design proposed by this team appears to be sound. &nbsp;Most of the changes proposed by this team involves changes to the existing views, mostly enhancing the readability of the page. These changes are in accordance with the DRY principle and no design patterns are required to be used as such.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the methods to be included in the controller for adding different colors to differentiate between teams based on submission has not been discussed in details. It is nice that they have included the files to be changed, but it would have been great if this team would have included an approximation of&nbsp;changes that are required at a code level. Adding the said information would aid the reviewers to better gauge the design&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document is well presented, but I felt that the introduction part could have been written in points , because it is the most important part of the project and if it is written in points, the reader can have an overall understanding of the scope quickly</p>",,,1,"<p>I might include a bit more information in your proposed implementation block. Currently as a dense list of steps its a bit hard to grasp what goal each step has, if you expand for a sentence or two on each one I think it would be perfect. Overall, great job on this, the write up flows well and is intuitive.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design is simple and concise. They have adequately addressed all the problems mentions with the solutions proposed. The design is easy to follow and understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The document is lacking in terms of the exact implementation details of the proposed ideas. The changes in the views have been explained well. However, the changes required at the level of the controller have not been explained in detail. Adding this would have made the document more clear and could have enabled the reviewers to effectively analyze the complexity of the design.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team's wiki seems to be written after they have fully&nbsp;understand the goals of the project and I think they almost got everything needed in their wiki. They got Overview, diagram, Proposed Implementation, Test Plan which is good. But I'd mention that Test Plan is kind of brief. They just wrote what need to be tested, so I'd recommend to include more information about testing such as the to-be-tested&nbsp;files, to-be-created Rspec test files and brief descriptions of to-be-tested methods.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the screenshots added by this team are very helpful in understanding the proposed design. They have pictorially shown the fallacies in the current view layouts and have explained the solution with reference to these screenshots. This has aided me to understand the intentions of the authors. However, I believe additional imagery could have been used to further support the document.</p>
<p>A UML diagram or a use case diagram could have been added to understand the connection and the data flow amongst the various files that are changed. This would have made it easier to understand the implementation that this team has in mind.</p>
<p>Also this is not absolutely necessary , however I feel , including some pictures of how the bar and line graph would look would have enhanced the overall document as it makes the intention of the authors very clear.</p>",,,1,"<p>the Document appears complete</p>
<p>in the proposed implementation: i do have doubt regarding what if one&nbsp;student&nbsp;is doing multiple things&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the files to be modified, it would have been better to include what changes should there be in each file, would give better idea as to why these files need to be modified.</p>
<p>Test plan should be more elaborate: testing before submitting project all the students should have some role</p>
<p>In the new files section rather then mentioning duties table, It would have been better to write about migration script and specify the columns and their data types</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>There is a test plan section included. However, it only states that a video will be added in the document where all the functionality is manually tested as the changes are mostly with the views and are directed towards beautifying the page. While it is true for some of the functionalities, there are various other functionalities for which tests can be written.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p>For example - tests for the controller methods which adds different colors to the team names based on their submission status could be tested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be tested that after sorting , the background colors are as intended.</p>
<p>Thus, I suggest adding such tests to the test plan and thoroughly test the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capybara can be used.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document sections are complete and satisfactorily cover the need, approach, and testing required for the project.&nbsp; It would be helpful to have some diagrams/mockups in the Test Plan or Proposed Implementation.&nbsp; In the test plan section, the word ""role"" should be replaced with ""duty"".</p>",,,1,<p>The design is very well written and the amount of detailed explanation for every aspect of the project is commendable. I don't think there is any aspect in which the doc is found lacking. Great!</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the authors explained the changes on system in detail. They introduced&nbsp;what to do and why for every change.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>The design documentation contains a detailed overview of the project and contains implementation ideas and test plan that they intend to use. They have also included the doubts they have regarding the files that need to be modified and whether the instructor will add a separate rubric for non-duty based questionnaire etc.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The design document was well written. It included all the major details such as project purpose, design(with UML diagram and list of files to be added/modified) and a tentative test plan. The proposed implementation was also explained clearly and the team seems to have a clear idea about how to go about with the project. I liked how they had posed implementation questions in the end of the document and these are probably to be answered as they proceed with the project. I am reducing a point only because a couple of mock-ups would've been perfect additions to this document.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design appears to follow appropriate principles and using appropriate patterns.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, every step in design seems to make sense. And it aims to the targets directly.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, every change on the system is followed by a introducing picture. It is very clear to introduce what happen.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design includes the test plan but just a mention. They say it will be shown on YouTube but maybe not now. I can't find the related link.</p>,,,1,"<p>The design doc has incorporated all the functionality required, except that they did not write the set up steps.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes. Form Proposed Implementation, I can tell they really understood the requirements and figured out how to implement in steps. But I think they may miss something: one of E1818 requirements is that the system can present the correct teammate evaluation rubric based on role(duty) of the team member, but in their wiki I can not find related implementation plans or proposed implementations.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The document covers the changes that the team will be making and seems to know how they'll be tackling them. The previous version of the wiki seemed to lack the list of file modifications they intend to make. However, they have incorporated them now and this seems to make the list of changes complete.</p>",,,1,"<p>The functionality is covered in the proposed implementation section, but this section is too verbose. This may be rectified by adding mockups as stated before.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The changes proposed are mostly to be implemented on the View side and hence I don't think there is any need for a design pattern. However, the changes mentioned seem to follow appropriate principles without any complicated need of changing the controllers.</p>",,,1,<p>The doc incorporates all the functionalities required. The team has done a very good job of trying to explain every aspect in detail.</p>,,,-1,<p>No changes are to be made on the controller side from what the wiki says. Hence it appears that the design will be simple and should easily reflect on the UI.</p>,,,1,"<p>Under proposed implementation, I don't think they need to explain each step they are going to use for the problem, instead, they should focus on describing their ideas, which would be enough.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I have very little idea what they're actually going to change or how they're gonna change it. It's nice to know what the files they'll add and change are, but most of what they're saying is that they'll add a bunch of buttons and checkboxes that let stuff happen, but they don't say how any of that is gonna get done, just ""we will have to add a Boolean field"" or that they'll render a ""java script partial.""</p>",,,1,"<p>They wrote the potential changes in Propose Implementation which is quite easy to understand and followed the requirements. But it's just too short, details of implementations are not discussed and it's almost a copy of the requirements, so I'd recommend apart from Propose Implementation&nbsp;they may write Implementation Plan which discusses each proposed change in detail and includes newly-added files, classes, methods, variables and their functionalities.</p>",,,1,"<p>My response would be the same as the first round. There are no UML diagrams but they have explained it with the use of mockups pretty well and hence I don't feel the need for further details regarding the flow they would take. The images convey what the current system is like. Would be nice to have a few visuals on how it would look after changes being made, but well done.</p>",,,1,"<p>One change I would suggest in the proposed implementation is adding the files which would be affected by the change proposed or in the file modification adding what this change is for.</p>
<p>The proposed changes no where mention when the instructor will add questions related to each role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>overall the proposed implementation gives a good idea what&nbsp;one might need to do to accommodate this change .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>These changes are difficult to visualize.&nbsp; Adding one or two mockups with arrows with the bullet points pointing to the relevant section of the mockup would be helpful.&nbsp; For example, the bullet item ""When a student goes to &ldquo;Your team&rdquo;, he should be able to select a duty from a drop down menu."" may be better shown with a screenshot of the ""Your team"" page with the added drop-down and an explanation of its function.</p>",,,1,"<p>The wiki says the test plan is to manually test the wiki and then provide a video recording covering the changes which is good. However some of the tests could be covered using Capybara testing, since it mainly deals with UI. The team could look into that since test scripts are an important part of the applcation to ensure correctness.</p>",,,-1,<p>The doc is very descriptive and well written. It is very clear what the changes are going to be and what is expected of these changes. The authors have done a great job of covering all the aspects of the project.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design appears to be sound. It is very intuitive and follows appropriate design principles.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The design document is very well written. The problem statement and suggested solutions were described in detail. In addition, screenshots were used effectively to illustrate the problem statements <strong>and</strong> the proposed changes. The test plan is also very thorough as well, listing each problem, solution, and how to test it. Overall, this is a great wiki.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design is very simple and makes certain metrics easier to understand. Also, it adds to the visual value.</p>",,,1,<p>There are plenty of visualizations to help make life easier. There are screen mock ups provided for some changes. I would have loved if there were a bit more screen mock ups to help things more clear.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The design incorporates all of the funcitionality required and described in the problem statement. The specifics of each functionality is addressed, and the proposed solutions designed to implement them are well described and illustrated in the&nbsp;<strong>proposed solutions&nbsp;</strong>section. It is apparent that this team has a very clear understanding of the scope of the project and have put a good amount of thought into the design of the solutions.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<ol>
<li>They're mostly making their own classes, so that isn't relevant.</li>
<li>I think this code might be adding a lot of confusing relationships and putting in methods places they might not belong.</li>
<li>They don't really look complicated, they just look empty.</li>
<li>Probably not.</li>
<li>Yeah, the design looks like it's in the pre-preplanning phases. For example: Why do Questions have a Questionnaire? Why don't Questionnaires have any Questions? Why does the proposed implementation talk so much about keys to tables, I thought this was supposed to be done with objects? It's just all very confusing and I'm not sure it's nailed down yet.</li>
</ol>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, there is a test plan, but since there are only UI changes, there doesn't seem to be a need for an extensive test plan.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The explanaitions of the changes are excellent. They are able to relate the proposed changes to the problem statement, provide a visualization of the changes, are very detailed as to how the features will be implemented. One thing that is missing from these explanations is the files that they are modifying. If the doc had an overall section called <strong>Files modified</strong> or if each solutions explicitly stated which files are being modified and created, the explanations of the changes would benefit greatly.</p>",,,1,"<p>Their goal is to add a new function to expertiza like a role-based reviewing so that students can select their role(duty) of an assignment and will be reviewed through a role-based evaluation rubric. According to their wiki, all their proposed changes are reasonable and necessary to achieve their goal, so it's hard to tell if their design and code are problematic. But I noticed a minor problem: In ""Files that have to be modified"", you may miss ""view/"" for the last three directories because I just can't find such directories.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors have done a great job explaining the intent of the project. But they still have not changed the ""present scenario"" and ""proposed implementation"" mix-up. The authors need to separate these into different sections.</p>
<p>Secondly, the proposed implementation should also contain details of the application files (views/models etc) that needs changing.</p>
<p>The authors have added a new Test Plan but the tests are not mentioned. UI tests are done using capybara in rails. Such tests are already present in the application. They need to add such tests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>There is no mention of methods which will be affected only class has been mentioned.</p>
<p>From what I can say there would be a need to add controller, model and view of duties, in the duties table should there be a reference to rubric associated with the duty, also the primary key would be based on the name of duty and instructor id, it would have been better if they mentioned this in the files to be added&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The designs are well visualized, so it is apparent that the team has a clear direction for their proposed changes. In addition, the changes appear to be based on the view, so code smells and complicated code are quite unlikely. It can then be concluded that the changes will not affect the runtime of the system. The design appears thorough, and the team has a clear sense of what to do. I would suggest that a visualization be put in place for the second proposed change, as there currently isn't one.</p>",,,1,"<p>The UI design changes suggested by the team sound reasonable. They have provided detailed screenshots of the changes they want to make. One addition they could do is add application flow diagrams. Right now, it is not very clear, where in the application their design changes will happen.</p>",,,-1,<p>The designs are simple individually. They authors have done a good job in explaining them as well. The screenshots with each feature are particularly helpful.</p>,,,1,<p>The authors have done a great job adding all the required screenshots in the documentation. An improvement on this would be to add more application flow diagrams to explain the various scenarios.</p>,,,1,<p>The authors have not given any clear test plan. The test plan section talks about manual testing. But automated testing is possible and is done with capybara. There are examples present in expertiza code that the authors can review.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. The authors have provided detailed explanations with pictures that makes it easier to understand what the UI is right now and what changes they plan to make.</p>,,,-1,<p>I don't think that the team missed any section and explained each section in detail.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. The design doc is simple and clear. Relays the message authors are trying to convey in a concise manner.</p>,,,1,"<p>The visual aids are used very well. Not only did the team use visual aids illustrate the problems in the exisiting system, but they also used them to illustrate their prorposed changes in detail. As opposed to a paper or whiteboard mockup, the team put in the time to alter screenshots and create digital visuals to accurately depict their changes. The only issue is as mentioned before; one of the proposed changes (<strong><span id=""Issue_2:_Updating_Review_Summary_view_2"" class=""mw-headline"">Updating Review Summary view</span></strong>) does not have a visual aid, even though the change affects the view.</p>",,,-1,<p>Had lots of screenshots to explain the project.</p>,,,1,<p>The team has done a good job with the UML diagram that have provided. Only suggestion that I could give is to provide a small explanation for the UML diagram so that it is bit easier to understand.</p>,,,-1,<p>They have mentioned that they will manually run the tests for each functionality they want to add and upload the video. But they did not mention what kind of tests they will write.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>In general the document is really good and complete . I appreciate the teams effort in analyzing the requirement .

<p><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: 12.8px;"">2.

<p>It appears that Question has a single Questionnaire, but Questionnaires don't have <em>any</em> Questions, which doesn't sound like that makes sense.</p>
<p>It also appears that User just has a random line attached to Duty, which isn't a thing in UML class diagrams.</p>
<p>I can definitely see this diagram being incredibly handy for understanding the design if fixed and improved, but, as it stands, it's just confusing.</p>
<p>It does seem like the design isn't figured out yet, though, and the diagram just reflects what the current understanding is.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have explained the changes to be made very well. They have made use of visualization tools wherever applicable to show what the system would like after they have finished implementation. They have also gone to the extent of mentioning what columns/rows&nbsp;in a view would require modification.&nbsp;Good job!</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes the design talks about all the functionality that were addressed according to the requirements document&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The UML diagram looked very informative.

<p>adding a diagram after change for issue 2 would have been better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also , if possible, where in the code the changes are to be made could be added&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, it does. Based on what they've written, it appears that they've identified exactly the right parts that need to be modified in order to get achieve the goals of this project.</p>",,,1,<p>The UML diagram is a really nice touch that allows a lot of information to be shown quickly and concisely.

The team could have added a screen mock up but that can be overlooked considering the amount of detailing in the document.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The team has made very good use of visualization. They have clearly indicated what the current issues with the UI are, and what the UI would look like after they have implemented their changes. Good work!</p>",,,1,<p>The design doc contains a UML diagram to explain the functionality. But I suggest they add a small explanation of the diagram in order to make it more easy to follow.</p>,,,1,"<p>There was a single UML diagram which was a class diagram that was very detailed and also showed the relationships between the classes. But I felt that at this stage, a usecase diagram and an activity diagram would have been better choices to help explain the problem clearly. There was also no mockups, hence I am deducting 2 points.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has mentioned that they would manually test UI and upload a video to show their changes. However, I don't think this would be sufficient. One of their planned functionalities is to have an alternating color scheme appear in the table when the items are sorted.&nbsp;This change would not only require modifications to the view but also possibly to the associated controller/helper. The controller and helper can be tested through automatic testing.</p>",,,-1,<p>diagrams are added for the UI point of view and are seen to be good . No UML diagram were shown in the report on what calls are going to be made to accommodate the required changes</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes. The team has explained&nbsp;how current expertiza is and what changes they plan to make it better.

The only suggestion I would make would be to outline the problem in all three problem statement screen shots; this would mean outlining the white space in red for issue 2 and maybe adding an arrow stating that a red review is really red because the author did not resubmit. This would help make the screenshots more stand-alone.</p>,,,-1,<p>The design document is well written. It contains all the major topics such as overview of the project.

<p>Each line has <em>two</em> numbers on it, though, which is rather confusing. A question has one Questionnaire... or... wait, does a Question have many Questionnaires? It says that Questionnaires have many Questions in the description, but the diagram doesn't quite say that. The diagram only says that Questions have Questionnaires.</p>",,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team has mentioned that they have used factory design pattern however I think that it doesn't quite qualify. The factory pattern lets subclasses decide which classes to instantiate.According to the link for Factory pattern provided in the Wiki, the constructor should be made private so that the factory methods are called based on the type of Review report. However, the class implemented by the team just invokes the constructor with different set of arguments. Using a hash table would save some of the code lines.

They have used the factory design pattern and the implementation is correct and adheres the principle of this design pattern.</p>,,,1,"<p>They use factory design patterns, break up the long original codes and make it much more succinct.

I did feel that certain names were really long, but they did make sense as to what they mean.

The team has posted snippets of all the changed code in the wiki. This has made the document unnecessarily lengthy without much information about the project or the refactoring itself.

I just have one doubt, what kind of questionnaire will the SRQ be?A dropdown, checkbox or a Text field.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The changes proposed are very easy to follow and are adequate because of the flowcharts and screenshots provided along with explanations for each.

It's not hard to follow and I can understand it clearly for most part. However I am not too clear on how the grading will work. Initially it is mentioned that these supplementary questionnaire will not be graded but the UML diagram mentions that the SRQ scores would be appended to the original review scores. Also I'm not sure as to whether these would be optional or not. If they are optional, I believe people wouldn't be keen on answering them. If they are not graded, it is not fair for some people reviewing to do additional work in reviewing the team's work. It could be added as an optional bonus if answered.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Very good explanation. While the topics aren't super simple and the explanation alone may have been tough to understand, the UML diagrams plus screenshots really make it quite easy to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Very easy to follow any your design makes sense. I think the only tricky thing will be ensuring that you are displaying the correct questionnaire for each team. Assuming that a questionnaire for each team would be unique then this should be pretty straightforward.</p>,,,-1,"<ol>
<li>Nope. They're adding the methods where they should be.</li>
<li>I think they might be about to make code that interfaces with the tables directly instead of using objects to abstract it away. If that's true, then it'll make it real smelly.</li>
<li>I'm not familiar enough with rails to make this call. I doubt that there are any gems that do this.</li>
<li>I mean, it might. I don't see why it would, though.</li>
<li>I think they have a good starting place, but I'm just concerned about that object v. table thing.</li>
</ol>",,,-1,"<p>The authors did not provide the specific methods that would be touched upon during this project.</p>
<p>The designed was well explained, but I felt they could have explained the flow chart a bit more and they could have explained the exact changes they would make in each of the files.</p>",,,-1,"<p>In the Proposed solution section, the team states ""<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"">However, they will increase the benefit that each person gets because they can get feedback that is specific to their project."" I am not sure how each person is benefited. The project document states that the grades don't have to be considered as the questions will be too easy. Is so, how will the project ensure the quality of questions, especially since they are not graded. Students might be tempted to skip these questions all together.</span></p>",,,-1,"<p>The design appears to be very sound. The authors have clearly thought out the implementation and design process. This is obvious from the files list they have added, and the detailed implementation details they have provided. None of the problems mentioned above seem to exist.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes , the design proposed by the team looks neat for most of the part and doesn't look smelly. It mostly involves changes in the migrations and the views and thus seems to be pretty DRY. It should be fast and should solve the mentioned problems.</p>
<p>However, I have a few suggestions. Firstly I can the whole design and correlation would be neater if a separate table was created for the supplementary review questions and linked to the teams with a foreign key instead of just creating a column and populating it with the ID every time a questionnaire is created. Inside the subclass created they can have a no review method which can be checked every-time to check if supplementary questions are added.</p>
<p>Also this team had stated that the supplementary review questions added are not be graded. But in the flowchart, it is said that the scores of these extra questions are appended to the review scores. But my question is if these extra questions are not graded, why score them at all and add their scores.?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in the test plan , it says some tests need &nbsp;to be added for response controller and the assignment controller. However , I suggest if you think through these tests and include them in the doc, it would be great. This way the reviewer can understand what corner cases are you thinking of and maybe come up with some cases of their own which would improve your tests.</p>",,,1,<p>The team mentioned the files to be modified. If possible addition of a little bit more finner details will be really helpful to answer this question&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>Files that need to be changed are listed. Can only comment on the code changes when the design proposals are implemented.</p>,,,1,"<p>The proposed solution seems adequate for the requirements. They have proposed to make an extra view where the users(students) can add extra questions in the review,&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has mostly figured out as to where the changes need to be made. And the design for most part seems to be sound. However, like states earlier, I am not too sure of whether the design should be as stated. It takes a lot of effort for a reviewer to review a work and burdening him with additional work should come as optional and with a bonus to provide incentive.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Not a ton details (like classes) were added to the design document.&nbsp; However, of all the details that were added, none of them are ""smelly"" or seem to have any problems.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>This is a good design for the task at hand</p>,,,-1,<p>The subject like instructor should use a different shape to be distinguished from actions.</p>,,,1,"<p>The diagrams are super messy. There are both arrows that turn into other arrows at corners and lines that properly continue through the corner. There are places where multiple control flows combine into one and there's no combination diamond there, they just awkwardly kinda kiss</p>
<p>These are flow diagrams that have blocks like ""Instructor"" and ""Student (team_id)"" and ""Your Work"" that are clearly not actions that are being taken. There's also no start node or end node in any of them (the little black circle in a white circle and the other little black circle that's on its own)</p>
<p>There's also a decision block (is SRQ enabled?) that has one exit and no condition on said exit.</p>
<p>They would definitely be useful if they were actually UML flow diagrams, I'm sure, but they're mostly just confusing. The first one is probably unnecessary, though. It just kinda looks like a list of buttons the user is pressing.</p>
<p>The screenshots are nice, though. Love those.</p>",,,-1,<p>The images and visual aids explain the flow very well. There were no UML diagrams in the document though.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The team has made good use of flowchart and screen captures to explain functionality. There is not much text, given that the diagrams are sufficient to understand the work flow. The changes that will be made in the User Interface are also represented and it makes the document that much more crisp and clear.</p>",,,1,"<p>A lot of visual aids are provided - 3 flowcharts &amp; 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>1) some diagrams are unnecessary and do not help reader understand this project</p>
<p>Not true. The flowcharts are very essential for understanding the flow of implementation and control.</p>
<p>2) some UML diagrams do not follow the conventions</p>
<p>There are no UML diagrams in the document.</p>
<p>3) some diagrams are too high-level design and do not provide enough details</p>
<p>Not true. Sufficient explanation is provided for each diagram.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the diagrams added are very helpful. The flowcharts added make their implementation ideas quite clear. They have added mock links in their views and added screenshots of that. I believe this is amazing as it gives the reviewers an idea of how the implementation would look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one suggestion would be to include the UML diagram , to explain the data flow from the controllers and models to the view files. This would make the implementation idea extremely clear and easier for the reviewer to gauge the implementation.</p>",,,1,<p>Good visual aids were used in explaining the requirements . UML diagrams provided required infromation&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,"<p>The screenshots depict the proposed solutions quite nicely. Some more screenshots can be added for the features described - like the review results page.</p>
<p>Also, the first flowchart for creating SRQ seems quite unintuitive, as it connects the instructor enabling SRQ and student creating a SRQ.</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have posted a lot of pictures and flow diagrams explaining the solution. This makes the solution clear for a reviewer. They have described the design strategy with flow charts which is nice.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The UML diagrams are helpful and they have explained it with the use of mockups pretty well and hence I don't feel the need for further details regarding the flow they would take. The images convey what the current system is like. They also have some images depicting how it would look after the changes. My only concern is with the UML diagram as stated earlier about SRQ grades which contradicts with what was stated earlier. Overall, well done.</p>",,,-1,<p>UML diagrams and screenshots were both included in this document.&nbsp; As stated above they really help in relaying the information to the reader.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>Your flow charts helped me understand what exactly you are doing. I do think that there should be a screenshot of the review page and the review results page to stay consistent and to just illustrate where your changes will be implemented.</p>,,,-1,<p>Massive improvements on this one from the first round. Good job.</p>,,,-1,<p>The details are very well explained including the flow charts. They are visually very appealing</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, the authors have adequately explained the changes to be made to the system. The authors have clearly stated the problem statement and the solution they have proposed to tackle it. The flowcharts and the mock links added are quite descriptive and makes the ideas of the author easy to understand. They have also corrected the minor errors in the flowchart from the last submission which is great. Overall the document is designed well and the readers can understand it really well.</p>
<p>However, one small problem that I encountered is that , in the files to be modified section, they have only given a very high level explanation of what they intend to do. Thus , while their ideas and design are clear , their implementation plan is not apparent to the reviewers. For example - in the response controller file, they have mentioned that these are the files that need modification. I believe they should have specified what types of medications are required and whether they need to modify an existing method or create new methods.</p>
<p>Thus, I suggest including a short explanation of the exact changes in the files to be modified section will make it easier for the reviewers and the readers to understand and gauge the implementation thought by the authors.</p>",,,-1,<p>The team had made a very good attempt in explaining the changes . They were in a very clear format&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>The document is well done and complete. It explains all the changes involved in adequate detail.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the authors have explained the changes that are supposed to be made to the system with enough details. The changes that are supposed to be made in the visual interfaces are mentioned along with a list of files that are going to be altered during the course of the project.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The explanations seem to be much better than the previous wiki explanation. They have also updated their UML diagram to correctly reflect what they are proposing. They have also added appropriate notes for further clarifications that I had. It mentions how the reviewee is benefited by asking the questions. However, I feel that the wiki misses out on explaining how the reviewer is benefited for doing extra work. Maybe the team can talk to the instructor on as to how to address this.</p>",,,-1,<p>Very clear on what exactly the problem is and what your implementation is going to be. The visual aids really helped.</p>,,,-1,<p>Massive improvements on this one from the first round. Good job.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design appear to be sound and follows the appropriate design patterns</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the design appears to be quite sound. They have included a detailed design proposal which explains the concept they have in mind very well. The design is neat and accurate and addresses all the problems in the problem statement. The overall design flow is also accurate and without any fallacies. They mostly require changes to be made to the views such as adding checkboxes and additional questions so that part of the implementation would be DRY.</p>
<p>They have mentioned that they will be creating a subclass of questionnaires controller called SRQ. However , they haven't provided any implementation details such as what methods this class would have. Since it is a subclass of the questionnaires controller, I would suggest to use inheritance to its fullest.</p>
<p>Also, I did not really understand how exactly the appending of the questionnaires would work. I would suggest to include some details about how this appending would function which would make it easier to understand for the reviewers.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design was clear and was seen to go on well with the appropriate patterns . They wernt major changes being proposed from code point of view, but everythign was in place</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes the design seems to be sound , the different topics are well explained and seem to have enough information under them. I feel the different approaches or design alternatives could also have been mentioned.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design document looks to have all relevant details about what the team has set out to achieve. They have mentioned all details about the files they are concerned with, which is good. There are no mentions of the design principles or patterns they will be using and this is important since they are building a new model as well. However the UML diagrams mostly depict the approach they plan on using.</p>",,,1,"<p>At a top level, the design looks good though, knowing expertiza, It may be a little more complex once you start digging into it</p>",,,-1,<p>Massive improvements on this one from the first round. Good job.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design appears to be simple but includes all the necessary&nbsp; requirements</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design proposed by this team appears to be simple and concise. They have covered most of the necessary information about the proposed design and is easy to follow.</p>
<p>However, there are some parts in the design that needs some more explanation and can increase the complexity. One thing , that I can think of is that they have mentioned that the scores for the questions added by students would not be graded. They have not specified , how they are going to differentiate the two types of questions and how exactly would this logic function.</p>
<p>I suggest to consider such borderline cases and write test cases for it to ensure accurate functionality.</p>",,,-1,<p>The proposed design is very simple and very intuitive. I believe it will be very useful.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes the design is simple , well explained and consists of all the important details about the project. They have first defined the problem, drawn the design strategy in a graph like manner and then have explained the user interface changes that are supposed to be done.</p>",,,-1,<p>The approach the team will be taking seems to be simple and efficient in terms of how I can visualize the system to be. They plan to handle the additional questions well and are avoiding complicated changes to the existing system.</p>,,,-1,<p>Very simple. They are manipulating current functionality of expertiza&nbsp;to add this feature.</p>,,,-1,<p>The diagrams they gave are pretty good. it's enough for readers to understand their design just by looking into the diagrams without reading other explanation.</p>,,,-1,"<p>MASSIVE step up from the first round.</p>
<p>The flow diagrams are actually valid flow diagrams now!</p>
<p>The screenshots are a bit excessive, but the improvements are clear.</p>",,,-1,<p>The design diagram is visually very appealing. The authors have done a very nice job with the use of flowcharts</p>,,,-1,"<p>Yes, the visuals added in this doc greatly assist in understanding the overall design of the authors. They flowcharts added and very descriptive and make the intentions of the team quite clear. The screenshots with the mock links added also prove helpful in understanding the endoderm goal of this team and how the results would look like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However , I would have loved to see a UML or a use case diagram which would have made the data flow across models controllers and views quite clear. The exact processing order and data movement would have been made clear with a UML and the different scenarios can be covered with a use case diagram. This would have strengthened the doc submitted by this team.</p>",,,-1,"<p>A very good work was done with viscualizations , every click was explained with a view that made is easy to follow</p>",,,-1,<p>The authors have taken into consideration feedback from the 1st round and improved the flowcharts. It makes much more sense now and is easier to comprehend. Additional screenshots were added which also helps.</p>,,,-1,<p>Yes the team has used a flow diagram and have uploaded screenshots of the changes that are supposed to be made. This makes it very clear to the reviewer where the changes are going to be made.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The UML diagrams are helpful and they have explained it with the use of mockups pretty well and hence I don't feel the need for further details regarding the flow they would take. The images convey what the current system is like. They also have some images depicting how it would look after the changes.They also fixed the previous contradicting UML diagram. So, good work.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Like mentioned before, the visuals were great at pointing to what exactly you are planning to do.</p>",,,1,"<p>It's better if they can describe their test plan with the anticipated test files, e.g.&nbsp;student_review_controller_spec.rb<span style=""color: inherit; font-size: inherit;"">.</span></p>",,,-1,"<p>The tests are pretty limited, but they seem like they would get most the functionality tested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure I would've realized there were any problems if you hadn't told me, though.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes, the design includes a detailed test plan</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, a hierarchical test plan has been included which explains the testing scenarios they have in mind. However I believe that the current test plan included is too short and just provides an overview of testing. Since this team plans on adding a new class and altering views for it, they should thoroughly test the functionality.</p>
<p>I suggest to include a detailed test plan, where each scenario is described and the different tests for that scenario are mentioned. This would enable the reviewer to gauge the test plan and maybe provide an insight into any of the cases that may have been missed by this team.</p>
<p>I scenario that I can think of is that they should test if the correct questions are graded. Like the extra student generated questions are not graded.</p>",,,-1,<p>A basic test plan was mentioned but it was at a very high level&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>A basic test plan is included which I feel tests all the essential changes being made.</p>,,,1,"<p>The test plan seems to be superficial and shallow. The team could have mentioned the different scenarios in the controllers and models that are going to be changed , They could just mention the changes these files will have and can briefly mention all the possible test cases that can be implemented on these files.</p>",,,1,<p>The test plans seem to be short on the number of tests they plan to run but they mention that they will be working on it as and when they progress in terms of developing the application. So hopefully they will have a very well tested feature.</p>,,,-1,"<p>Proposed tests look solid. Maybe add a test for if a student doesn't add supplementarily questions, that the system still acts accordingly</p>",,,1,"<p>This team has provided a good enough explanation to support the proposed changed. However, at some places the explanation is too brief and is almost just stating which is given in the problem statement. I would suggest , that they can explain the solution of each problem in a some detail so that it is easier to understand. Maybe a few examples can be added to aid understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also one thing I would like to point out that the first flowchart is not clear. The flow is quite distorted as it connects the instructor views with the student . I don't think thats quite accurate. Instead a separate flowchart for the instructor side and the student side can be created. This would make the flowchart easier to follow and also track the data flow.</p>
<p>In the first flowchart, there is a design box with only one path without any indication for yes and no. I would suggest to fix this before the next submission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>The design from the explaination in the wiki shows steps very clearly and they are minor changes in different views and it was in the flow of the general expertiza style&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>The code is clear and easy to follow. However, it is pretty much the basic code generated by scaffold generation. In the authorize method of the application controller, the notice just says ""XYZ"". This could be changed to a more specific message.The homepage controller has only two empty methods, create and new. This implies that its function is just to manipulate the views. I feel that this could be implemented in the user controller itself instead of creating a new controller for it.</p>",,,1,"<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- No violations of Ruby on Rails coding practices.</p>
<p>- Proper naming conventions used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>- Validations need to be added. (regex, empty values, etc.)</p>
<p>- Relationships should be defined clearly. (eg: has many, belongs to)</p>",,,1,"<p>The code follows good Ruby on Rails coding practices. The code implements most of the functionality. The code was maintained properly in Git. However, There are some functionality issues that I have come across during my review process. They are</p>
<p>points to improve</p>
<p>1) The job seeker is associated with a company by default which needs to be changed.</p>
<p>2) The recruiter&nbsp;was not able to see the applications that the job seekers have&nbsp;applied.&nbsp;</p>

Like using stylesheets to make the interface elegant&nbsp;and smooth.</p>,,,-1,<p>The interface is easy to use.</p>,,,-1,<p>the application was easy to follow through</p>,,,-1,"<p>Deployment:</p>
<p>The application was deployed on the Heroku platform and the corresponding github repo was also shared. The deployment was done properly and I had no issues opening up the application and running it. As soon as I clicked on the deployed app link, I was redirected to the home page of the system, which was the login page. The database migrations were also done properly as I was able to register and login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;User interface:</p>
<p>The user interface was minimalistic and easy to use. Everything was self explanatory and most pages were linked properly. Only the back button of the view job applications page was wrongly linked, otherwise everything was fine.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, the application has been deployed successfully.&nbsp; The user interface is clean, and though it is a little bland, it is easy to use.&nbsp; The ReadMe is helpful when getting up and running with the application.&nbsp; It does a good job explaining how to login as an admin and such.&nbsp; One area I see for improvement still is in the readme layout and styling.&nbsp; Github allows for the use of markup to style and edit readme and wiki documents on github.&nbsp; This is a great tool for creating tables, headers, and bullet points to help make documents more readable.&nbsp; If I were to give your team one suggestion moving forward with this section, it would be to give markup a try to help make the ReadMe and other documentations more readable.&nbsp; Here is a helpful resource regarding markup shortcuts, and how to use them!&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet</p>",,,-1,"<p>The main approach of the project as seen from the documentation is to refactor long, complex methods into smaller methods so there is no evidence of functions that are too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to add more comments so that it becomes easier for someone who is analyzing the code for the first time. As comments help such users to understand what exactly happens in the code.</p>",,,1,"<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml>

<p>It can be seen that the code follows heavy java convention, but that comes naturally for java developers</p>
<p>I liked the fact that before action was used well</p>",,,-1,"<p>The user interface is very easy to use, you can have control of job seeker or recruiter at one time which is a good thing.</p>

Most of the code is scaffold generated hence they strictly adhere to the applications structure for MVC. They code is also properly formatted with proper indentation. One things missing is the lack of comments in the code. The authors could improve on that.</p>,,,-1,"<p>The UI design is uniform, easy to use and appealing. The team has used bootstrap for some of the UI component, which makes it look better.&nbsp; Also, there is a navigation panel on top to switch between parts of the application. Overall, great job on the UI part.</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has generated the required scaffold for test setup for Rspec. But they have not specifically added test cases. For example, if we look into the models folders in specs, we only see the company_spec.rb file that does not have any test cases. Whereas, for controllers, they have the default generated test cases.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes. There has been a steady increase in the commits. I can see the maximum activity on Thursday. The commits are also properly named. Although the frequency of commits not high (43 total). The team should commit more often so that they don't lose valuable work.

The diagrams for calculation are very helpful.</p>,,,1,"<p>The design documentation contains overview of the project and the proposed implementation, four different approaches for combining self review and peer review. They have not included that need modification. They have included a Test plan but it only contains which test cases they want to test. They could have included how are they planning to test them.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,<p>Yes the design has incorporated all the functionality.</p>,,,1,"<p>The explanation provided is good, but they could have explained the four score formulas in more detail.

Although I suppose the authors could elaborate more on certain aspects like planned approach, files changed, etc. Overall the team has done a good job but the document could have been more thorough if it included more details about the approach.</p>
<p>Suggestion: If possible, provide detailed explanation of what you plan to do and how you intend to achieve that.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Yes after comparing with the specification, the authors seem to have mentioned every required functionality in the documentation.</p>",,,1,"<p>Well according to me the planned approach section is a bit small, like I suppose the authors should explain their approach in detail. They have done a good job considering the options for Score calculations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion: In the planned approach section you have mentioned what needs to be done. If possible, you can add some explanation about how you intend to do it i.e. in terms of the files that will need modification and something on the code level. This will make the document will be more complete.</p>",,,1,"<p>The design has not been discussed in much detail. So it is a bit difficult to make a comment on the aspects specified in the question.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Try to&nbsp;explain the design using aspects similar to those mentioned in this question so that the reviewer will be able to help you with some suggestions if he feels there might be some error in your approach.</p>",,,1,"<p>The visual aids that were included depicted the score calculations. These gave a rough idea of how the calculations work.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Apart from the score calculations, you can include screenshots of the view UI where you plan to make changes. Eg. The project wants the user to see the self review scores juxtaposed with peer review scores. So you could provide a screenshot which depicts the current scenario and then explain what changes you intend to make and how it will be different from the current scenario. Screenshots like these will help the reviewer get a visual idea of the changes that the project will provide to the existing application.</p>",,,1,"<p>The write up was certainly well structured and covered the basic sections (why they are doing it, what needs to be improved, how they plan to improve it). Not that this is something mandatory, but something I would like (as a person who is reviewing) is, I would also put up a side by side comparison of how their information would be different from the previous work. They have done their part of the job by adding link to previous work. I did try to skim through the link, however this is not your part, it was a long read and I had to figure out what was going on just by looking at the figures. Apart from this, good work on explaining your project.</p>",,,-1,"<p>At the time of reviewing, I was able to see that the testing section was empty and hence I believe that they are yet to work on that.

<p>Overall the naming conventions do not seem to be a problem, however, I would add some more comments describing briefly what each action in the controller intends/expects to do.</p>",,,1,"<ol>
<li>I do not think that they have any of the functions which are too long. They have followed a pretty neat style of coding</li>
<li>As said earlier, the code does look good however, I see there is some cleaning up left to do (file ex: github_data_cotroller.rb, lines: 65+)</li>
<li>I worked on a mozilla project, so I did not have a chance to work on any part of the code of expertiza. Overall, they seem to have followed good modularity. However, as I mentioned earlier, for better practices and for making reviewer's life easier, a brief description for a not-too short function could help.</li>
<li>The code does seem to follow the Ruby Style guidelines very well. They have defined actions in the controller which is a good practice.</li>
</ol>",,,1,"<p>They do seem to have a file: github_data_controller_test.rb but I do not see any piece of code written in it.

What does that mean? it isn't explained further in a sort of implementation section. That sounds good as a base problem, but I think they should expound upon that to include specifics. They do explain the background, that they want to include functionality to take metrics from Github and display them to instructors, which is pretty good. They describe their planned implementation, but don't go into project level specifics and actually explaining them going through the plan or how it works. They simply provide the interface by which they will receive these metrics, but not how it will talk specifically to Expertiza. I think they need to work heavily on shoring up their logical flow of information and explaining the implementation, as well as their thought process going through the 'how it works' section.</p>",,,1,"<p>There is no explanation of the actual implementation, only of the proposed plan, so I can't say they explained any of the work they did. I think they should work on adding these to the website as soon as they can, so we can get a idea of how things went.</p>",,,1,"<p>They do not have a test plan or any talk about implementation of tests. First i would recommend starting with ensuring everything works assuming all inputs are logical. Then i would ensure these metrics update in the Expertiza DB as commits are added, or whatever other metrics are being considered. These are just some ideas to start from, because testing in my opinion is truly the most important aspect.</p>",,,-1,"<p>I can't find a PR for this group, using the name of the PR or contributors. Honestly I dont know where to find the code to even check this, since there is no PR and its actually quite difficult on Github.</p>",,,1,"<p>As mentioned previously, I cant even find any code that was changed, so you should create a pull request or make it possible to see your additions.</p>",,,1,"<p>There were no tests added that I could tell, and so I would work on figuring out how you will test your contribution to Expertiza.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Unfortunately as we can't deploy our projects, I am unable to test their implementation.

I can easily understand the project is focused around the subject of fixing peer review scores, as fields that are left blank are included in the math to calculate average review score. I understand that their project and goal is to fix this issue, to enable a more accurate calculation of average peer review score. They also describe very coherently how the project fixes the issue. They explain in the '<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12.7px;"">/app/models/vm_question_response_row.rb</span>' model file, they alter code to exclude nil values from the calculation of peer review score, which are the values of those blank review score entries. Overall, i appreciate the thorough method in which they explain the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>They do explain how they did the work. In fact, they have a section well named 'Explanation' which talks about the implementation, and what they changed to enable correct functionality. Another note to point, it explains that the implementation directly corrects the problem they describe earlier on, meaning they talk about nil fields, and then they explain in the implementation how they fix this problem, which is good consistency. They don't explain why necessarily, but I think the explicit way they describe the problem and implementation implicitly answers the question. They did it this way because it leaves out those nil values recorded as an empty score field. They didnt use any design principles or patterns, but simply came up with a simple and quick fix to the issue.</p>",,,1,"<p>Due to the scope of their project, I can say the test plan looks complete. They tested essentially the three types of cases and then variations of them to thoroughly test their model. They test when scores are all non-nil, all nil, and a mixture of the two, which conceivably are the 3 separate blocks of cases. Then they further try tests where you have 0 in some, not in others, or nil mixed in, and it goes on from there. I think they covered all of the scenarios which pertain to their contribution.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Unfortunately since we can't deploy our projects, i cant test the author's work.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes they have converted all of their explained tests in the Test Plan into automated RSPEC tests. I can't test whether or not they fail, but I assume they do work due to the nature of them, though I believe they should explain on the website that they worked or not and show how they worked.</p>",,,1,"<p>It explains that in calculating the score it ignores the empty fields, so the score does not calculate the empty fields as a zero in the final calculation of the score.

The coverage seems to have decreased by 1%. This is likely due to the fact that they added code, but the code added to test this added functionality wasn't enough to increase the coverage.

Essentially, when a score was blank or nil, it was taken into consideration when calculating average score, even though it contributed nothing to the score. This in essence divided the score incorrectly to create the average. However after adding their code to fix this, the score is then calculated correctly. I definitely like how they included a video that explained what their project was, what they did to fix the problems outlined, and then going through and showing on the UI that the solutions worked.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think their writeup is sufficient.

However, the&nbsp; suggested changes do not go into much detail and are not well documented. Listing few sections of the wiki that will be updated would have added to the completeness of the doc. In addition, the testing plan was hard to extract, and doesn't go into much detail.

Also they should have a seperate section for a test plan. &nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The design copy and pasted the required funcionalities listed on the main document, so yes, objectively the design does incorporate them somewhat.

However, as long as the team does go back update the doc with the details of their changes, it will become easier to analyze the effectiveness on the design of the project.</p>",,,1,"<p>No visual aids were used, and it would be a bit tricky for the team to include any on this one. However, screenshot of how various tables in the DB are linked together presently would have been a nice use of visual aids. I would suggest somehow providing a visual aid that helps provide the rationale for each change made to the DB. This would allow for more understanding regarding the project and the impact of the changes.</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors proposed to review the DB schema and update the Wiki. However, no more detail at all was given, and as such it is difficult to gauge the quality of the explanations present.</p>",,,1,"<p>The item most similar to a visual aid is a list of DB fields given, which is not immediately useful if not accompanied with an explanation of what is being modified.</p>",,,-1,<p>Simple and concise</p>,,,-1,<p>It is unclear if they know how many databases need to be changed and how they plan to test if their changes cause side effects or how they plan to go about detecting unused databases</p>,,,-1,<p>They have explained that the databases that are unused need to be removed.&nbsp;</p>,,,-1,<p>No Diagrams present however there is a huge list of databases which is unnecessary as a design doc</p>,,,-1,<p>No test plan outlined</p>,,,1,"<p>They explain the project purpose well, but when they explain the design, or what they will do satisfy this purpose, I feel they could be more explicit. Perhaps in the resubmission they could explain the exact places they will look and files that will most likely end up being changed, but this document is fairly lacking as it is. Also, the testing plan only states that they will ensure previous tests work. What are the pivotal tests that must work? Graphical inclusion would be a great idea, and im not sure listing the entire documentation is too great of an idea too because its rather confusing and doesnt actually explain what&nbsp;<em>their&nbsp;</em>contribution will be.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There were actually no explanations given because they don't have any of their own design plans documented, just what was placed in the requirements document. I think they can come up with their approach, or a few, and explain them.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think the plan laid out could work out, but they will have to be very cautious because this is a fairly destructive project. Also I think they will have to make sure to be on the same page and double check each other before they decide to make changes. I definitely think more effort should be expended on the design as there doesnt seem to be much design as of yet. If they perhaps make it a modular design where they effectively peruse each DB table, maybe they can come to a more coherent and logical design they can then document.</p>",,,1,"<p>As I stated in my first review, the author does not appear to have proposed any changes out side of reiterating the project description.&nbsp; Since this project mainly focuses on clearing up the DB, I do not feel as though there is really any need for formal documentation such as wireframes or UML documents to be made.&nbsp; That being said, it is important that the team lay out a plan of action so that both reviewers and other team members alike have a good idea what is going on.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has not included a test plan.&nbsp; That being said, they may not need one since the project only requires them to rewrite some of the database files.&nbsp; Because of this, they may only need to check to make sure previous tests pass.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The team has not included any visualizations or diagrams.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, it might not be necessary to include a UML or a wireframe since the team is mainly focusing on rewriting the DB files.&nbsp; But, they should certainly include some diagrams explaining what they will be changing visually.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>They do not provide any visual aids, which I think would be a great idea. Perhaps including a mock-up DB table that would then be able to show how thios project would impact expertiza. Or maybe there is some metric whereby cleaning up the extraneous references that are unneeded would affect it, and they can somehow visually represent the impact their design will have.</p>",,,1,"<p>While the team has described the problem statement in their design document, the rest of their document seems to be a bit shallow. In my original review I had suggesting writing a UML or Wireframe to describe the technical layout of the teams project. This does not appear to be implemented as of yet, but is something I would highly suggest focusing on before you all begin the coding portion of your project.&nbsp; Having a wireframe and UML written up really helps all members of a team to stay on the same page as everyone can just reference the wireframe or UML when coding different portions of the project.&nbsp; This way, when everyone is working on different tasks, each member understands the big picture, and can implement a more moduler and appropriate solution.</p>",,,1,"<p>While the team reiterates the project description, they do not appear to hvae worked though any design decisions as of yet.&nbsp; This is something I pointed out in my first review.&nbsp; To keep a team unified towards a common goal, it is critical that a well&nbsp;laid out design document be written up.&nbsp; Because of this, I highly suggest that you all focus on writing up a design plan before beginning to code.</p>",,,1,"<p>&nbsp;The teams work is to modify the expertiza db to make it more&nbsp;functional removing the db. This message was clearly conveyed&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>. The test plan was not explicitly mentioned . May be the team would need to check if the functionaloty is still maintained if the table attributes are changed , which as said they would run all the tests again&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>&nbsp;Yes , the team's work was clearly conveyed and the same was explained in the document&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The Problem description section explains the general idea of the changes to be made, but really lacks some more information. I think the best way to improve on this is to update the bottom section (the list of DB) with the changes to be made to each DB as you progress through the project. Then the readers would easily be able to see the DBs that have changed AND the changes made to them.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The design in general is going to be to create rails migrations, as long as the team follows good migration practices this should be really straightforward for designs.&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>&nbsp;the explanation was crisp for most part . if it was possible to mention how they would plan to check all the attributes in a better way or go through each of them individually . I am just curious</p>,,,-1,<p>Again the design is to create migrations which should be rather simple to read and understand. As long as the team doesn't attempt to perform updates on several DB in a single migration then the design is sound and simple.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>No testing section is included, but the tests for this project are going to basically involve running the test from each other module that has some DB interaction.

The wiki page adds nothing to the project description.

The doc is very crude as of now and there is nothing much a person can make out of it. I would have loved if the authors had added some explanation, without which reviewing becomes very difficult.</p>",,,1,"<p>To be honest, I didn't get what the team is trying to propose because of inadequate explanation. If the team would have been a little bit more descriptive, it would have been easy to understand. The have listed some tables as deprecated, but without any explanation.</p>",,,1,"<p>Apart from just listing some tables as deprecated, there is nothing more added. It's impossible to figure out from the wiki what the authors plan to change or add.&nbsp;</p>",,,-1,"<p>The authors provide the general scope of their changes and the actions they plan on taking. However, it is not very clear what the authors are exactly going to do in the project.

That said, the authors could have added a more detailed explanation to compensate for lack of this particular aspect.</p>",,,1,"<p>It doesn't appear that a test plan is needed for this project.

However, the&nbsp; suggested changes do not go into much detail and are not well documented. Listing few sections of the wiki that will be updated would have added to the completeness of the doc. In addition, the testing plan was hard to extract, and doesn't go into much detail. I think overall, the team should add headings to the document that clearly outline what the problem and background of the project is, what their suggested solutions are, and a description of each solution. Also they should have a seperate section for a test plan. &nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>They have provided the general description, problems and resolving steps. They provide a detailed description of each object. But the picture they uploaded seems redundant.</p>",,,-1,<p>The purpose is defined but there is no description on how they will locate any redundant/unused data to remove it from the schema.</p>,,,-1,"<p>&nbsp;The teams work is to modify the expertiza db to make it more&nbsp;functional removing the db. This message was clearly conveyed&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>. The test plan was not explicitly mentioned . May be the team would need to check if the functionaloty is still maintained if the table attributes are changed , which as said they would run all the tests again&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The team has done a good job covering the projects purpose and the scope of the project as a whole.&nbsp; That being said, the team has not included a UML or Wireframe describing the technical layout of their porject.&nbsp; Furthermore, the team does not appear to have added testing plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the team has not done either of these two things, they seem to be on track given it is only one week into the project.&nbsp; I would suggest though, that moving forward the team focus on getting these technical documents written up so that they can all be on the same page when it comes time to begin implementing everything.</p>",,,1,"<p>The project purpose and some information on the issues present in the old design was given. However, the implementation plan is extremely vague and very short, and no information on the test plan is given.</p>",,,1,"<p>Yes, They include the content in first link to their wiki page.</p>",,,1,<p>They have covered the requirement of the problem description. It would be better if they explain the functionalities in detail.</p>,,,1,"<p>Yes, in their design description I can see all the required functionalities are covered which is good. However it's better if they can include a design plan/project plan to illustrate how they'd plan to meet the requirements&nbsp;in steps. They did write ""<span style=""background-color: #f9f9f9;"">The scope of our project is to rectify these problems by performing the below steps</span>"" but&nbsp;I think these &ldquo;steps&rdquo; are just the copy of the requirements and it's too abstract to figure out what they&nbsp;thought&nbsp;around these requirements.</p>",,,1,"<p>I think an example would really do wonders here. Its a bit hard to grasp exactly whats being changed? The word normalize makes it sound like the team will make each table have a similar/the same layout when that likely isn't possible. Maybe show a DB that has a few redundant fields and how you will fix that specific one, and then show the wiki page its connected to, and how you have to update that page?&nbsp;</p>",,,1,<p>Too early to evaluate the changes. Will modify the review when they have included their implementation steps.</p>,,,-1,"<p>To be honest, I didn't get what the team is trying to propose because of inadequate explanation. If the team would have been a little bit more descriptive, it would have been easy to understand. The have listed some tables as deprecated, but without any explanation.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The author does not appear to have proposed any changes out side of reiterating the project description.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this project is mainly focused on cleaning up the DB, I do not feel as though there is really any need for formal documentation such as wireframes or UML documents to be made.&nbsp; That being said, it is important that the team lay out a plan of action so that both reviewers and other team members alike have a good idea what is going on.</p>",,,1,<p>they explained the project very well. But they just didn't talk about details plan.</p>,,,-1,<p>They did not use diagrams and it would be much better if they did.</p>,,,1,"<p>No visual aids were used, and it would be a bit tricky for the team to include any on this one. However, screenshot of how various tables in the DB are linked together presently would have been a nice use of visual aids. I would suggest somehow providing a visual aid that helps provide the rationale for each change made to the DB. This would allow for more understanding regarding the project and the impact of the changes.</p>",,,-1,"<p>There are currently no UML diagrams, mockups, or screens and tables.&nbsp; That being said, this is not something that this team necessarily needs given their specific project is focused more on reworking the database.&nbsp; A suggestion for a diagram the team might add though could describe which portions of the database need to be reworked.&nbsp; Visual guides and diagrams really help reviewers and team members alike understand visually what is being worked on.&nbsp; Because of this, I would highly suggest sketching out a visual overview of the portion of expertiza that you and your team will be working on.&nbsp; Other then that, keep up the good work.</p>",,,-1,"<p>The item most similar to a visual aid is a list of DB fields given, which is not immediately useful if not accompanied with an explanation of what is being modified.</p>",,,1,<p>They have explained that the databases that are unused need to be removed.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,"<p>This project was very different from the others . At first it appears that the team had not exaplined anything , but reading through it was quite informative&nbsp;</p>",,,1,"<p>The authors provide the general scope of their changes and the actions they plan on taking. However, it is not very clear what the authors are exactly going to do in the project. I would suggest the doc include a ""Tables modified"" section, so that is clear which tables they have modified/created/removed.</p>",,,1,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black; background: white;"">Yes, they included the problem description which has clearly explained their goals. But it's kind of too short and just a copy of the requirements, so I'd recommend to write more thoughts about the project such as how to implement these changes in steps.</span></p>",,,1,<p>Simple and concise</p>,,,-1,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black; background: white;"">Yes. As they wrote in wiki it's very concise and easy to understand. But the problem is it's just too brief for readers to know details about their project. I'd recommend they could provide more information such as the involved files, the to-be-created files (since I saw their may write migrations) and the expected results.</span></p>",,,-1,<p>Again the design is to create migrations which should be rather simple to read and understand. As long as the team doesn't attempt to perform updates on several DB in a single migration then the design is sound and simple.&nbsp;</p>,,,1,<p>No test plan outlined</p>,,,-1,"<p>No, the testing has not been implemented.</p>",,,-1,"<p>Extra credit features have not been implemented.</p>
<p>Testing of one model and one controller has not been done.</p>",,,1,<p>The models and controllers&nbsp;have not been tested properly. The code for testing the models and controllers is not present. The could also have developed the testing code.</p>,,,1,"<p>The admin model hasn't been tested at all. The configured email and password is not being authenticated.&nbsp; When the show button is clicked while viewing the company/job information , the recruiter is being able to edit the job &amp;/ company info even if not belonging to that company. Furthermore, if a recruiter leaves a company, the jobs created by him/her are retained and can be edited/destroyed by the same recruiter which shouldn't happen according to the spec file. All these things should be take care of . You just have to put certain conditions in the appropriate views to display links to certain pages.</p>",,,1,"<p><!-- [if gte mso 9]><xml>
